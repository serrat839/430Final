The 2021 Chevrolet Suburban is all-new.

The Chevrolet Suburban is all-new for 2021, marking a full revamp for a sport utility vehicle whose name dates to 1935. The Suburban is Chevy’s largest SUV, with a length that outstretches its full-size Tahoe sibling. With room for up to nine passengers plus their gear, this 3-row SUV has long been the go-to vehicle for big, busy families. The Suburban differs from mainstream crossovers like the Chevrolet Traverse in that it has a rugged and trucklike body-on-frame chassis. That, combined with its powerful engine options, make it ideal for towing and hauling.
This new version of the Suburban is more appealing thanks to fresher technology, additional safety features and enhanced ride manners. That latter aspect comes thanks to an independent rear suspension, a modernized setup already put in place by the Suburban’s primary rival, the Ford Expedition Max. In addition to still winning the size and cargo-capacity war over the Ford, the Suburban further stands out with its V8 engine opposed to the Expedition’s twin-turbo V6. Also newly available for the Suburban is GM’s 6-cylinder turbodiesel that is regarded for its towing ability and fuel efficiency.
The Suburban is big in every way. Its size can be a handful in tighter confines and residential garages, while its starting price of nearly $52,000 is also larger than sedan-based crossovers. A loaded Suburban can eclipse $80,000, but it also brings a lot of metal for the money.
 2021 Chevrolet Suburban PricingThe 2021 Chevrolet Suburban has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $51,700 for a base LS model. Destination fee is $1,295 on all models. The more recommendable LT trim begins at $56,500, the RST is $59,800, and the Z71 starts at $61,900. At the higher ends, the Suburban Premium starts at $65,300 and the luxury-like High Country variant starts at $72,300. Four-wheel drive is an additional $3,000 (or standard on the Z71). Options can add thousands to these prices.
The new diesel engine costs $995 more than the standard 5.3-liter gasoline V8. You also can get it the luxurious Suburban High Country, where it represents a savings of $1,500 compared to the 6.2-liter gasoline V8.
The Suburban’s primary rival, the Ford Expedition Max, begins higher at nearly $56,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Suburban’s resale value has been about average in the past.

Driving the  2021 Chevrolet SuburbanDriving dynamics are a big part of the updates to this new model. Chevrolet has completely reworked the underpinnings of the SUV to deliver a vastly improved driving experience.
Gone is the live axle out back. It’s been replaced with a far more comfortable multilink suspension setup. You may think this means a lower towing capacity, but that’s not the case. The Suburban is still fully capable of handling the hauling with loads as high as 8,300 pounds. The lowest tow rating is 7,500 pounds. And, interestingly enough, it comes on the more powerful 6.2-liter V8-equipped versions of the big SUV. That engine produces 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque.
The base engine is a 5.3-liter V8, which makes 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. There is also a 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder turbodiesel available, and that mill produces 270 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. It’s the chassis changes mentioned above that make all the difference here, though. The ride is smooth and comfortable. And you can upgrade the ride further, as the Suburban is available with a magnetically damped suspension and an adaptive air suspension as well. The Suburban remains flat and composed when you’re just out cruising or if you’re hauling a trailer down a mountain pass.
Interior ComfortLike its sibling the Chevy Tahoe, the all-new Suburban comes with three rows and can seat up to nine people. The latter setup is only available on the base LS trim and if you opt for a front-seat bench. As such, it makes the Suburban a viable alternative to a commercial-type van for large families.
Most buyers will opt for an 8-passenger setup or, with second-row captain’s chairs, the comfortable 7-seat option. Passenger space is the same as that of the also-new Tahoe except in the third row. The Suburban’s last row has slightly better legroom and is now comfortable enough for adults. Where the Suburban really sets itself apart is in cargo room. Its extra length gives it an enormous 41.5 cubic feet of cargo space even with the third row up – 16 cubic feet more than a Tahoe.
Even more space is created as you fold rows. Setting down the third row creates 93.8 cubic feet, while folding the second row opens up 144.7 cubic feet. These numbers are all better than those of the Ford Expedition Max.
Up front, the Suburban’s cabin is updated yet familiar. Audio and climate controls still have easy to see and use dials, while the standard touchscreen has grown to 10 inches. Cool options include a digital rearview mirror that uses a camera feed for a wide-open view and a power-operated storage console between the driver and front passenger. Materials range from cloth seating to perforated leather.
Exterior StylingAs with its interior, the 2021 Suburban’s exterior is familiar yet fresh. It remains a giant rectangle with enough new elements to make it interesting. Among them are boomerang-like running lights up front between the massive grille, and forward-angled c-pillars on the sides.
All models except the base LS get a hands-free power-operated liftgate. The Suburban is over a foot longer than the Chevy Tahoe. This new model stretches 225.7 inches, nearly 19 feet. If you plan to park this in your garage, grab your tape measure first.
Favorite FeaturesMODEL VARIETY
From the High Country model that could nearly pass for a Cadillac Escalade to the Z71 off-road variant and the aesthetically menacing RST, there’s a Suburban for a variety of tastes. Six trims in all are available, plus plenty of options for your tastes.
DIESEL ENGINE
It’s been decades since the Suburban was offered with a diesel engine, and this new one is the powertrain many have been desiring. Though only 3.0-liters in size, this 6-cylinder turbodiesel has outsize power.
Standard FeaturesThe new Suburban is available in six trims: LS, LT, RST, Z71, Premier, and High Country. The least-expensive Suburban LS includes tri-zone automatic climate control, keyless open and push-button start, power front seats, remote start, and premium-cloth seats. The standard infotainment setup includes a 10-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and a 6-speaker audio system. Standard safety features include forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking.
If it’s within your budget and unless you need the 9-passenger option, we recommend stepping up to at least a Suburban LT trim. This model includes features that make life easier and more creature comforts. Among them are a hands-free power liftgate, leather interior, 9-speaker Bose audio, memory driver’s seat, wireless phone charging, auto-dimming rearview mirror, universal garage remote, and heated front seats.
All Suburban models include GM’s subscription-based OnStar connected services, plus 4G LTE integration with in-vehicle Wi-Fi.
Factory OptionsOne option we highly recommend is the Driver Alert Package. For $790 it adds active safety features like lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear parking sensors to the Suburban. This package comes standard on Premier and High Country models.
Suburban RST models include 22-inch wheels and darkened aesthetics. The off-road-oriented Suburban Z71 comes standard with the 4-wheel-drive (with a 2-speed transfer case) that’s optional on other trims, plus hill-descent control, all-terrain tires, and front skidplate.
The Suburban Premier has magnetic ride control, 12-way power front seats with heating and ventilation, power-release rear seats, navigation, 10-speaker Bose audio, and 8-inch digital instrument cluster. The new Suburban High Country includes the 6.2-liter V8, head-up display, surround-view camera, and rear camera mirror.
Air suspension is available on Z71 and High Country models. For towing duties, the Max Trailering Package adds a more robust radiator and cooling fan, plus hitch guidance and hitch view in the backup camera. Adaptive cruise control is reserved for top models.
Engine & TransmissionThe new Chevy Suburban offers a choice of three engines. Standard on all but High Country models is GM’s familiar 5.3-liter V8 that makes 355 horsepower. If you want the bigger and more powerful 6.2-liter V8 you’ll have to buy the top-line High Country model. New to the lineup is GM’s 6-cylinder turbodiesel. It is optional in all but the Z71.
All of the engines are tied to a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Suburban is rear-wheel drive (RWD) as standard and offers 4-wheel drive (4WD) across the line. Four-wheel drive is standard on the Z71. The Suburban’s towing capacity maxes out at 8,300 pounds.

The top trim is SR, coming in at $19,265. This has the most standard features, but it’s also eligible for a Convenience Package ($400) and premium paint ($395).
Admittedly, a few grand at this “most affordable new car” level can be a deal-breaker, but we still recommend the Versa SR if the budget allows. It has the most equipment and offers adaptive cruise control, which would still be under $20k.
Although the 2021 Versa is pricier than a Mitsubishi Mirage, the Nissan is far more substantial (the Mirage is noticeably under-powered) yet still competitive with the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio. Before buying, check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Versa.
In resale value terms, the Versa is about average, level with the Kia Rio. The previous leader among subcompact sedans was the Toyota Yaris, but that’s been discontinued for 2021 in the United States.

Driving the  2021 Nissan VersaThe Versa’s cabin is impressively quiet, and there’s no tinny sound when closing the doors. It’s more of an agreeable thunk.
The 122-horsepower engine starts with the push of a button and settles into a smooth idle. This amount of power is relatively modest, yet still adequate for commuting and weekend errands. Drive is engaged using a conventional shift lever.
When driving the 2021 Versa sedan in a sedate manner, the continuously variable transmission (CVT) works quietly and efficiently in the background, only becoming more vocal under hard acceleration. That’s when the CVT “upshifts” near the 6,500-rpm redline, doing its best to mimic a conventional automatic transmission. At 80 mph on the freeway, the engine is running at a relaxed 2,000 rpm.
The ride quality is also perfectly acceptable for everyday duties. And the body doesn’t lean that much through the corners.
The braking system includes 10.4-inch rotors up front and 8-inch rear drums (looking tiny inside the SV model’s 16-inch alloy wheels). It’s slightly disappointing to see drum brakes in a brand-new 2021 car, but they still deliver dependable stopping power even when driving the Versa with a bit of eagerness.
Thankfully, the steering does not feel over-assisted. And the flat bottom of the standard plastic steering wheel looks sporty, while also making a bit of extra space for the driver’s thighs.
Interior ComfortFive people can fit in the Versa subcompact sedan, although it’s better if there are only four adults on board. The seats are supportive and comfortable enough for longer trips, and there’s enough headroom up front for 6-footers.
The sloping roof encroaches on rear headroom, however. And the rear bench seat at the entry-level car with the 5-speed manual transmission does not fold forward to increase cargo capacity (as it does in every higher version).
Even though the plastics in the dash and door panels are hard, they are textured in such a way as to look higher-grade. In general, the presentation of information is clear, and the controls on the steering wheel are easy to use.
The instrument panel in the Versa SV features an analog speedometer on the right and a configurable thin-film transistor (TFT) display on the left. This can serve as a rev counter or show other information like tire pressures, average fuel economy, and radio stations.
Measuring 15 cubic feet, trunk space is only a tad smaller than that of a Toyota Camry midsize sedan.
Exterior StylingIt’s a trivial thing, but makes a big difference — having wheels that fill the fenders. Nissan gives its new Versa that attribute, while also bringing a family resemblance to its Altima and Maxima sedans.
Like those bigger cars, the 2021 Versa has a grille with a distinct V-shaped element and the impression of a “floating” roof created by black trim placed strategically on the rear pillars. It also has an impressively low drag coefficient of 0.29.
The top SR trim has extra visual interest with a black chrome grille, 17-inch alloy wheels (the base model has 15-inch steel wheels with plastic covers), and a small rear spoiler. Among the colors on offer for the 2021 Versa are Electric Blue Metallic, Monarch Orange Metallic, and Scarlet Ember Tintcoat.
Favorite FeaturesAUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING
This feature is standard in every 2021 Versa and a potential lifesaver. The Versa also will apply its brakes if something is detected in the car’s path while reversing.
7-INCH COLOR DISPLAY
A 7-inch color infotainment touchscreen is standard throughout the 2021 Versa range. Integrated nicely into the dash, this screen works well with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration (which is standard in the top two trims).
Standard FeaturesIn addition to automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, the 2021 Versa is a well-equipped subcompact sedan. Highlights include power windows, push-button start, cruise control, rear automatic braking, 7-inch infotainment screen, lane departure warning, and a 4-speaker audio system.
The Versa SV brings 16-inch alloy wheels, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, a 6-speaker audio system, and Nissan Safety Shield 360 — an array of driver assistance features that includes lane departure warning, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic high beams.
Factory OptionsThere aren’t many options for the 2021 Versa. No doubt anyone buying the lowest S trim will want to add the CVT if only for the reason that, after a few years, it will be easier to sell than a Versa with a manual transmission.
The Versa SR is eligible for the Convenience Package that adds adaptive cruise control, automatic climate control, and heated front seats.
Engine & TransmissionThe engine in every 2021 Versa is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder unit making 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. That’s a couple of horses more than the Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent, and a full 44 more than the Mitsubishi Mirage.
Front-wheel drive is the only arrangement. The base S model comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. Every other version has an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT), which is optional in the S trim.
The Hyundai Accent has an advantage of one mile per gallon in both the city and highway cycles when comparing figures relating to automatic transmissions. With a manual transmission, the Accent is even more frugal. The Kia Rio has the same engine as the Accent.

Automatic climate control becomes optional in the top trim

The 2021 Nissan Versa subcompact sedan provides much more than just a keen entry-level price. Now in the second year of a fresh generation, the Nissan Versa has matured into a well-considered car offering features more often found in larger and more expensive sedans.
These include advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. And the 2nd-lowest trim comes with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration. But it’s also things like usable interior space, a pleasant cabin, and a fuel-efficient engine that make the 2021 Versa well worth considering by potential buyers looking for the most affordable brand-new car they can get.
Nissan keeps the pricing in the teens while making the Versa competitive against the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio, and Mitsubishi Mirage. If anyone wanted something more along hatchback lines, Nissan also has the Kicks subcompact crossover.

The Equinox is a comfortable, roomy, and competent 2-row/5-passenger crossover SUV with an appealing price. But in its cutthroat segment, competitors are bringing more to the table. The CR-V and RAV4, for example, include more active safety and driver-assistance systems, and each also is available as a hybrid. Chevrolet has already announced that the forthcoming 2022 Equinox will add features to help it remain competitive.
 2021 Chevrolet Equinox PricingThe 2021 Chevrolet Equinox has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $23,800 plus a $1,195 destination fee for a front-wheel-drive base L model. Most buyers will be better off in an LS or LT, starting at $26,300 and $27,500, respectively. Equinox Premier models begin at $31,400. All-wheel drive is an extra $1,600 and requires the LS trim or higher. A loaded Equinox can top $40,000.
At its base price, the Equinox undercuts better-equipped rivals like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, and Subaru Forester. It’s closer in line with the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Before buying your new compact SUV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what people in your area are paying.

Driving the  2021 Chevrolet Equinox2021 Equinox models all use a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. That size might sound small, but it’s par for the course these days, and like others, it puts out surprising power. Its 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque translate to a decent job moving this SUV, and the engine pairs well with the standard 6-speed automatic transmission.
Chevy has dropped the 2.0-liter turbo for 2021 due to low demand.
We found the Equinox’s ride on the softer and more comfortable side. Cornering is acceptable but not as athletic as that of a Mazda CX-5. If you’re more inclined to heed the call of the wild, a Subaru Forester or Jeep Cherokee is better suited to off-pavement excursions.
The Equinox’s diesel engine is not available for the 2021 model year. If you’re among the few drivers seeking a diesel-powered small SUV, look to the Mazda CX-5. The Jeep Cherokee, meanwhile, is the remaining small mainstream SUV that still offers a V6 engine.
One gripe we have with the Equinox is the inability to disable its engine start/stop system, which cuts power at idle. The refreshed and forthcoming 2022 Chevy Equinox is adding a button to disable this feature, as is the case in rivals.
Interior ComfortThe Chevrolet Equinox has a useful and roomy 5-passenger cabin. The front seats are supportive and comfortable enough for long trips. A 7- or 8-inch touchscreen display sits in the center of the dash. Controls for common functions like fan speed, temperature, and audio are simple to use. Most Equinox models have basic cloth seating, but you can spruce it up with leather in the top-line Premier trim.
The 2nd-row bench has a recline feature and legroom is generous. The Equinox has good cargo capacity, if not the best in its class. With the rear seats folded you get 63.9 cubic feet of storage. That compares to 75.8 in the Honda CR-V or 73.5 in the Volkswagen Tiguan. The VW Tiguan is also among the few small SUVs that offer a third row.
We do like the Equinox’s sub-floor in the rear cargo for securing and hiding smaller objects and keeping them out of sight.
Exterior StylingOur eyes think the Chevrolet Equinox’s design is fresh enough to look good now and conservative enough to hold up in the future. At just over 183 inches long, the Equinox crossover SUV is large enough to have presence and small enough to easily fit in parking spaces and garages. Available roof rails add utility and bolder SUV looks. A power liftgate with programmable height is available on higher trims. Deep tinted glass is available starting on the LS trim.
Various packages add elements like a chrome grille surround and 19-inch wheels, or a more aggressive black-out treatment.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SAFETY SYSTEMS
Last year the Chevy Equinox finally caught up to the competition with its suite of standard active-safety features. Now included are automatic emergency braking, forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist, plus IntelliBeam automatic headlights.
STANDARD APPLE CARPLAY/ANDROID AUTO
True, no-cost smartphone integration is becoming all the norm in new vehicles these days — so much so, that it’s almost become a test of whether a vehicle is worth owning or not. The 2021 Chevy Equinox passes this test, allowing you to connect your smartphone and use it through the color touchscreen.
Standard FeaturesThe 2021 Chevy Equinox is available in four trims: L, LS, LT, and Premier.
The least expensive Equinox L comes with a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, keyless entry, and push-button start, an infotainment system with 7-inch display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, four USB ports, 17-inch wheels, and the Teen Driver system that can set parameters and relay information on driving habits. Other highlights include General Motors’ OnStar telematics system and a subscription-based 4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi. Standard safety features include forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist
The LS trim adds the ability to get all-wheel drive and includes a compact spare tire and floor mats, and opens the door for more options.
Factory OptionsThe more recommendable Equinox LT includes an 8-way power driver’s seat, tinted windows, high-intensity headlights, a color driver-information screen, and SiriusXM satellite radio. The LT trim also is available with the higher-powered engine.
The topline Equinox Premier includes blind-spot monitoring, a hands-free power liftgate, leather interior, 8-inch touchscreen with a high-def rearview camera, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, fog lights, 18-inch wheels, chrome exterior accents, heated exterior mirrors, LED headlights and taillights, and rear parking sensors.
If you want adaptive cruise control, which comes standard on rivals like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, you’ll have to get the most expensive Equinox Premier, then pay extra for it as an option. Other options include ventilated front seats, navigation, Bose audio, a panoramic sunroof, and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionOnly one engine is available in the 2021 Chevy Equinox. That powerplant is a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine with 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque. That’s enough oomph for most tasks, and is rated to tow 1,500 pounds. Front-wheel drive (FWD) comes standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional for better traction.
The 1.5-liter engine uses a 6-speed automatic transmission. All Equinox models have an idle start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle, such as at stoplights. Restarts can be annoying, and unlike in other vehicles, the system can’t be deactivated. A button to disable this is among the updates for the forthcoming 2022 Equinox.

Well, it’s no tale that through the month of April your local Chevrolet dealer is offering some tempting deals on select 2021 Chevy Silverado 1500 trucks.
Leading off the deals is a $309 per-month lease. It’s for 36 months on a 2021 Silverado 1500 Crew Cab 4×4 LT with the 2.7-liter turbo. This deal doesn’t require a security deposit, but does require $4,139 at signing. It also includes a 30,000 mileage limit. A $0.25 penalty will be assessed for each mile over the limit at lease end.
If you wish to finance your 2021 Silverado Crew Cab, how about the 0% APR deal General Motors Financial is offering for 72 months. Not everyone will qualify for this low rate. If you have your own financing, you can get up to $4,400 Customer Cash.

Driving the  2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabWe’ve driven the Chevrolet Silverado in many iterations and with several of its powertrains and have found it commendable overall. In general, Chevrolet’s Silverado drives smaller than it is and has good ride quality considering this is a rugged, body-on-frame pickup truck. Handling is taut with little body roll. Moreover, everything works well and in harmony, from its brakes to its steering.
As for powertrains, the 5.3-liter V8 will satisfy the majority of buyers. It offers good grunt with 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, and is connected to a 6-, 8- or 10-speed transmission, depending on configuration. The power-hungry will be more than satisfied with the even larger 6.2-liter V8 that doles out 420 horses and 460 lb-ft of torque. This invigorating engine easily propels the Silverado and, as a bonus, puts out a gratifying growl.
The 2.7-liter turbocharged-4 is commendable in its own right. It moves the Silverado better than you’d think and makes the truck feel lighter. Still, possibly our favorite powertrain is the turbodiesel inline-6. This diesel Silverado is efficient at up to 33 mpg and provides locomotive force. Unless you only require the most basic work truck, you’re probably better off skipping the base 4.3-liter V6.
Interior ComfortGiven its vast variety of configurations, it’s no surprise that the Silverado’s cabin is just as varied. On one end, you’re looking at a very basic work truck with vinyl seats, manual door locks, and crank windows. In reality, few buyers outside of fleets will have this kind of Silverado. On the other end, a High Country model will treat you to leather upholstery, heated and cooled seats, and premium amenities.
Seating ranges from a 3-person bench to the more comfortable 5-passenger setup. All Silverados come with a touchscreen display, either 7 inches or 8 inches in size. Lower trims are stuck with a tilt-only steering wheel and only 4-way adjustable seats. This combination makes it harder to find the perfect driving position. LT and higher trims have tilt and telescoping steering wheel and 10-way power-adjust seats.
Chevrolet’s interior treatment still can’t match the features of some of its rivals, such as the 12-inch touchscreen display in the Ram 1500 or the massaging seats and audiophile sound system of a high-end Ford F-150.
Exterior StylingContinuing the Silverado’s many-things-to-many-people theme, it can be had in several configurations. Those simply using this truck for work have the choice of a regular cab and long bed (box length of 98.18 inches), double cab with standard bed (79.44 inches), or crew cab with standard or short bed (69.92 inches).
Even more variety and customization awaits in trims and packages. Aggressive black-out tones can be had with Midnight Edition models, there’s chrome galore on others, and even a camouflage motif on the limited Realtree edition.
The Silverado Trail Boss variants sit higher thanks to a lifted suspension.
As we mentioned in Favorite Features, a new feature for 2021 is the Multi-Flex tailgate, Chevy’s version of the GMC Sierra’s MultiPro tailgate. It will be available in early 2021 on all models.
Favorite FeaturesTOWING TECH
The Silverado’s multi-camera towing system really must be seen to be believed. And even then, you may not believe it. Up to 15 camera views allow you to see what’s behind a trailer, and even what’s inside your trailer to monitor cargo or animal. A particularly cool mode is the “invisible trailer” that melds views to give the perspective of seeing through your trailer.
MULTI-FLEX TAILGATE
For 2021, the Chevrolet Silverado finally gets a feature that so far had been exclusive to its GMC Sierra sibling. The Multi-Flex tailgate offers half a dozen positions, including a standing workstation and step ladder. It is to be available in early 2021 on all models.
Standard FeaturesAt its most basic, the 2021 Silverado Work Truck has a 4.3-liter V6, 6-speed automatic transmission, 4-wheel disc brakes, and 17-inch painted steel wheels. Buyers can choose either a vinyl or cloth 40/20/40-split/fold bench seat. If you need more proof of its bare-bones nature, this truck still has manual windows and door locks. There is, however, a 7-inch touchscreen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.
The beds come with 12 cargo tie-downs, while the rear bumpers have CornerSteps. Buyers can then add more equipment and different drivetrains by ascending the trim levels.
Most buyers will be happier in a higher trim. Just stepping up to a Custom, for example, gets you cruise control, power windows/door locks, and 20-inch wheels. For 2021, Custom and Custom Trail Boss models include the Custom Convenience and Infotainment packages that include EZ Lift power lock and release tailgate, LED bed lighting, remote start, and more.
Highlights of the Silverado LT model include chrome bumpers and mirror caps, GM’s OnStar connected services, semi-automatic single-zone climate control, and the availability of more options, including powertrains.
The street-style RST trims have black accents, LED fog lights and taillights, keyless open and start, and rear-window defogger.
Silverado LTZ trims have even nicer features, including 10-way power-adjust driver’s seat with memory setting, dual-zone climate control, leather interior, 8-inch touchscreen display, wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, heated seats and steering wheel, a high-def rearview camera with hitch guidance, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, heated side mirrors, plus integrated trailer brake controller, 120-volt power outlets, automatic locking rear differential.
Top-line Silverado High Country models include heated/ventilated front seats, 20-inch wheels, chrome assist steps, spray-on bedliner, high-intensity headlights, power-operated tailgate, 8-inch touchscreen display with navigation, and Bose premium audio.
Factory OptionsAll models of the Silverado are available with 4-wheel drive (4WD) in lieu of the standard rear-wheel drive (RWD), with 4WD standard on the off-road-oriented Trail Boss models.
Several engines are also available, including the 6.2-liter V8 and inline-6 turbodiesel. Amenities like power driver’s seat and keyless entry with push-button start that are standard on higher trims are optional on lower ones. The Z51 off-road package includes an automatic locking rear differential and hill-descent control.
The Safety Package that’s standard on LTZ trims and optional on LT and RST models includes blind-spot monitoring and parking sensors. A new and recommendable package for Work Truck and Custom models is the Safety Confidence package that includes forward-collision alert with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking.
LTZ and High Country trims can be further enhanced with the Safety Package II that adds lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and IntelliBeam automatic high-beam headlights. Newly available at the High Country trim level is Adaptive Ride Control, a sophisticated and fast-reacting suspension system.
Then there are various special edition packages such as the Texas Edition. Additional options worth considering are navigation, Bose premium audio, wireless phone charger, the advanced trailering camera system, plus the slick Rearview Mirror Camera that turns the inside mirror into a digital display.
Engine & TransmissionSeveral engines are available for the Chevrolet Silverado, providing a powertrain for a variety of tastes.
The base engine is a 4.3-liter V6, with a 5.3-liter V8 available in some variants (linked to a 6-, 8- or 10-speed automatic transmission), and a turbocharged 2.7-liter 4-cylinder unit offered in others. The top engine is a 6.2-liter V8, which is now standard in the LT Trail Boss and optional in the High Country. Also available is a powerful yet efficient turbodiesel inline-6. It packs a lot of torque – 460 lb-ft – and fuel economy of up to 33 mpg.
Towing capacities have been enhanced for 2021. The turbo 4-cylinder is now rated to tow 9,600 pounds when configured as a regular cab/long box or 9,300 pounds with crew cab and short box. The 3.0-liter Duramax turbodiesel now has a max of 9,500 pounds.
With the 6.2-liter, a Silverado is rated to tow up to 13,300 pounds. As with most other new vehicles, many Silverado models use a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle to save fuel. The system can be disabled with the press of a button.

Multi-Flex tailgate arrives in early 2021
Enhanced camera trailering features
Wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto
Enhanced towing capability
Active safety features available on lower trims

The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado is a versatile and recommendable full-size pickup. As with its best-selling archrival, the Ford F-150, plus the Ram 1500 and the GMC Sierra, the Chevy Silverado half-ton truck is available in a dizzying variety of configurations. Engine choices range from a turbocharged 4-cylinder to a rumbling 6.2-liter V8, with GM’s venerable 5.3-liter V8 and a just-adequate V6 also in the mix. The recent arrival of a turbodiesel 6-cylinder makes the Silverado even more tempting.
With an all-new Ford F-150 around the corner, the Silverado continues to up its game. Improvements for 2021 include a multi-function tailgate like the one that’s been available on the GMC Sierra, enhanced towing capacity, upgraded tech like wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and Adaptive Ride Control suspension on top-line models.
In addition to the ability to tow over 13,000 pounds, the Silverado stands out for its advanced multi-camera trailering system that makes hooking up trailers and towing less them less stressful.

Driving the  2021 Nissan SentraIn the big picture, 149 horsepower is not a massive amount of muscle, but it’s kind of respectable here. Although the Honda Civic and Mazda3, both more engaging machines for a driver, are gutsier.
Delivery of that power is at least pleasantly responsive to throttle inputs. And, at the other end of the performance envelope, the brakes (especially the top two trims with discs at each corner) are effective and feel confident. The steering is equally agreeable, with a well-judged weight and feel.
Not so long ago, a continuously variable transmission (CVT) would have sent shivers of dread down the spines of even merely casual driving enthusiasts. To Nissan’s credit, the company has engineered this unloved apparatus into something almost engaging, eliminating the rubber-band feel that used to come with the CVT territory, simulating actual gears, and suppressing the typical drone except for under hard acceleration.
Even more impressive, this newest Sentra has an independent multi-link rear suspension, which is a more sophisticated and higher-end setup than the torsion beams in some rivals like the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. Ride and handling are improved even further by two standard electronic systems.
Both apply subtle braking to individual wheels as conditions dictate. Active Ride Control combats the up/down pitching motion that can occur over washboard-like road surfaces. And Intelligent Trace Control keeps the Sentra’s cornering lines tight and precise. Overall, the 2021 Sentra feels balanced, stable, and nimble.
Interior ComfortNissan makes a big deal of the Zero Gravity front seats in many of its vehicles and always seems to mention NASA in the same breath. They weren’t designed by NASA, however. The smaller print says the design of these seats was inspired by zero-gravity travel. All that aside, they are extremely comfortable, not just for the class.
The rest of the 2021 Sentra cabin is not exactly rocket-ship cool, but it does have a cockpit kind of feel. The SV can be ordered with quilted leather upholstery and has a leather-wrapped steering wheel as standard, which is so much nicer than the bare plastic version in the S. The wheel is also D-shaped, a sporting touch that makes it easier for drivers to slide their knees under.
Interior space is adequate for a compact sedan, but rear legroom of 34.7 inches is not as good as the Civic or Corolla. There are 60/40 split/folding rear seats for some cargo flexibility over the trunk’s 14.3 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingFollowing its redesign last year, the Nissan Sentra now looks just as well-executed as its larger Altima and Maxima stablemates, all with the V-grille corporate signature.
The “floating roof” effect is also used here, where the rear pillars have a blacked-out section. This year, the top SR trim becomes eligible for a new 2-tone color scheme of Electric Blue Metallic with a black roof.
The base S trim runs on 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers, the SV has 16-inch alloys, and the SR is fitted with 18-inch alloy wheels. It also has black side mirror housings and a dark chrome grille.
Favorite FeaturesEXTERIOR STYLING
The 2021 Sentra’s exterior design echoes Nissan’s larger sedans, making this compact car appear more expensive than it really is. Looks are subjective, but it’s easy to imagine a new Sentra being popular with many people.
SAFETY SHIELD 360
Nissan’s comprehensive set of safety features is standard throughout the range, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, and automatic on/off headlights with automatic high beams.
Standard FeaturesThe most impressive aspect of the standard equipment in the 2021 Sentra S trim is Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 safety systems (see Favorite Features). The least impressive might be that instead of disc brakes at the rear (like the SV and SR trims), this entry-level version has drums.
The S does at least gain Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration this year. And there are some other cool items, such as keyless entry/ignition, driver attention monitoring, a flat-bottomed steering wheel, and Intelligent Trace Control that applies subtle braking to certain wheels so the car can steer around corners more effectively. In the tech department, a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen and a 4.2-inch digital driver information display are also standard.
Despite all these features, the next-up SV trim is still a better choice, bringing an 8-inch infotainment display, 7-inch digital driver’s display, leather-wrapped steering wheel, three USB ports, satellite radio, automatic high beams, and intelligent cruise control.
Factory OptionsThe top SR trim has 18-inch alloy wheels (which may not be the best choice from a ride quality point of view), LED headlights, and some cosmetic additions. But the main reason for buying this model could be to access the optional features in the SR Premium package that includes a powered moonroof, heated front seats/steering wheel, simulated leather upholstery, 360-degree camera system, Wi-Fi, and an 8-speaker Bose audio system.
There’s also a Premium package for the SV trim that isn’t quite as feature-packed, although it does bring diamond-stitched leather upholstery.
Engine & TransmissionA naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine propels the 2021 Sentra with 149 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. This modest amount of energy goes through a continuously variable transmission (CVT) to the front wheels.
The lower two trims average around 33 miles per gallon. The top SR model manages 32 mpg.

The 2021 Nissan Sentra is a really good compact sedan. It has to be, because even though the world is crossover-crazy, companies are still making and selling excellent examples of the compact car craft. The Sentra, now in the second year of its eighth generation, holds its own among them.
Over those generations, this car has been one of Nissan’s top sellers. So when the time became ripe for a new Sentra, it made sense to give it the top treatment. This entailed smart designs inside and out, engineering a refined ride, and adding value to the base model with things like smartphone integration and a comprehensive array of driver assistance features.
Those standard features help to offset prices and fuel economy figures that are merely average for the class.

There’s a choice of two gasoline engines, a hybrid model (reviewed separately) that attains up to 53 mpg, and even the option of a manual transmission for driving enthusiasts. Bolstering the lineup’s fun-to-drive factor is the new Corolla Apex, a limited edition with upgraded suspension, handling, and aesthetics. The Corolla is also available as a hatchback, also reviewed separately.

 2021 Toyota Corolla PricingThe 2021 Toyota Corolla has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $19,825 for the L trim, plus destination fee. We’d suggest at least a Corolla LE, which is still a terrific value. On the other end of the Corolla spectrum, the XSE starts at $25,550 and can reach just under $29,000 with options.
At these prices, the Corolla begins just under the Honda Civic and slightly above the Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra, and Volkswagen Jetta. The Mazda3, which strives for more of a premium feel in this segment, starts higher than the Corolla. The Kia Forte marks its value proposition with a starting price of around $18,000. The Subaru Impreza, which has all-wheel drive standard, also has an appealing price starting under $19,000.
Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Toyota Corolla’s resale value has always been impressive and should remain near the top of the class.

Driving the  2021 Toyota CorollaThe competence of the Toyota Corolla’s new platform shines in its driving experience. This compact car is solid, quiet, and offers a comfortable ride without backing down when pushed. The steering is crisp yet tends a touch toward the light side, making it easy to wheel about.
Toyota has refined its continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to take some of the elasticity out of its response. Most drivers won’t be aware of its presence and those who do notice, probably would be better suited to the manual version to more effectively exploit the Corolla’s independent suspension.
The 139-horsepower 1.8-liter engine in L, LE, and XLE trims is acceptable for everyday duties, but the SE and XSE models are more rewarding thanks to their 2.0-liter engine with 169 horsepower. In addition to having 30 more horses under the hood, they employ a special CVT that uses a mechanical first gear. The result is a CVT that feels less like a CVT.
Interior ComfortToyota describes the Corolla’s interior design philosophy as “sensuous minimalism.” The layout is clean and horizontal with few lines, and the dash dominated by an infotainment touch screen (7-inch diagonal on the L trim, 8-inch on all other models) that sprouts from the center of the dash.
The screen is flanked by physical buttons, volume and tuner knobs beneath and a climate-control system below. The instrument cluster is also digital with a standard 4.2-inch display, while a 7-inch configurable layout comes on higher-trim levels. Soft-touch materials cover all the upper surfaces, and on the SE and XSE, the front bucket seats are more contoured to provide additional support.
Cloth upholstery is standard and can be upgraded to a SofTex leatherette. The cabin has a light, airy feel to it along with materials and a level of fit and finish you’d expect in a more premium vehicle.
Exterior StylingLike the cabin, this latest Toyota Corolla has a contemporary look with a front end dominated by a large trapezoidal mesh grille. The headlight units feature LED daytime running lights with two or three elements per side, depending on the trim level. The Corolla’s profile is clean, with a soft character line rising from the front wheel arch through the rear deck.
From the back, the taillights are connected by a single strip running across the decklid, and on Sport models, the rear diffuser accentuates the car’s wider stance. While the front end shares a family resemblance to the redesigned Camry and Avalon, the overall shape and look of the Corolla are more on the understated 4-door side of the ledger than a flashy, Euro-inspired sports sedan.
The sport Corolla SE grades have more aggressive elements like smoked rear light housings and dark gray metallic front grille. The new limited-edition Corolla Apex model takes this further with its own distinct treatments.
Favorite FeaturesSPORT TRIM
No one will confuse a Corolla for a Subaru WRX; however, if you like to shift for yourself and experience the nimbleness of the independent rear suspension, the Sport trim level with the 6-speed manual transplants the fun factor from the Corolla Hatchback into the sedan. SE models with an auto transmission get the special CVT (see driving impressions) and a Sport mode.
Standard FeaturesThe Corolla comes in several trims: L, LE, XLE, SE, and XSE. Starting with the L trim, the Corolla includes LED headlights, 15-inch steel wheels, 6-way adjustable driver’s seat, and a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa, and new for 2021, Android Auto support. Significantly, all new Corolla models come with the Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 suite of assists. This includes a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams, radar cruise control (with a stop-and-go feature on CVT models), Road Sign Assist and Lane Tracing Assist that helps to keep the vehicle centered in its lane. All new Toyotas also include two years/25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.
Factory OptionsFor just $450 more, we recommend stepping up to at least a Corolla LE. That bit of money buys a better-equipped Corolla with an 8-inch touchscreen display, 16-inch wheels, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, premium fabric. It also has a rear-seat armrest with cupholders – a small detail that’s a big deal if you regularly have rear passengers or use the car for ride-sharing.
Corolla SE models have the more powerful engine, available manual transmission, and sporty features like 18-inch wheels, paddle shifters (on CVT models), and sport driving mode.
XLE and XSE trims add amenities like a power moonroof, power-adjust driver’s seat, alloy wheels, JBL premium audio, 7-inch digital instrument cluster, and heated front seats and SofTex faux leather. Those models also include blind-spot monitoring, now with rear cross-traffic alert for 2021.
Options vary by trim but include blind-spot monitoring, navigation, premium audio, wireless phone charger, and adaptive front lighting.
Engine & TransmissionThe Toyota Corolla comes with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder in L, LE, and LXE trims. This engine makes 139 horsepower and mates to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). SE and XSE trims use a 2.0-liter engine that makes 169 horsepower and offers a choice of a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT with a mechanical 1st gear. New for 2021, the Corolla features a fuel-saving engine shut-off that can be disabled by the driver. All Corolla models are front-wheel drive.

Driving the  2021 Honda OdysseyBy its very nature, a minivan is large and does not prioritize sleek aerodynamics. That’s OK, customers are prepared for the trade-off when there’s so much practicality in return. However, the 2021 Odyssey is at least as responsive and controlled as many SUV/crossovers. It’s not particularly thrilling, but it’s not a chore either.
The only dynamic update for 2021 is a new electric brake booster that, beyond enabling low-speed adaptive cruise control abilities, also delivers improved brake pedal feel. The standard-issue 3.5-liter V6 still pulls strongly, sweetly, and almost silently. The 10-speed automatic transmission executes virtually imperceptible shifts. The drivetrain remains relaxed at freeway speeds, returning 28 mpg on the highway.
On all roads, the ride is simultaneously smooth and confident (with the 18-inch wheel/tire combination, at least), contributing to the Odyssey’s refined air. Other attributes include a hushed interior, plenty of room in all three rows, and some of the most advanced driver assistance systems offered in a minivan.
Interior ComfortAmong the upgrades for 2021, the Honda Odyssey now has 2nd-row seats that fold flat, making them easier to remove. Controls for the climate system have also been revised, while Honda now offers a rear-seat reminder feature. This latter item can work in tandem with the CabinWatch camera in the top two trims, which is an industry first. The first and second row of the Elite model are now covered in perforated leather.
There are many other practical features and technologies, and the 2021 Odyssey enjoys a high degree of fit and finish that transcends the typical soccer shuttle. All the requisite cup holders and cubbies are present, and the quality of materials is high. A large center console between the front seats is perfect for a wide variety of items like maps, tissues, baby wipes or even a pair of binoculars that might come in handy on the next road trip.
The dash (in all but the entry-level LX) features a digital gauge cluster and an 8-inch touchscreen. And all models from the EX up have Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration as standard.
The entry-level LX is a 7-seater; all other Odysseys seat eight. Two adults and a child can fit in the third row, which folds into the floor. Cargo space runs from 32.8 to 158 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingStyling revisions for 2021 keep the Honda Odyssey looking fresh. The grille has been tweaked and is now flanked by LED headlights in all trims. The tail end has also received a little attention.
The base LX trim comes with 18-inch alloy wheels and rear privacy glass. The top Elite version has redesigned 19-inch alloy wheels and self-dimming side mirrors.
Favorite FeaturesMAGIC SLIDE SEATS
For added convenience, the Odyssey’s 2nd-row seats slide forward and back or side to side. This allows siblings to sit in one row while keeping a convenient central path to access the rearmost row. For improved access to an infant in a child safety seat, the center seat can be moved all the way forward.
HONDAVAC
The onboard vacuum in the 2021 Odyssey remains as convenient as ever. Available as standard equipment in the Elite trim, the HondaVac makes quick work of spilled Cheerios or Goldfish crackers.
Standard FeaturesAs well as those LED headlights, the revamped 2021 Odyssey also gains the Honda Sensing array of safety features as standard throughout the range. This now includes adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, forward collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and lane-keeping assistance.
Every version has a 3.5-liter V6 engine connected to a 10-speed automatic transmission, push-button ignition, power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, and rear privacy glass. The Odyssey EX (and above) provides accommodation for eight, Magic Slide 2nd-row seats, power-sliding side doors, and an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system.
Factory OptionsHonda prefers its customers to obtain more equipment by moving up to higher trim levels rather than make option packages available. Many buyers will appreciate a powered tailgate, which comes in the EX-L model and also has leather seating surfaces.
Front and rear parking sensors, navigation, CabinWatch and CabinTalk (to help you keep your eyes and ears on your kids), 3rd-row USB port and sunshades, plus wireless hotspot capability all come in at the Touring level. The range-topping Elite gets heated and ventilated front seats, HondaVAC onboard vacuum cleaner,  rain-sensing wipers, heated steering wheel, ambient LED cabin lighting, perforated leather, wireless charging, a better audio system, a hands-free power tailgate, and bigger wheels.
Engine & TransmissionNo need to agonize over engine choices, the 2021 Odyssey comes solely with a 3.5-liter V6 sending 280 horsepower to the front wheels through a 10-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel. This setup runs just fine on 87-octane regular gasoline. An engine stop/start feature when idling and automatic cylinder deactivation (shutting off three cylinders under light load) help to save some fuel.

Advanced safety features now standard throughout the range

The 2021 Honda Odyssey continues the winning ways of the best-selling minivan in the United States. During its lifetime where more than 1.1 million have found homes on American driveways, the Odyssey has become a Kelley Blue Book favorite, winning our Minivan Best Buy award in 2018, 2019 and 2020, Best Resale Value award in 2020, plus a 5-Year Cost to Own Award and Best Family Car award in 2019. The Honda Odyssey provides family transport for up to eight occupants that’s user-friendly, well thought out, and with a certain class.
It has a smartly functional interior and comes standard with many modern safety features. Although a Dodge Grand Caravan costs less, it doesn’t offer the same protections. The Chrysler Pacifica and Toyota Sienna have similar space and power. But the Odyssey’s ability to get so many minivan aspects right, including resale values, gives it a definite edge.

Driving the  2021 Nissan RogueThe Nissan Rogue has always stood out for its comfortable and quiet ride quality, and those traits have only improved with this all-new model. The all-new 2021 Nissan Rogue is its best driving to date and is especially impressive if you prioritize plushness as much as you do practicality. Yet Nissan has also enabled the Rogue to feel a bit more athletic, aided by a multilink rear suspension. It doesn’t exactly beg to be thrown into corners, but the new Rogue will tolerate such enthusiasm.
Like past Nissan Rogue models, power is competent enough. Driver-selectable modes change the behavior of the powertrain, but you’ll probably do best to leave it in Normal or Sport. The Eco mode mutes throttle response notably.
Nissan vehicles have long used continuously variable transmissions (CVT), a type of automatic with no set gears, and the Rogue is no exception. The Rogue’s latest CVT only makes itself known as one under hard acceleration, in which it can drone. Otherwise, it’s a smooth operator that does a fine job mimicking a traditional automatic.
Another plus is the driver’s seat. Here again, Nissan prides itself on its “Zero Gravity” seats, and the latest version in this new Rogue proved comfortable even over hours of driving covering hundreds of miles.
Nissan’s ProPilot semi-autonomous driving also continues to evolve. Its adaptive cruise control with steering assist proved helpful in heavy freeway traffic, where it made sitting in stop-and-go scenarios less stressful. For 2021, the system can also use data from the navigation system to take proactive measures, such as adjusting speed for a curve or freeway exit. It can also hold for stopped traffic for up to 30 seconds.
Interior ComfortNissan spent much effort improving the Rogue interior. The company continues to use NASA-inspired Zero Gravity seats that are a good blend of comfort and support, and the front seats offer a bit more travel. In back, the 2021 Rogue sees small increases in knee room and headroom.
What’s more, the new center console has a butterfly-style lid, and a move to an electronic-style gear selector has created space for a handy cubby directly below. Large 32-ounce bottles can fit in each of the 2021 Rogue’s four door pockets, and the rear doors now open almost 90 degrees to aid ingress and egress while making it easier to install a baby seat.
In back, the Rogue’s cargo area has a slightly wider and taller opening, and the capacity behind the rear seat has increased from 32 cubic feet to 36.5. With the seat folded, the cargo capacity has grown from 70 cubic feet in the previous Rogue to 74.1 in the new one.
The new top model, the 2021 Nissan Rogue Platinum, distinguishes itself with digital gauges and beautiful semi-aniline interior leather with quilted diamond-pattern stitching.
There was also a great effort to make the Rogue quieter inside. Efforts toward that end were spearheaded by thicker insulation for the engine, plus better isolation for the new multilink rear suspension. The stiffer chassis and reshaped A-pillars also help to reduce wind and road noise, along with new acoustic front glass.
Exterior StylingWe like the blocky new look of the 2021 Nissan Rogue, styled at the company’s design center in Japan. It’s rugged but refined, with Nissan’s trademark V-Motion grille and a “floating” roof.
Although it’s a more upright design, the new Rogue is slightly more aerodynamic than before. Its coefficient of drag has been improved by five percent, thanks in part to active grille shutters, front air curtains, and underbody covers.
The new Rogue’s LED headlights, for the record, are not those thin slits up high on the nose of the vehicle. Those are the running lights, which also incorporate the turn signals. The Rogue’s headlights are just below the running lights but above the fog lamps.
Favorite Features12.3-INCH DIGITAL DASHBOARD
In the spot where most vehicles have traditional analog gauges, the new 2021 Nissan Rogue Platinum model features a large 12.3 -inch digital dashboard. Highly configurable and dazzlingly clear, the color display features a large central section that displays the vitals for the Rogue’s semi-autonomous ProPilot driver-assist program.
VEHICLE MOTION CONTROL
With this new technology, the 2021 Nissan Rogue predicts what the driver is trying to do by monitoring the steering, accelerator, and brakes, and then makes that happen. For instance, if the Rogue isn’t turning as sharply as the driver wants, Vehicle Motion Control will apply the brakes to a single inside wheel to help tighten the cornering line.
Standard FeaturesAt the base level, the 2021 Nissan Rogue S gets LED headlights and taillights, 17-inch alloy wheels, the Safety Shield 360 safety suite, and an 8-inch display screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
The Rogue SV, the expected volume model, comes with ProPilot Assist, 18-inch alloy wheels, NissanConnect, and an 8-way power driver seat with power lumbar.
Leather interior trim and 19-inch alloy wheels are standard on the 2021 Nissan Rogue SL, joined by a panoramic moonroof, a motion-activated liftgate, tri-zone climate control, a power front passenger seat, and memory for the driver’s seat and steering wheel position.
At the top of the 2021 lineup is the Rogue Platinum. This new Rogue model comes with a 12.3-inch digital gauge package, a 10.8-inch head-up display, and seats upholstered with a diamond-quilted semi-aniline leather. The Rogue Platinum also gets wireless Apple CarPlay (late availability), plus wireless smartphone charging, and a premium Bose audio system. The Platinum’s ProPilot Assist with Navi-link can adjust the Rogue’s speed based on map data, such as an upcoming bend in the highway.
Factory OptionsA Premium Package is available on the SV, the Rogue’s expected volume leader. It includes a panoramic moonroof, leatherette seating, a hand’s free power liftgate, and roof rails.
The 2021 Nissan Rogue SL also is available with a Premium Package, but one that includes different features. It consists of an upgraded Bose stereo, navigation with a 9-inch center display, and ProPilot Assist with Navi-link. This last item represents a substantive improvement to ProPilot, as it allows the system to communicate with the nav system and slow the Rogue if necessary for upcoming bends in the road or if you’ve pulled into an exit lane while preparing to leave the highway.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2021 Nissan Rogue is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder. Massaged a bit for 2021 with mirror bore coating and a variable-displacement oil pump, it now puts out 181 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 181 lb-ft of torque at 3,600 rpm. Last year, the aluminum block 4-cylinder was good for 170 hp at 6,000 rpm and 175 lb-ft of torque at 4,400 rpm.
While the idea of more torque at lower rpm always appeals to us, we’re also pleased to see that EPA fuel economy has improved. A front-drive 2020 Nissan Rogue was rated at 26 mpg city/33 mpg highway/29 mpg combined. A front-drive new 2021 Nissan Rogue is estimated to earn up to 27 mpg city/35 mpg highway.
With AWD, the 2020 Rogue achieves 25 mpg city/32 mpg highway/27 mpg combined. An AWD 2021 Nissan Rogue is estimated at up to 26 mpg city/33 mpg highway/29 mpg combined
The key takeaway here: The new 2021 Nissan Rogue has a bit more power and a bit more efficiency.
A second available engine that’s being tried in a “small pilot program” according to Nissan is a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-3 engine. We don’t have the performance numbers at this time, but we do have official fuel economy ratings from the EPA. It makes the Rogue more efficient returning 30 mpg city/37 mpg highway/33 mpg combined with FWD. Upgrading to AWD results in a slight drop in efficiency at 30 mpg city/36 mpg highway/33 mpg combined.

The Rogue is an incredibly important vehicle for Nissan. It’s Nissan North America’s best-selling model, and it competes in the hyper-competitive compact crossover SUV segment with the likes of the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, and Ford Escape. For this reason, a tremendous amount of development has gone into crafting this all-new 2021 Nissan Rogue. It benefits from a stiffer structure, added safety systems, a bit more power, and improved technology. It goes on sale in the fall of 2020
All it takes is one look to see that the 2021 Nissan Rogue is an all-new vehicle, about the same size as before but with blocky, more expressive styling that draws inspiration from the X-Motion Concept shown in Detroit in 2018. It has an upright grille and a floating roof, and the flatter hood, along with the front fenders and door skins, is made of aluminum to save weight.
A 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is the sole available powerplant, and Nissan says it has massaged the engine to put out 181 horsepower, an improvement of 10 percent. Peak torque has been upped by 3 percent to 181 lb-ft. That power goes to the wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) tweaked for better acceleration and fuel economy. Front-wheel-drive (FWD) and all-wheel-drive (AWD) models will continue to be available, the latter benefitting from a central hydraulic clutch that sends power more quickly to the rear wheels when needed.
All 2021 Rogues fitted with AWD have five different driver-selectable terrain modes: Standard, Eco, Sport, Off-road, and Snow.

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. The starter and alternator functions are combined into one unit, and the engine is equipped with an Auto Stop/Start feature. The hybrid can travel on pure electric power for short distances at speeds below 25 mph.

Models equipped with navigation now feature the Aha infotainment app.
If there is one thing Subaru owners love about their vehicles it is ground clearance. So, when Subaru decided to make a new SUV from its popular Impreza hatchback, they started by raising it to a whopping 8.7 inches.

No hybrid Altima
Not as upscale as Mazda6
Only transmission is a CVT",30000,"The 2021 Nissan Altima competes in the hyper-competitive midsize-sedan class against the likes of the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5, and Mazda6. Fine rides, all, but only the Camry and Kia offer the option of all-wheel drive like the Altima does.
The U.S.-built Altima is in its third year, and it’s blessed with particularly comfortable front seats, excellent safety features, and precise-yet-pliant dynamics. The exterior styling of this 5-seat Nissan sedan still looks fresh, and the car four adults can ride comfortably to dinner in the Altima (remember when we used to do that?). What’s more, the efficiency of the .5-liter Altima is excellent, aided by a continuously variable automatic transmission that’s not our favorite but keeps getting better with each passing year.
 2021 Nissan Altima PricingAt $24,300, the front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2021 Nissan Altima S is the least expensive version you can buy. The much-better-equipped 2021 Nissan Altima 2.5 SV has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $25,400. With all-wheel drive (AWD), the Altima SV starts at $26,800, an increase of only $1,400. Like all other 2021 Nissan Altimas, these three models are subject to a destination charge of $925.
The 2021 Nissan Altima SR, equipped with the standard 188-horsepower 2.5-liter engine and sport suspension, costs $26,200 in FWD form or $27,600 with AWD. Equipped with the 236-horsepower variable-compression engine, the 2021 Nissan Altima SR 2.0 starts at $30,650. Unfortunately, an AWD Altima equipped with the VC-Turbo engine is not available.
Luxuriously appointed Altima SL models, which have standard leather upholstery, begin at $29,990 in FWD form and $31,390 with AWD.
The most opulent 2021 Nissan Altima, the Platinum – equipped with AWD, 19-inch alloy wheels, and a handy 360-degree exterior monitor – starts at $34,100.
At these prices, the 2021 Nissan Altima competes well with the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Mazda6, but the Hyundai Sonata and Kia K5 have a slightly lower MSRP. Also worth noting: The least expensive AWD Altima starts at $26,800 while the AWD 2021 Subaru Legacy, at $22,895, is the least-expensive midsize AWD sedan available in the U.S.

Driving the  2021 Nissan AltimaThe Altima’s seats are all-day comfortable, arguably the best available in a mass-market mainstream midsize sedan. They’re comfortable and supportive, with good bolstering for cornering support.
The base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is quiet and adequately powered for around-town duty. When the Altima is driven in a normal fashion, its CVT simulates the shifts of a conventional automatic, so it feels familiar. But with more aggressive throttle usage, the CVT causes the powertrain “motorboat” a bit, that odd sensation when engine rpm feels unrelated to vehicle speed.
The turbocharged variable-compression 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine in the SR models is a true technical marvel. It’s flexible in its power delivery, if a bit coarser than the 2.5, and its 236 horsepower is put to good use via a sport-tuned chassis with shift paddles on the steering column.
Interior ComfortWith the Altima, Nissan’s interior designers opted for simplicity and functionality over theater. It’s a pleasant interior, and the standard 8-inch touchscreen provides easy access to Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration. Moreover, the climate controls are convenient, and USB and USB-C ports are found front and rear.
Occupant space inside the Altima is about average, not as roomy as a Honda Accord. Similarly, the rear legroom of the Altima is a bit less generous than that of many rivals. Trunk space, at 15.4 cubic feet, is similar to that of the Toyota Camry. The view out the rearview mirror is a bit pinched by the high rear deck.
Exterior StylingNow in its third year of production, the Altima continues to look fresh. Highlights of the design include the big, bold “V” grille and the “floating-roof” rear roof pillars. The sporty Altima SR is distinguished by a dark chrome grille, LED headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, black side-mirror housings, and body-color door handles.
Favorite FeaturesVC-T ENGINE
VC stands for “variable compression,” and T stands for “turbocharged.” This turbo 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is an engineering feat, automatically switching to a lower compression when turbo boost is needed and changing to a higher compression for improved fuel economy on the highway. The VC-T doesn’t quite offer the fuel economy of a 4-cylinder with the power of a V6, but that’s the idea behind this technically fascinating engine.
SAFETY FEATURES
Behind the banners of Safety Shield 360 and ProPilot Assist lies an array of driver aids such as rear automatic braking, lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-centering/adaptive cruise control technology. But even the entry-level S trim has forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking and, new for 2021, pedestrian protection.
Standard FeaturesThe 2021 Nissan Altima S has cloth upholstery and 16-inch steel wheels, plus 16-inch steel wheels, a tilt/telescope steering wheel, pushbutton ignition, cruise control, a 7-inch touchscreen, and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.
The Altima SV has 17-inch alloy wheels and an 8-way power driver’s seat, along with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, an 8-inch color display, LED headlamps, and a safety suite with a blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, rear automatic braking, and rear parking beeper.
You get a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch alloy wheels on the Altima SR, plus paddle shifters, sport seats, and a leather-covered steering wheel. If you order the SR with the VC-Turbo engine, it comes with a single-panel moonroof, heated front seats, and heated outside mirrors with LED turn signals.
Next up, the Altima SL, which is loaded with standard equipment. SL highlights include leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, and navigation system, along with a Bose audio system with nine speakers, acoustic front door glass, heated seats, a heated steering wheel, and Pro Pilot Assist, which features active cruise control with steering assistance.
Capping the lineup is the Altima Platinum, a leather-clad AWD model with 19-inch alloy wheels, a 360-degree monitor, interior accent lighting, and memory for the driver’s seat.
Factory OptionsOn the Altima S, a new Driver Assist Package is available. A bargain at $475, this package includes a blind-spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert, plus automatic rear braking, a back-up sonar beeper, and an 8-way power driver’s seat.
The $1,800 SV Premium Package comes with a moonroof, LED turn indicators (in the rearview mirrors), heated front seats, a leather-covered steering wheel, and shift knob. The package also includes ProPilot Assist with Steering Assist, adaptive cruise control, and an electronic parking brake.
Similarly, the SR Premium Package ($1,200) features a moonroof and LED turn indicators, along with heated front seats and 2-way driver lumbar support.
Stand-alone options on the 2021 Nisan Altima include premium paint, splash guards, a rear spoiler (not available on the S), and 17-inch alloy wheels (on the S, SV, and SL).
Engine & TransmissionAlmost all 2021 Nissan Altimas are powered by the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 188 horsepower. This is the only Altima engine that can be paired with AWD.
Only one 2021 Nissan Altima, the 2.0 SR, is equipped with the turbocharged variable-compression 2.0-liter engine. This FWD Altima, with 248 horsepower, is quick.
Both engines are linked to a CVT, which is good for fuel economy but robs this midsize Nissan sedan of any serious sporting pretensions. Our suggestion: Put the shifter in D and forget about it.

Unless you want a very basic family SUV without the active safety features easily found standard on rivals, plan on spending closer to $40,000. On the other end of the Traverse spectrum, a loaded all-wheel-drive High Country model can reach nearly $59,000.
At its starting price, a new Chevy Traverse slightly undercuts rivals, but not by much. A Honda Pilot starts around $32,000 and includes a wealth of active safety features not available on lower Traverse models. The story is the same for the Ford Explorer, Kia Telluride, and Hyundai Palisade.
Subaru’s Ascent, which includes active safety systems and standard all-wheel drive, also starts around $32,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new SUV. The Chevy Traverse’s resale value is expected to be about average, still trailing better rivals like the Highlander, Ascent, and Pilot.

Driving the  2021 Chevrolet TraverseWhether you’re dropping the kids at soccer, commuting to work, or ferrying family on a road trip, the Chevrolet Traverse is quite capable. Like nearly every other 3-row crossover SUV except for maybe the Mazda CX-9 or Ford Explorer ST, the Traverse isn’t very spry. Nor will you experience a whoosh of acceleration. But that isn’t the point in such a family SUV. Playing the role of family hauler, the 2021 Traverse is comfortable, quiet, and roomy enough to keep cranky kids at arm’s length.
The Traverse’s standard V6 engine has good power and works well with the standard 9-speed automatic transmission. It is also rated to tow up to 5,000 pounds, similar to competitors like the Kia Telluride.
One of our biggest gripes pertains to when the Traverse is stopped. Like other new vehicles, it uses a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle to save fuel. Unlike other vehicles, you can’t switch that start/stop function off. That can mean an irritating situation where the engine is constantly starting and stopping in instances like heavy traffic. Try before you buy — especially at several stoplights.
Interior ComfortClass-leading interior space is one of the Traverse’s best traits and a reason it’s popular with growing families. All Traverse models have three rows of seats. If you go with the standard 2nd-row bench, there is seating for eight passengers. If you choose the more comfortable twin captain’s seats in the middle row, there’s room for seven. The last row is best suited for kids. Up front, the driver and passenger seats do well at accommodating a variety of body shapes.
The central infotainment touchscreen comes in a standard 7-inch size or an optional 8-inch version. Both are easy to use, similar to a large mobile phone. In addition to touch operation, there are physical controls for common functions like volume and audio-track adjustment. Smaller buttons adjust climate settings like fan speed. The Traverse’s MyLink infotainment system still works respectably well, but rivals like the Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander offer larger screens that are more advanced and easier to see.
Exterior StylingStretching over 204 inches, the Traverse is the biggest kid in the midsize-SUV class. In fact, it’s about as long as the last Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV. Its extra size is especially evident in the stretched area behind the rear doors.
There are a few ways to make your Traverse further stand out. The sporty RS trim has blacked-out accents and big, 20-inch wheels. The Redline edition that’s exclusive to the high-end Premier model is even more aggressive with black and red accents, including on the wheels. Top-end High Country models go big on the chrome and feature a twin-panel power sunroof.
Favorite FeaturesSMARTSLIDE 2ND-ROW SEAT
The Chevy Traverse’s SmartSlide 2nd-row seat makes accessing the last row less of a gymnastics routine. Just pull a handle and the seat raises and slides forward to open a larger entrance to the third row. Over the years it saves a lot of time and stress.
REAR CAMERA MIRROR
This optional innovation enables the rearview mirror to switch from a traditional glass mirror to an all-digital display connected to a rear camera. The benefit is a wide, clear image of what’s behind you.
Standard FeaturesThe 2021 Chevrolet Traverse lineup is broad, spanning seven trims. The least expensive is the L and includes a V6 engine and some niceties like tri-zone climate control, six USB ports, and an infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen display and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration.
Stepping up one trim, the Traverse LS adds a traction-mode select, deep-tinted rear windows, and high-intensity headlights. Be aware that neither of these base models can be had with active safety features like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist, features that are standard on rivals like the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Kia Telluride, Hyundai Palisade, and more.
If you’re set on a 2021 Traverse, we recommend getting at least the LT Cloth model, which adds a power-adjustable driver’s seat and heated outside mirrors.
Seven-passenger seating is standard (eight is optional).
Factory OptionsAfter you’ve taken our advice and chosen at least an LT Cloth trim, we highly recommend adding these two options: the Convenience and Driver confidence package that includes remote start, an 8-inch touchscreen, heated front seats, and a power tailgate. With that package, you can now add Driver Confidence II, which includes the all-important active safety features we keep urging.
The LT Leather brings a plusher interior and blind-spot monitoring, but you’ll still have to pay extra for the aforementioned safety features.
The Traverse RS adds 20-inch wheels, the Driver Confidence II package, IntelliBeam automatic high-beam headlights, and the LT Premium package that’s optional on LT Leather trims. That package bundles an 8-inch display, Rear Camera Mirror, and 10-speaker Bose audio.
The Traverse Premier has heated/ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a hands-free tailgate, heated and auto-dimming side mirrors, LED headlights, a power-adjustable steering wheel, memory settings, perforated leather, and wireless phone charging.
The top-line Traverse High Country comes loaded with amenities that are optional on other models. Among them are a hitch-guidance trailering camera and a dual-panel sunroof. Exclusive on the High Country is adaptive cruise control, enhanced automatic emergency braking, power-folding 3rd-row seats, and 20-inch polished alloy wheels.
Engine & TransmissionThe Traverse uses a 3.6-liter V6 that makes a robust 310 horsepower. The engine is tied to a 9-speed automatic transmission.
The Traverse comes standard with front-wheel drive (FWD). All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on all but base L models, and a good choice if you live where it snows, or roads can be slick. For maximum traction, the Traverse High Country adds a dual-clutch transfer system that can automatically adjust the amount of torque going to each rear wheel, further preventing slippage. The Chevy Traverse SUV is rated to tow up to 5,000 pounds when optioned with the trailering package.
The Traverse has an engine idle start/stop feature, but unlike those of rivals, it cannot be disabled.

The 2021 Chevrolet Traverse carries over unchanged

The Traverse is Chevrolet’s 3-row crossover SUV. It plays in the midsize SUV segment with the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, and Ford Explorer, but is larger than those rivals. The Chevrolet Traverse is a tempting vehicle for families, thanks to its extra interior room and a starting price that undercuts most competitors. We also like its standard V6 engine, the ability to tow up to 5,000 pounds, and seating for seven or eight passengers.
Where the 2021 Traverse struggles is in some feature content. Unlike its competitors, active safety systems are not included on lower models. That means to get important aids like forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking, you must choose a higher trim, thus spending more money and defeating the Traverse’s value proposition. Chevrolet has already announced that it’s rectifying this in the refreshed 2022 Traverse, on sale later in 2021.
Comparatively, two of the hottest new crossovers in the segment, the Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade, include a bevy of safety and driver assists including adaptive cruise control. To get active cruise on a Traverse, you must pay over"

AWD adds $2,500, and a fully loaded V6 Genesis AWD tops out at just over $53,000. The V8-powered, fully loaded Genesis tops out just under $55,000. Compared with the base Cadillac CTS, Lexus GS, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series, the 3.8-liter Hyundai Genesis is priced significantly lower. Be sure to check KBB’s Fair Purchase Price, which shows what others in your area have paid for their cars. As the Genesis continues to improve the brand’s image, we expect to see resale values go up, but that is something that will be determined over time. As it stands now, the 2016 Genesis holds only average resale values on par with the Cadillac CTS and Lincoln MKS, but still far behind those of the Audi A6, BMW or Lexus GS.
Driving the Used 2016 Hyundai GenesisIn the 2016 Genesis sedan from Hyundai, you’ll find a midsize-luxury car that feels agile and responsive, yet is devoid of the rough and sometimes jarring ride offered by its European rivals. The Genesis is no BMW 5 Series, mind you, but in terms of steering feedback, braking and acceleration, the Genesis never left us feeling underwhelmed. The 3.8-liter V6 is well matched to this car and although we prefer the 420 horses afforded by the 5.0-liter V8, the available AWD on the V6 trumps our need for speed. Both engines are paired with an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission that delivers smooth and instantaneous shifts, especially when set to Sport mode. Standard paddle shifters help with aggressive driving, but we think most Genesis owners will simply let the car do all the work. The Genesis’ seats are marvelously comfortable and its cabin whisper quiet at highway speeds.
Interior ComfortHyundai wants to appeal to a younger audience, and the design and amenities inside help the 2016 Genesis sedan meet that goal. The cabin is stylish and clean and uses real wood and metal accents in some models. There are soft-touch materials and excellent attention to detail throughout, and the color combinations are pleasing to the eye. Significantly, the Genesis sedan uses an intuitive, centrally located scroll wheel and push buttons, similar to Audi’s MMI system, to toggle through the navigation system, phone and more.
Exterior StylingAs is the case in the interior, the 2016 Hyundai Genesis’ body lines are clean and elegant. Up front, the new Genesis sports an imposing grille. From there, the midsize-sedan body has long, attractive lines that convey a sense of quality and refinement. The trunk line finishes in an aerodynamic sloping design that is reminiscent of the Audi A7 and Toyota Avalon.
Favorite FeaturesHANDS-FREE SMART TRUNK OPENERNeed to open the trunk but you’ve got two arms full of grocery bags? No worries. Just approach the Genesis’ rear end and after three seconds (with the key fob on your person) the Smart Trunk system senses your presence and automatically opens the trunk.
IN-CABIN CO2 SENSORCO2 in great quantities can be dangerous, causing slowed reaction times and drowsiness. The 2016 Hyundai Genesis offers the industry’s first CO2 detector, bringing fresh air into the cabin when it detects elevated CO2 levels.
Standard FeaturesNavigation with an 8-inch touch screen and Bluetooth come standard, as do nine airbags, the hands-free Smart Trunk opener, the Blue Link infotainment system, and paddle shifters. Heated front seats (plus a 12-way power-adjustable driver’s seat), push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seating, tilt/telescopic steering column, heated side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and tire-pressure monitoring are also included at the base price.
Factory OptionsIf you want to add some cool options to your new Genesis sedan, Hyundai offers a head-up display, a 16-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, 17-speaker Lexicon surround-sound audio, a 9.2-inch high-definition navigation screen, rearview camera, front and rear parking assist, and headlight washers. Other nice available features: all-wheel drive on the V6 version, a power rear sunshade, and the Lane Departure Warning system with Lane Keep Assist and the ability to vibrate through the steering wheel if the Genesis senses you drifting out of your lane. Order the 5.0 V8 and all these features (excluding AWD) come standard.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2016 Hyundai Genesis’ V6 and V8 engines both use direct-injection technology with a strong focus on drivability, low-end torque and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. Off-the-line response is impressive with both engines, and fuel economy is competitive with other V6 and V8 models in this class. Both engines are backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission, designed and built by Hyundai, with different gear ratios for the V6 and V8.

Driving the  2021 Nissan MuranoThe new 2021 Murano drives comfortably and a bit more luxe than you might think a mainstream brand’s product would. The Murano’s suspension deals with bumps and potholes with calm composure. You can easily eat up the miles on the interstate and enjoy a lack of fuss on city streets.
Under the hood, the Murano’s standard 260 horsepower V6 has plenty of punch, meted out via Nissan’s continuously variable transmission (CVT), the only transmission available in the 2021 Murano.
While some automakers’ CVTs come under criticism for putting a giant wet blanket on performance and acceleration, Nissan has found the secret sauce to make feel it both quick under full throttle and relaxing at steady-state speeds. It mimics traditional shifts fairly well, and though there are no shift paddles on the steering wheel, you can create virtual shifts by placing the transmission lever in manual mode. We also noticed this characteristic in a recent Nissan Pathfinder, which uses the same CVT. The only caveat here is that long highway inclines or long-duration acceleration runs will have the engine parked at a high rpm for much longer than a transmission with actual gears and can cause droning from the engine, which might become tiresome.
One other caveat and a result of the excellent ride comfort is that the Murano’s handling agility suffers because of the relative cushiness, so driving fun is not high on its list of talents. Also, visibility suffers a bit due to the Murano’s substantial rear blind spots.
Interior ComfortThe Murano’s roominess is perhaps forgotten because it does not offer a third row of seats. But most SUVs of this size with a third row suffer just to make that claim. If you need a third row, there’s the longer and larger Pathfinder. So, the Murano provides better-than-average space for the rear passenger that it does accommodate. What a concept. With that second row of seats stowed, the Murano offers 67 cubic feet of cargo space, which is slightly shy of what you’ll find in a Honda Passport, Subaru Outback, or Ford Edge, but still plenty for most buyers’ needs.
The Murano’s driver and passenger seats offer good comfort and range of position, and they’re improved when clad in the leather that comes in the two higher trims. Ergonomically, one or two controls are placed strangely (like the audio volume buttons at the lower left on the steering wheel).
Exterior StylingNissan put design at the forefront of the original Murano’s mission in 2003, and this continues today. Among the first crossover SUVs that avoided the 2-box traditional utility format, the Murano has, through all its generations, always accented curvy, organic lines peppered with interesting details and trim shapes. This current generation in production since 2015 uses what Nissan calls a “floating roof” and Nissan’s “V-Motion” front end design. Other recent updates include LED headlights and taillights. Murano S and SV come with 18-inch wheels, while SL and Platinum trim levels get 20-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesCOMFORT AND REFINEMENT
While it offers all-wheel drive for better all-weather traction, the main focus of a Nissan Murano is comfort and refinement. It delivers both in spades.
STANDARD V6 ENGINE
The 2021 Nissan Murano’s 3.5-liter, 260 horsepower V6 has been in production for a very long time, but it is in no way outdated. It’s powerful, smooth, does not rely on a turbocharger to make its power, and has a long track record of reliability.
Standard FeaturesThe 2021 Murano comes in four trim levels: S, SV, SL, and the top-line Platinum (plus the option of all-wheel drive for each). The least expensive Murano S has dual-zone climate control, push-button start, and an 8-inch touch display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity in addition to a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/Bluetooth audio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, but all Muranos now come equipped with Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 suite comprising automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot warning, lane departure warning, and high-beam assist. This now also includes Rear Automatic Braking (or automatic emergency braking when reversing).
Muranos in S and SL trims come with basic cloth seats, so to bring things up to what should probably be the segment standard, we’d opt for the SV, which adds power front seats and the option of Prima-Tex faux leather, roof rails, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a universal garage remote.
Factory OptionsPackaged as trim levels reflecting additional options, going from the base Murano S ($32,510) to the Murano SV ($35,640) adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated outside mirrors, LED fog lamps, power front seats, adaptive cruise control, and light-colored wood interior trim.
Jumping to the SL ($40,010) adds a heated steering wheel, 20-inch wheels, driver’s seat position memory, leather seats, heated front and rear seats, up-level 11-speaker Bose audio system, Nissan’s Around View camera system (shows an overhead view of the car which eases parking maneuvers), a power liftgate and traffic sign recognition.
The most expensive 2021 Murano (at $44,060), the Platinum trim encroaches on the luxury SUV space with semi-aniline leather seats with diamond-quilted inserts, a dual-panel moonroof, power-adjusting steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, and NissanConnect Services, which allows you to control functions such as locking the vehicle remotely from your phone.
Engine & TransmissionNissan’s 3.5-liter V6 makes 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. It easily moves the Murano with gusto, does not require 91 octane premium fuel (87 octane is just fine), and does not have start/stop system that shuts off the engine at stoplights and stop signs.
This engine is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission, which does not have traditional gears. CVTs are efficient but tend to drone, especially under hard acceleration. However, Nissan has honed its CVTs better than some other manufacturers, and this one feels close to a traditional automatic, except on only the longest highway grades when a high engine speed is maintained to ascend inclines.
Muranos come standard with front-wheel drive, and all trims can be optioned with all-wheel drive for $1,550. However, due to the CVT, the Murano can only tow a puny 1,500 pounds, which is very low for any SUV. Jeep’s Grand Cherokee with its base V6 engine can pull 6,200 pounds, while a Honda Passport with all-wheel drive can tow 5,000 pounds (and 3,500 with front-wheel drive).

New paint colors (Scarlet Ember Tintcoat, Magnetic Black Pearl, Boulder Grey Pearl)

Nissan’s 2021 Murano enters the new year right smack in the middle of the hottest market segment in the U.S. As a midsize SUV, the Murano’s refined, comfortable nature has placed it a small cut above many other 2-row midsized SUVs in the past, like the Ford Edge, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Chevy’s Blazer. But now, with the competition updated, the Murano lags behind some newcomers and freshened staples. These include the Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota’s new Venza, Honda’s Passport, and Volkswagen’s roomy Atlas Cross Sport.
Still, the Murano offers a premium feel and creamy ride quality, though the continuously variable transmission (CVT) can drone more than a conventional 6- or 7-speed automatic when pressed. Thankfully, a 3.5-liter V6 engine worth 260 horsepower belts out plenty of oomph, even if parked in front of a transmission that causes some droning. The Murano also offers a sleeker, less off-road-ready look for those uninterested in portraying themselves as lumberjacks ready to fell a forest. The 2021 Murano gives plenty of room for passengers and cargo, and that’s really what matters in the wilds of suburbia. And with a full package of active safety features standard across the range of four trim levels. 2021 Nissan Murano PricingThe 2021 Nissan Murano starts at"

Styling feeling a little dated",26150,"The Toyota Tacoma is the best-selling midsize truck available, and has been for the past 15 years. There are good reasons for this, namely the Tacoma’s reputation for high quality, high resale value, and a vast variety of engine/cab/bed choices. In fact, with 33 configurations, there’s a Tacoma to suit a wide range of needs and tastes, from an economical work truck to an off-road beast with optional manual transmission.
Today’s Tacoma faces a resurgence in the midsize truck market, with the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon reborn a few years ago, an all-new Ford Ranger also re-entering the market, a new Nissan Frontier around the corner, and the just-arrived Jeep Gladiator appealing to off-road enthusiasts. In the face of these challengers, the 2021 Tacoma remains more than competitive.
The Tacoma got a freshening last year that gave it standard tech like Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and all models include Toyota’s suite of active safety and driver-assist features like automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. This year it gets minor updates like standard dual-zone climate control on V6 models, and the introduction of special editions.
The Tacoma isn’t quite as fresh as its competitors, but it’s still the go-to recommendation for the majority of midsize truck buyers.
 2021 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab PricingThe 2021 Toyota Tacoma has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) that is as wide as its lineup. At its least expensive, a 4-cylinder Tacoma SR Access Cab begins at $26,150, plus a $1,175 destination fee. At the other end, a 4-wheel-drive Tacoma TRD Pro Double Cab starts at $46,780. The rest of the models fall between this $20,000 price differential. A mid-trim Tacoma TRD Sport or Off-Road model will begin in the mid-$30,000 range.
These prices are in line with the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon and Nissan Frontier. The Honda Ridgeline and Jeep Gladiator both begin over $33,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying.
The Toyota Tacoma’s resale value is excellent. In fact, the 2020 model won the Best Resale Value Award for midsize trucks.

Driving the  2021 Toyota Tacoma Access CabFor most drivers, the Tacoma’s 159-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder base engine can get the job done, but don’t look for stellar passing power when towing or climbing steep grades. While at first glance, fuel-economy figures may seem attractive, they’re not all that much better than what the V6 delivers. This leads us to suggest that if you can afford the extra cost, the V6 is the better choice.
With 278 horsepower on tap, the 3.5-liter V6 moves the Tacoma with brisk bursts of acceleration and also enables it to tow up to 6,800 pounds. The 6-speed automatic is an older design, but it gets the job done. We know that in today’s world, the manual transmission is seen as an oddity, but if you’re still a fan of three pedals, the Tacoma is the rare truck that offers one. And it’s a surprisingly good one. The 6-speed manual connected to the V6 is offered in all TRD models, and it’s a joy to use.
The cat-back exhaust in the TRD Pro models may sound cool at first, but it can tend to drone on longer treks. Thankfully this model also includes a premium audio system.
Seating is comfortable, especially with the new power-adjustable seat, and the cabin logically arranged with all the most important switchgear within easy reach. We found the Tacoma’s ride firm but not nearly as jarring as the Ford Ranger. The steering is impressively responsive. We do think the Tacoma’s steering-wheel-and-pedal placement may prove challenging for drivers with long legs, but otherwise, we have no gripes with the cabin layout.
Interior ComfortDepending on cab configuration, the Tacoma seats either four or five passengers. Access Cab models have just two small rear seats. If you plan to use the Tacoma as a family vehicle or to regularly accommodate rear-seat passengers, you’ll want the Double Cab. This provides a roomy bench seat that can accommodate three passengers and has plenty of legroom.
As is Toyota’s tradition, build quality in the 2021 Tacoma is excellent. The interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats, and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like, and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting.
All 2021 Tacoma models include a central touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and available in either the standard 7-inch or larger 8-inch variety. As we noted in Favorite Features, the 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat that’s standard on SR5 and above models makes a big difference in comfort and accommodating a variety of body sizes. Otherwise, base models retain the old 4-way manual adjust driver’s seat – with no height adjustment.
Exterior StylingNow in its third generation, the 2021 Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015. Still, we think the Tacoma’s design has held up well. Last year it got some new details, including a redesigned grille and a new taillight design. The SR5 and above have optional day-running headlights.
The Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old-school. It is available with either the smaller Access Cab that has half-size rear-hinged doors or the Double Cab with standard-size doors. Two bed lengths are available. All Access Cab models have the longer 6-foot bed, while Double Cab models have a choice of the 5-foot short bed or long bed. Note that even as a “midsize” pickup, the Tacoma is substantial. An Access Cab model stretches 212.3 inches, while a Double Cab long-bed model spans 225.5 inches. If you plan to park your Tacoma in the garage, take some measurements first.
Modern cues include LED daytime running lights, and the separate models — SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-road, TRD Pro and Limited — each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.
A new special edition for 2021, the Trail Edition, includes built-in lockable storage bins on each side of the truck bed. The one on the driver’s side can also act as a cooler thanks to its drain plugs for when the ice melts.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SAFETY SYSTEMS
Like other new Toyotas – and unlike this one’s GM competitors — every Tacoma includes a full suite of active safety systems. Called Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), it bundles lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.
10-WAY POWER-ADJUSTED DRIVER’S SEAT
Last year Toyota finally rectified one of the Tacoma’s faults, giving it a power-adjustable front seat. This 10-way adjuster with lumbar support is standard beginning in TRD Sport trims.
Standard FeaturesThe Toyota Tacoma is available in half a dozen main trims: SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, Limited, and TRD Pro.
At its most basic, an SR model includes 16-inch steel wheels, composite bed, heated exterior mirrors, 4-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and the TSS-P safety system.
We suggest stepping up to at least an SR5 trim. This level adds 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, leather-trimmed steering wheel and shift lever, 4.2-inch information display, more advanced tire-pressure monitor, keyless entry, fog lights, and auto-dimming rearview mirror.
TRD Sport models are even more recommendable, adding the V6 as standard, a 120-volt power outlet in the bed, wireless phone charger, premium audio with navigation, LED daytime running lights, and the ability to add more options.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, TRD Off-Road models include alloy wheels, Crawl Control and terrain select on automatic transmission models, and locking rear differential. Tacoma Limited models have leather interior, 18-inch polished alloy wheels, silver grille, LED headlights, power moonroof, premium JBL audio system, surround camera system, and blind-spot monitoring. TRD Pro models have their own special wheels, heritage Toyota logo in the grille and other special badging, leather interior with heated front seats, Fox shocks, skid plate, cat-back exhaust, and multi-terrain camera system.
Options vary by trim, and they can vary a lot depending on all the dozens of configurations available. They include the V6 in SR and SR5 models, 4-wheel-drive in models that don’t already have it as standard, power moonroof, blind-spot monitoring, and JBL audio system. Of course, there are many accessories available, too, from a tonneau cover to a Desert Air Intake (aka, a snorkel).
The new Trail Edition is based on the SR5 Double Cab, while the new Nightshade with its darkened aesthetics is based on the Limited Double Cab.
Engine & TransmissionPower for the 2021 Toyota Tacoma comes from a choice of two engines. Standard is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine good for a modest 159 horsepower. Power can be routed to the rear wheels (2WD) or all four (4WD) but only via a 6-speed automatic transmission. A better choice is the 3.5-liter V6 that offers nearly 120 more horses and a significant boost in torque, yet delivers nearly identical fuel-economy figures as the smaller 4-cylinder. You’ll also get a choice between the 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmission.

Driving the  2021 Nissan ArmadaOn the plus side, the 2021 Armada is roomy and quiet, at least in the first two seating rows. The subdued-yet-thrilling rumble of the muscular V8 adds to the eager anticipation of road trips, as long as the distances between gas stations are not too great. The 4WD Armada is EPA-rated to return just 18 mpg on the highway.
The front seats are well cushioned and pleasantly supportive, making long stints behind the wheel bearable. And overall comfort is improved by the availability of heated and cooled quilted leather seats on Platinum models, as well as a heated steering wheel.
The automatic transmission does its job efficiently, and 4X4 versions have a low gearing range for optimum off-road ability, which is enhanced by a useful ground clearance of 9.1 inches. But for serious trips on the trail, the Armada could use an off-road package.
On the minus side, the Armada’s considerable size can be a liability around town. City streets are often rougher, exposing limitations in the Armada’s suspension setup. This is also when the steering might feel heavy to some.
Interior ComfortAfter climbing into the raised driving position, then adjusting the seat and steering column (there’s a wide range of movement, so most people should find their ideal setup with ease), it quickly becomes apparent that the large glass areas give the Nissan Armada superb outward vision.
Changing the focus to inside the cabin, the quality of materials, wood trim, substantial-feeling switchgear, and excellent general fit and finish put the Armada almost in the same league as its luxury Infiniti counterpart. The improvements in button size and location for 2021, as well as the new 12.3-inch touchscreen, make the appearance far less cluttered and the experience more seamless than past models.
Behind the third row is 16.5 cubic feet of cargo area. This expands first to 49.9 and then a maximum of 95.4 cubic feet when both the second and third rows are folded.
Exterior StylingThis is Nissan’s largest SUV, and it’s pretty chunky, upright, and tall. That’s part of its charm. The new grill, fenders, headlights, and hood create a look that’s more distinctive, upscale, and sophisticated.
The entry-level Armada rides on 18-inch alloy wheels, which is fine, but the 20-inch versions on the SL and the 22-inch wheels on the Platinum look more appropriate (even if they do have a slightly adverse effect on ride quality).
A new Midnight Edition package available on the SL trim, completely blacks out the vehicle’s exterior and includes unique 20-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT AROUND-VIEW MONITOR
This kind of feature is often found in luxury vehicles. It’s a) really helpful and b) kind of cool to have a camera system that does so much more than provide a rearward-looking aspect. Drivers get a full 360-degree picture plus a bird’s-eye view. It’s standard in the SL grade and looks brilliant on the new 12.3-inch display.
SECOND-ROW CAPTAIN’S CHAIRS
For those families and/or businesses that can sacrifice one seating space in their SUV, selecting the optional pair of captain’s chairs brings far more comfort to the second row while improving access to the third row. It’s an option only available in the SL and Platinum grades.
Standard FeaturesThe 2021 Nissan Armada full-size SUV comes in SV, SL, and Platinum trim levels. A lower-priced S model will be available at a later date. The SV comes with a trailer brake controller and tow hitch, 6-speaker Bose audio system, wireless Apple CarPlay, and wired Android Auto, navigation, 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, NissanConnect concierge services, 4 USB ports (2 type A and 2 type C), hands-free text messaging assistance, keyless entry/ignition, front/rear parking sensors, heated side mirrors, forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and Rear Door Alert (see the Safety section below).
The SL trim kicks off with 20-inch alloy wheels, adds a power tailgate, leather seats (memory driver’s seat) and door trim, LED fog lights, intelligent around-view monitor, remote engine start, a power liftgate, 13-speaker Bose audio system, and more.
The Platinum model has 22-inch wheels, quilted leather heated and cooled front seats, rear heated seats, a family entertainment system (dual rear screens), 3rd-row power recline and fold seats, traffic sign recognition, intelligent backup collision intervention, and an intelligent rearview mirror displaying the feed from the rear-facing camera, rain-sensing wipers.
Factory OptionsFour-wheel drive is available in every version of the 2021 Armada.
The SV appearance package includes 20-inch wheels, fog lights, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a power tailgate. The captain’s chair package is available on SL and Platinum models and replaces the 2nd-row bench seat with individual bucket seats and a padded center console.
The Midnight Edition package can be added to the SL for $1,990 and above grades and essentially dresses the Armada in black from tip to tail. The package brings unique 20-inch wheels (with 275/60R20 tires) as well as black-painted mirrors, roof rails, grille, skidplates, and logos. On the inside, the headliner is black, as is the trim and leather seats. The package adds a specific cargo mat as wells as “Midnight Edition” floor mats.
Engine & TransmissionCompared with main rivals like the Chevy Tahoe, Ford Expedition, and Toyota Sequoia, the 2021 Armada has the most standard power, with 400 horsepower from its 5.6-liter V8 when the tank is filled with Premium fuel (390 hp otherwise). Chevy’s optional 6.2-liter V8 generates 420 hp.
A 7-speed automatic transmission directs energy to the rear axle in standard rear-wheel-drive (RWD) form, or both axles with the optional 4-wheel-drive system. Chevy and Ford both offer 10-speed automatics.
It’s a strong and dependable drivetrain, but hardly thrifty with fuel, averaging around 15 mpg (4WD). The standard maximum towing capacity of 8,500 pounds is impressive. But most rivals have similar abilities and, in some cases, more when optioned with a tow package.

The Armada’s body-on-frame construction is old-school but effective, contributing to a skill set that includes some real off-road talent in 4-wheel-drive form and the capacity to tow a substantial 8,500 pounds whether you select a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) or 4-wheel-drive (4WD) Armada. New this year are a standard trailer brake controller and trailer sway control technology that works with the stability control system to help keep towed loads tracking straight. Although the Nissan Armada does have a low-range transfer case, helpful for off-pavement excursions, the Nissan doesn’t offer a specific off-road package.
Rivals like the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition, and Toyota Sequoia have the same kind of construction and offer similar abilities, but with 400 horsepower, the Armada has the most powerful standard engine of the bunch. It also reaches Infiniti (Nissan’s luxury division) heights of luxuriousness in its plushest model (Platinum Reserve), while even the entry-level (SV) still comes well equipped.
Be aware that fuel economy is not a strong point, nor is the Armada a resale-values champ.

The Camry Hybrid LE starts at $29,385, the Hybrid SE at $31,085, and the top-line XLE at $33,685.
So how does the 2020 Toyota Camry compare with the competition? For the most part, the Camry’s pricing is in line with rivals like the Nissan Altima and Honda Accord, but a bit higher than the Kia Optima, Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, and all-wheel-drive Subaru Legacy. The Camry Hybrid is considerably more expensive than the Accord Hybrid, but on par with the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid.

Driving the  2020 Toyota Camry HybridFor all of its life, the Toyota Camry has presented itself as a comfortable family sedan that never pushed the boundaries, yet still felt quite satisfying. That’s no longer the case, as the 2020 Camry sports a radical look designed to banish boring from the Camry’s family history.
Its performance aspects are enhanced by a stiff body structure, a low stance, and a double-wishbone rear suspension. The result is a ride that is firm without being harsh and handling that allows the Camry to round corners with ease. Does the Camry handle as well as the Honda Accord? We’d have to give the edge to the Accord, which feels a bit more nimble plus has a quieter interior. The Camry’s ride is still impressively smooth, and its steering response spot-on. We also love the Camry’s 8-speed automatic transmission, which we prefer over the Accord’s CVT. To be fair, Accords with the 2.0-liter engine get a 10-speed automatic that is every bit as satisfying as the Camry’s transmission.
Most buyers will opt for the standard 4-cylinder engine, which provides acceptable levels of performance but exceptional fuel economy. Those who demand instantaneous bursts of speed will want to go with the Camry’s 3.5-liter V6. With over 300 horsepower, the V6 can easily have the front tires leaving rubber on the road.
A new feature this year is all-wheel drive, but it is only offered with the 4-cylinder engine. Unlike the Subaru Legacy, the Camry’s AWD setup isn’t permanently engaged, leaving the front wheels to do the work until the computers sense wheel slippage is about to occur. All-wheel drive helps the Camry feel more stable when cornering and helps secure traction when starting out on icy or snow-covered roadways. The AWD Dynamic Torque Control system sends up to 50 percent of the engine’s power to the rear wheels, but only at speeds under 15 mph. The only downside to opting for an all-wheel-drive Camry is the slightly diminished fuel economy and 2-gallon smaller fuel tank.
New this year is a Camry that pushes the performance envelope. The 2020 Camry TRD was developed in conjunction with Toyota Racing Development with an eye at stealing away customers shopping performance-oriented sedans such as the Kia Optima, Nissan Maxima, and Mazda6. A firmer suspension, lower ride height, and larger wheels return a firm, sometimes jarring ride, but for some, the way the TRD hugs the curves may negate any concerns about ride comfort.
Interior ComfortInside the 2020 Toyota Camry’s cabin is an artful blend of style, materials, technology, and versatility. The overall feeling is one of solidity and purpose. There’s a touch of Lexus in the Camry’s asymmetrical dash design, with sharp angles and rounded curves comprising the top pad, instrument cluster binnacle, and center control surrounds.
Passenger space is more than ample, and the nicely-bolstered front seats provide good support without pinching larger-framed occupants. Trunk space varies by trim, set at 14.1 cubic feet on the L and 15.1 cubic feet on all others. By comparison, the Honda Accord offers 16.7-cubic feet of cargo space. Neither the L nor the TRD model feature folding rear seats, the former to save on costs and the latter to accommodate increased bracing.
In a nod to “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” we applaud Toyota’s choice to retain a traditional console-mounted gear selector. It’s just easier and more logical to use than the push-button selectors found on the Ford Fusion and Honda Accord. The same goes for the Camry’s straightforward controls and big 7- or 8-inch touchscreen infotainment setup.
Exterior StylingLong gone are the simple lines and demure styling of Camry’s past. The 2020 Camry is a whole new animal, and we think it’s the best looking sedan ever to wear the storied name. For many, the Camry’s racy styling may be all they need to reconsider the family sedan, with its wide front grille and sculpted aluminum hood, it almost looks like a large, 4-door Toyota 86.
Among the many unexpected design elements are the four chrome-tipped exhaust pipes found on the XSE trim and the black painted roof option on the TRD and XSE trims. The limited-run Camry Nightshade edition plays of the car’s dramatic styling with dark trim and wheels, as well as black badges and emblems.
At the farthest end of the standard family-sedan look is the new TRD trim. This model gets a unique suspension that puts the Camry lower to the ground. There are unique wheels, blacked-out trim with lower red stripping, and a slick wing attached to the Camry’s trunk lid. Color choices for the TRD are limited to black, silver, red, and white.
Favorite FeaturesCAMRY HYBRID
The Toyota Camry has been a long-time player in the hybrid sedan game, and the 2020 Camry Hybrid continues the winning streak. With an EPA estimated 52-mpg, the Camry Hybrid easily dominates competitors such as the Ford Fusion Hybrid, Kia Optima Hybrid, and even the mighty Accord Hybrid.
TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P (TSS-P)
Now standard on every Toyota Camry, the Toyota Safety Sense P suite of driver assists includes adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and lane-keep assist.
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Toyota Camry model range includes the L, LE, SE, Nightshade, XSE, XLE, and TRD. The hybrid models cover LE, SE, and XLE. Standard equipment on the most basic Camry L includes the TSS-P driver-assist suite, 7-inch touchscreen audio, integrated rear backup camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus Bluetooth and remote keyless entry.
For an additional $545, the better-equipped LE adds an 8-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a 60/40 split fold-down rear seat.
Also standard on every trim is Toyota Care, which includes complimentary maintenance for two years or 25,000 miles and 24/7 roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsMore options appear on higher trims, like the Camry SE’s darkened exterior styling treatment, 18-inch wheels, sport bucket seats, and performance-oriented suspension. XSE and XLE trims get leather seating, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 7-inch configurable instrument cluster, blind-spot monitor, panoramic glass roof with a built-in moonroof, three selectable drive modes, and an electric parking brake. Both the XLE and XSE can be equipped with a V6 engine.
Based off the sporty SE, the new TRD trim includes a V6 engine, a sport suspension, unique 19-inch matte-black wheels, a custom interior with red stitching on the seats, steering wheel, and TRD embroidered head restraints as well as red seatbelts.
Other options sold in packages or as standalone items include the JBL premium audio system, navigation, full-speed adaptive cruise control, wireless smartphone charge pad, a head-up display, ventilated front seats, and a bird’s-eye 360-degree camera.
All-wheel-drive models include the Cold Weather Package that brings heated side mirrors and front seats to the LE trim, and on XLE and XSE, a heated steering wheel.
Engine & TransmissionResiding beneath the 2020 Toyota Camry’s lightweight hood are three engine options. Standard is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder producing 203 horsepower (206 in the XSE). When paired with the 8-speed automatic, this engine returns an impressive 41-mpg highway fuel economy estimate.
Next up is the 3.5-liter V6. With 301 horsepower, this engine delivers impressive 0 to 60 sprints yet still manages to keep fuel consumption figures in the mid to upper 20s. The same 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters is employed for use with the V6.
Finally, there is the Camry Hybrid’s 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and electric motor combination. This pairing returns improved performance over the non-hybrid 4-cylinder Camry and better fuel economy with an estimated 53-mpg highway number.

#2 in Best Midsize Cars of 2020
The Toyota Camry continues to be one of America’s favorite family sedans, offering value, reliability, safety, and comfort. While generations of Toyota Camry design have been what might best be described as inoffensive, the 2020 Toyota Camry is literally the stellar opposite. Redesigned two years ago, the Camry is now one of the most dynamic sedans in its class, easily the equal of the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, and Nissan Altima.
The 2020 Camry only gets better this year, now available with all-wheel drive (AWD) to help it better compete with the Subaru Legacy and Nissan Altima. In a bid to lure customers away from the Nissan Maxima and sporty Kia Optima, a track-tuned TRD Camry makes its debut. Finally, after years of legal wrangling, Toyota and Google have finally made nice, allowing Android Auto to join Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa as part of the Camry’s standard infotainment setup.
Despite its massive overhaul, the Camry still touts a bit of old-world meets new. For example, where some rivals have moved to turbocharged small displacement 4-cylinder engines, the Camry retains its proven and powerful V6. At the other end of the spectrum, the Camry Hybrid uses a sophisticated gasoline/electric powertrain that returns a 53-mpg highway. But even the basic gasoline-only Camry attains EPA fuel economy ratings in the low 40s, a remarkable achievement considering the Camry’s size.

#13 in Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
While the Ford Explorer isn’t as significant to the automaker’s bottom line as the almighty F-150 pickup truck, it’s an important player nonetheless. Look around; Explorers are everywhere. Consider this: The Ford Explorer is the most popular SUV ever sold in the U.S., with all-time sales rapidly approaching the 8 million. And sales of this perennially popular three-row midsize SUV undoubtedly will be helped by the all-new 2020 Ford Explorer, which is arriving at dealerships right now.
Like the outgoing model, the 2020 Ford Explorer is a unibody design featuring a chassis made of sheet-metal stampings welded together to form the main structure of the vehicle. Whereas the old model was based on the front-drive unibody chassis of the Taurus sedan, the 2020 Ford Explorer’s new chassis has rear-wheel-drive (RWD) architecture with a longitudinal engine and transmission. As such, this new 2020 Explorer represents a return to this model’s rear-drive roots, but without the truck-like body-on-frame construction.
RELATED: Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
Here’s how the new Ford Explorer compares to its closest competition:
2020 Ford Explorer vs. Chevrolet Traverse
The 2020 Ford Explorer is smaller than the Chevy Traverse, which is one of the largest vehicles in the segment. Compared to the Traverse, the Explorer’s wheelbase is nearly 2 inches shorter and the Ford is 5.5 inches shorter overall. That translates primarily into reduced cargo space: With all seats in place, the Explorer’s cargo capacity is nearly 5 cubic feet less than the Chevy’s. With the third row folded, or with all seats folded, the Traverse has about 10 cubic feet more cargo space than the Ford. Additionally, Chevy provides seat belts for three (small) passengers in the third row, meaning the Traverse can seat up to eight passengers, or seven with 2nd-row captain’s chairs. The Explorer third row seats just two, so maximum passenger count is seven with the 2nd-row bench or six with captain’s chairs.
All versions of the Traverse are powered by a 3.6-liter V6, while the Explorer’s mainstay engine is a 2.3-liter turbo four. The Chevy’s V6 makes 310 horsepower versus 300 for the Ford 2.3L, but the Traverse’s 266 lb-ft of torque trails the Explorer’s 310 lb-ft. The Traverse does not offer more powerful engine options to compare with the Explorer’s 365-hp or 410-hp turbo V6s. The maximum trailer-tow rating for the Traverse V6 is 5,000 pounds. The non-hybrid Explorer tows up to 5,300 pounds with the 2.3-liter or 5,600 with the turbo V6.
The starting price of the base 2-wheel-drive Chevrolet Traverse is $31,125, which is some $2,000 less than the entry-level Explorer. The top-spec Traverse is the High Country AWD, priced at $54,395—that’s about $5K less than the Explorer Platinum.
2020 Ford Explorer vs. Honda Pilot
Compared to the Honda Pilot, the 2020 Explorer rides on a 9.1-inch longer wheelbase but is only 2.3 inches longer overall, and the vehicles are nearly identical in width and height. Cargo volume and 3rd-row-seat space are also very close. Honda rates the Pilot’s 3rd-row seat for three passengers, which means that most versions of the Pilot are 8-passenger vehicles, while the top-trim levels equipped with captain’s chairs can seat seven. The Explorer’s third row accommodates two, and all Explorer trims save the base model have captain’s chairs, so the Explorer seats six or, at best, seven.
All versions of the Honda Pilot use a 3.5-liter V6 making 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed or a 9-speed automatic. Both those output figures are below those of the Explorer’s smaller standard engine, a 2.3-liter turbo four that musters 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The Pilot’s maximum tow rating with all-wheel drive is 5,000 pounds, while front-drive models can tow 3,500 pounds. The Explorer with its 2.3-liter can tow 5,300 pounds, and 5,600 with its available V6, with either rear- or all-wheel drive.
The base, 2-wheel-drive Honda Pilot LX is $31,450 (plus $1,045 destination), while the Explorer’s starting price is about $1,000 higher. The Pilot Elite is the fanciest trim level at Honda and is priced at $48,020, about $10,000 less than the Explorer Platinum.
2020 Ford Explorer vs. Toyota Highlander
Like the Explorer, the Toyota Highlander has been redesigned for 2020, and not all of the new specs are available. But the Highlander isn’t quite as extensively changed, so there are several comparisons that can be drawn. The new Highlander is slightly larger than before, but it still is smaller than the Explorer. The Toyota’s wheelbase is 9.3 inches shorter than the Explorer’s, and the vehicle is about 4 inches shorter in length. Here again, the difference can be seen primarily in the cargo hold, where the Explorer has a 2-cubic-foot advantage with all seats upright, a 7-cubic-foot advantage behind the second row, and approximately 10 cubic feet more space with all seats folded. Whereas the Explorer seats six in a 2-2-2 configuration (with the base model offering 2-3-2 seating for seven), the Highlander’s 3-passenger third row allows seating for seven with captain’s chairs or eight with a 2nd-row bench.
All versions of the Highlander (except for the Hybrid) are powered by a 3.5-liter V6 with 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. Despite the Toyota’s larger engine, its output is less than the Ford 2.3-liter turbo four’s 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft, and the Explorer further offers more powerful turbo V6 options. The V6 Highlander’s maximum tow rating is 5,000 pounds, versus 5,300 for the Explorer 4-cylinder and 5,600 for the Explorer V6.
Toyota, like Ford, offers a hybrid powertrain, and is one of the only other models in the segment to do so. Unlike the Explorer, however, the Highlander Hybrid uses a 4-cylinder gasoline engine rather than a V6, and total output is 240 horsepower compared to the Explorer Hybrid’s 318 horsepower. While EPA fuel-economy ratings are still to come for the new Highlander Hybrid, City/Highway/Combined mpg numbers for the Explorer have come in at 27/29/28 for the rear-drive version and 23/26/25 in all-wheel-drive form. We expect the Highlander hybrid to return significantly better mileage than the Explorer at the expense of some performance. Toyota is estimating 34 mpg combined, which is outstanding for this class. Another hybrid difference is that Ford offers the Explorer Hybrid in a single trim level but Toyota offers the Highlander Hybrid in multiple trim levels.
Pricing for the 2020 Toyota Highlander has not been released yet, but using 2019 prices as a rough guide, the Highlander starts about $2K less than the Explorer, and the Highlander tops out just shy of $50,000, nearly $10K below the top-spec Explorer.
2020 Ford Explorer vs. Kia Telluride
Impressive new offerings, both. The Kia Telluride, a front-drive-based unibody SUV, has just one engine, a proven 3.8-liter V6 with 291 horsepower. The Telluride’s a couple inches shorter than the Explorer, with a wheelbase five inches shorter than the Ford. From the inside, the Kia feels very roomy, thanks to its boxy shape and an upright windshield that’s not unlike that of the Ford Flex. Max tow rating of the Kia Telluride is 5,000 pounds.
2020 Ford Explorer vs. Jeep Grand Cherokee
Like the new Explorer, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is a unibody SUV with a longitudinal powertrain. But the Jeep is 9 inches shorter overall than the Ford, with a wheelbase that’s down by about 5 inches. The Jeep seats a max of five in two rows; the new Explorer accommodates seven in its three rows. Both of these SUVs have diverse powertrains, the Grand Cherokee’s ranging from a 3.6-liter V6 and a diesel V6 to a 6.4-liter pushrod V8 and a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 in the super sporty Trackhawk. Besides the base turbo 2.3-liter 4-cylinder, the new Explorer is available with a twin-turbo 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6 (365 or 400 horsepower) and a hybrid powertrain featuring a 3.3-liter V6 and an electric motor.
 2020 Ford Explorer PricingThe base 2020 Ford Explorer, just called the Explorer, starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $32,765, plus a $1,095 destination fee. An XLT, better equipped and also fitted with the 2.3, starts at $36,675. The priciest 2.3-liter Explorer, the opulently equipped Limited model, starts at $48,130.
It’s a big jump to the V6 Explorers. The sporty ST starts at $54,740, while the flagship Platinum model begins at $58,250. The new Explorer Hybrid, based on the Limited trim, begins at $53,375 and tops out at about $61,000 when fully optioned.
A 2019 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, one of the Explorer Hybrid’s main competitors, starts at $37,320, a price that can climb to about $50,000 when you order a Highlander Hybrid Limited Platinum model. Interestingly, Toyota’s destination fee is also $1,095.
The lower-end 2020 Explorers are priced in line with other 3-row midsize SUVs, but the Limited and V6 models are getting into luxury-brand territory. As always, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new 2020 Ford Explorer. As far as resale value goes, it’s still early to calculate. Historically, however, while Ford Explorers can’t hang with the resale-value leaders, they do hold a strong 2nd-tier status.
Best Deals on a 2020 Ford Explorer for April
If you’ve been obsessed with the idea of tying a bed sheet around your neck like a cape and trying to fly off your porch roof, April may just be the month to do it. You see, April includes National Take a Chance Day. To make it even better, summon a crowd and then yell, “Hey, everybody, watch this!” before face planting in the driveway. Good times. You won’t be taking a chance, however, when you visit your local Ford dealer to check out the 3.9% APR deal on 84-month loans offered by Ford Credit on new 2020 Explorer models throughout April. Not everyone will qualify for this deal.
There are also some lease deals, too. For example, Ford will lease a new XLT for $350 per month for 39 months. You will need to pony up $4,167 at signing.

Driving the  2020 Ford ExplorerJust how does the turbo 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine feel in this new longitudinal rear-biased application? In a word: fine. The new Explorer XLT felt amply powered, able to merge onto freeways with ease and sustain highway speeds without breaking a sweat. All the while, the 10-speed automatic upshifted with a metronomic regularity. Gears 8, 9 and 10, incidentally, are all overdrive ratios, so they rarely came into play anywhere but on the highway.
What’s more, the view out the new Explorer’s windshield was excellent, aided by what felt to us like a lower cowl, and the automatic start/stop system functioned so smoothly that I felt no need to shut it off (which I typically do in most other vehicles with this fuel-saving technology).
On some twisty roads north of the Columbia Gorge, in Washington State, the new Explorer acquitted itself well. Yes, this Ford SUV weighs nearly 4,500 ponds, but it felt composed in the corners, where body roll (or lean) never got excessive. Although the all-wheel-drive (AWD) system of the new Explorer SLT disconnects the front axle on the highway for improved fuel economy (and can send as much as 50 percent of the power to the front wheels in slippery conditions), the new Explorer didn’t reveal its rear power bias when accelerating out of corners. All we felt was good acceleration and excellent overall composure.
Driving the 2020 Ford Explorer Hybrid
We tested the new 2020 Ford Explorer Hybrid on a short off-road course and on public roads while towing a 4,500-pound boat on trailer. Our takeaway: The new Explorer Hybrid – our tester a luxurious leather-clad Limited model, employing a 3.3-liter V6 and an electric motor integrated into the front of the 10-speed gearbox – drives much like a standard Explorer.
As with a regular Explorer, you just get in the new Explorer Hybrid and drive. Since a Hybrid was part of Ford’s original plans for this new 6th-generation Explorer, no space compromises needed to be made. For example, the liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack fits perfectly beneath the passenger side of the rear seat, so interior volume has not been negatively affected in any way.
Note: The Explorer Hybrid is not a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, so the battery is smaller than you’ll typically find in PHEVs. The one in the new Explorer Hybrid, made by Ford, is good for about two miles of pure electric driving at 30 mph. Ford, as stated, hasn’t released any fuel economy figure for the new Explorer Hybrid, but the company did say it will have an impressive range in excess of 500 miles.
On the dirt, we climbed a steep grade with complete ease, then descended a different hill with our feet off the pedals using hill descent control to maintain control of the vehicle. All worked as advertised, and a bit father on, we negotiated a banked turn that put the Explorer Hybrid at a side lean angle of 25 degrees. While that may not sound like much, it was enough to make us nervous, although not as concerned as we were when crossing a 12-inch-deep pond in this first gas-electric Explorer.
Similarly, towing a trailer in the Explorer Hybrid proved to be a cinch. The Hybrid is based on the Limited model, so it comes with a trailer hitch as standard equipment and has enough power (319 combined horsepower, 322 lb-ft of torque) to tow a 4,500 boat with ease. There was no problem getting the rig up to highway speed, and although I occasionally could feel the trailer rocking forward a bit during mild throttle adjustments on the highway, it was too subtle to be bothersome.
Driving the 2020 Ford Explorer Platinum
With its 365-horsepower twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6, the Platinum is a hot rod, an Explorer that blends thrilling power with sublime luxury. Real wood trim graces the Platinum’s dash, whose stitched leather cover complements the fine hides on the seats.
The Explorer Platinum we drove had the optional Premium Technology Package, which includes massaging seats, a 980-watt Bang & Olufsen stereo and a 10.1-inch vertically-oriented touch screen on the top of its center stack. This touch screen looks like a permanently affixed iPad, replete with swipe and pinch-to-zoom capability.
Turbo boost arrives quickly on the road in the powerful Platinum, which is also blessed with natural-effort steering, good brakes and a ride that’s comfortable without being wallowy. At a starting price of $58,250, the 2020 Ford Explorer Platinum is by no means inexpensive, but it’s well equipped with a twin-panel moonroof, LED headlights and seemingly acres of interior leather. It also has Reverse Brake Assist, which will automatically stop the Explorer if it senses you are backing up into something.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 Ford Explorer comes standard with a third row of seats that accommodates two passengers. The base Explorer’s second row is a 3-person bench, making for a total seating capacity of seven. Higher trim levels have a pair of captain’s chairs in the second row, meaning they seat a maximum of six. Ford claims the new Explorer has a bit more hiproom and headroom than before, and the 2nd-row seats now can slide fore and aft—a common feature that helps apportion space depending on requirements.
Cargo volume shrinks slightly in the 2020 Explorer, although the load floor now measures 48.1 inches in width between the wheelwells—its narrowest point—meaning that 4’ x 8’ building materials can lay flat (albeit sticking out the back by about a foot). The cargo floor is reversible, with carpet on one side and vinyl on the other. On some trim levels, the power liftgate can be opened by kicking a foot under the rear bumper, and power-folding of the 3rd-row seats is available.
The top-spec Platinum ups its game with leather not just on the seating surfaces but also on the dashboard and the door panels—luxury touches befitting its lofty price. Other niceties include heated front and rear seats and a heated steering wheel.
Exterior StylingAlthough this new 2020 model still clearly looks like an Explorer, the rear-drive architecture has allowed Ford to keep the overall length about the same while extending the wheelbase by 6.3 inches. By moving the front wheels forward, Ford has reduced front overhang and improved upon every important interior dimension in all three rows of seats. The suspension features MacPherson struts in front along with a multilink independent rear. For the record, the base 2020 Ford Explorer is a 7-seater with a 2nd-row bench for three, while almost all the upmarket models are 6-seaters fitted with 2nd-row captain’s chairs.
Favorite Features10.1-INCH VERTICALLY ORIENTED TOUCH SCREEN
The 2020 Explorer’s optional touch screen is the largest the model has ever offered, and can display multiple functions at once, and includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability.
12.3-INCH DIGITAL INSTRUMENT CLUSTER
On Explorer ST and Platinum, the standard instrument cluster is replaced with a 12.3-inch digital display. The display can be customized, including with a minimalist Calm Screen that shows only essential info and is supposed to reduce driver distraction.
400-HORSEPOWER ECOBOOST V6
The new Explorer ST model’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 produces 400 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque, figures that tower above most non-luxury competitors’. The ST can be further equipped with a Track Pack or a Street Pack, options that bring more robust brakes with red calipers and 21-inch wheels, the largest ever offered on an Explorer.
Standard FeaturesEven the entry-level Ford Explorer is well equipped. It has a power liftgate standard, along with satellite radio, dual-zone climate control, Sync connectivity, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 safety suite. The XLT ups the ante with a leather-covered steering wheel and available all-wheel drive, while the Limited and Hybrid add leather-trimmed seats, a 360-degree camera, a foot-operated hands-free power liftgate and power front seats.
In addition to its 400-horsepower engine, paddle shifters, sport suspension and unique appearance, the Explorer ST has leather-covered sport bucket seats, a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, Active Park Assist and a heated sport-style steering wheel. The Platinum model claims its spot at the top of the 2020 Ford Explorer lineup with Tri-Diamond leather seat trim, a twin-panel moonroof and wood interior trim.
Factory OptionsDepending on the model/trim level that you reach for in your new Explorer, you can find extras like leather, heated/ventilated front seats, a 10-way power passenger seat, Ford Co-Pilot360 Assist+, a Qi wireless-device charging pad and as many as four USB ports (including type-C) along with three 12-volt outlets and a 110-volt outlet. These are all found on the Limited models.
At the top of the Explorer lineup — beyond the performance mods of the Explorer ST and the luxury touches on Platinum models — the bounty starts with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster in place of traditional gauges. Both models also come with Active Park Assist as well, which can, at the push of a button, park the Explorer into a parallel or perpendicular spot—operating the accelerator, brake, and steering wheel—and pull it out again. This represents an upgrade over the outgoing model’s Enhanced Active Park Assist, which handles the steering but requires the driver to work the pedals.
The 2020 Ford Explorer offers a number of package enhancements as well:
Class III Trailer Tow Package: This package includes a Class III chassis-mounted hitch, along with trailer connectors and an engine oil cooler. It also includes a cargo management system that provides extra pockets in the rear cargo area and sub-floor storage for smaller items. The Tow Package is a $710 option on the XLT and Limited, and it’s standard equipment on the ST and Platinum Explorers.
Comfort Package: This $715 option, available only on the XLT, really should be called the Winter Package. It includes heated first and 2nd-row seats, plus a heated steering wheel and a windshield wiper de-icer.
High-Performance Package: Available only on the Explorer ST, this $1,595 option includes 21-inch aluminum alloy wheels and larger front brakes with red-painted brake calipers.
Premium Technology Package: Optional on the ST and Platinum, this technology package includes massaging multi-contour seats, a 10.1-inch vertically oriented touch screen (it looks like an iPad mounted atop the center stack) and a 980-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system. A bargain at only $995.
Engine & TransmissionThe previous 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V6 base engine is gone from the Explorer lineup, as the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, previously the step-up engine offering, takes over as the standard powerplant for 2020. At the same time, it adds 20 more ponies for a total of 300 horsepower along with 310 lb-ft of torque, which is more than most competitors’ V6s. A 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6 with 365 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque is exclusive to the Platinum. Powering the sporty new Explorer ST is a 400-hp version of the same engine, with 415 lb-ft of torque. Those numbers out-muscle everything in the 3-row midsize SUV segment save for the Dodge Durango SRT, with its 6.4-liter V8. Finally, an Explorer Hybrid joins the family for the first time, and pairs a 3.3-liter V6 with an electric motor. All engines use a 10-speed automatic transmission, up from the previous 6-speed.
The base, XLT, Limited, and Hybrid models are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The Explorer ST and Platinum come standard with all-wheel drive. Ford’s Terrain Management System consists of a series of drive modes selectable via a knob on the center console, altering dynamics including accelerator sensitivity, transmission shifting, steering effort, suspension firmness, traction-control programming, and all-wheel-drive torque management. Available modes include:
Normal, which seeks to balance comfortable motoring with some driving excitement, is intended for everyday driving.
Sport, aptly named, sharpens the throttle response and steering while providing quicker shifts. The 10-speed automatic, also used in the Mustang and Ranger, holds gears longer for faster acceleration.

Eco, via throttle and gearbox adjustments, maximizes the fuel range of the 2020 Ford Explorer. This does come with a small sacrifice in performance.
Tow/Haul improves the action of the transmission while you’re towing with your Explorer. Upshifts occur at higher engine speeds to reduce the frequency of shifts, and more engine braking is allowed, making life easier for the Explorer’s brakes during descents. The amount of downshift braking is related directly to how much pressure the driver applies to the brakes.
Slippery makes continual adjustments to the Explorer’s throttle response, transmission shifting schedule and traction control to help this Ford SUV keep moving on wet grass, slushy roads or any surface that might be covered in, say, a thin layer of sand or gravel.
Deep Snow/Sand is what you’ll need if you’re trying to reach the office before the snowplows have cleared the roads. Via steady adjustments to the throttle, shift points and traction control, this mode keeps the 2020 Explorer going, even in deep sand.
Trail is intended for use in muddy, rutted, soft or uneven terrain. As in the Deep Snow/Sand model, the Explorer’s forward mobility is significantly enhanced via a shift schedule and traction control tailored specifically the given condition.
Note: Rear-wheel-drive (RWD) 2020 Ford Explorers also are equipped with the Terrain Management System, but it doesn’t include the Deep Snow/Sand mode. We hope a limited-slip rear differential, which would help make the RWD Explorer more capable in the dirt, becomes available.

The off-road-focused Sierra AT4, with Rancho shock absorbers and a 2-inch lift kit, starts at about $51,000, while a fully loaded 2020 GMC Sierra Denali can kiss nearly $70,000. Most buyers will land somewhere between those numbers. If these prices for a new truck sound high, it’s actually just the reality these days, and in line with rivals like the Ford F-150 and all-new Ram 1500, not to mention the Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan. The 3.0-liter Duramax diesel costs $3,890 more than the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder, and $2,495 more than the 5.3-liter gasoline V8.
The GMC Sierra’s pricing tends to be a little higher than that of its Chevrolet Silverado sibling. Ram offers a lower-cost alternative in a previous-gen version of its 1500, called the Classic.

Driving the  2020 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabOur first drive of the new GMC Sierra was in the Sierra Denali Crew Cab. Our test model was fitted with the excellent 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8, which is the Sierra’s top-of-the-line engine. This big V8 has a low, healthy growl, and power off the line is smooth and quick. The engine uses Dynamic Fuel Management to control cylinder operation, but we could never tell when it was working — that’s a compliment to its seamless nature. The new 10-speed automatic offers quick response when you accelerate, and power delivery is easy and rewarding. Shifts are smooth, not jumpy, and can be quickened when you engage the Sport drive mode.
On the other end of the spectrum is GM’s new 2.7-liter 4-cylinder turbo, which is also offered in the Chevy Silverado. If you don’t think a 4-cylinder engine can power a full-size truck, this one will make you reconsider. We found it peppy, quick and enabled the truck to feel light on its feet.
Also new this year is an impressive 3.0-liter Duramax diesel, a smooth turbocharged inline-6 that gives the Sierra excellent EPA highway fuel economy of up to 30 mpg along with a respectable max tow rating of 9,100 pounds. What’s more, this light-duty diesel, which mates to a 10-speed automatic transmission, is refined enough for everyday use.
No matter your engine choice, ride quality is very good, and braking is nicely predictable and linear. When the previous Sierra was introduced, it boasted arguably the quietest interior in the segment. The new Sierra’s cabin is even quieter. Even though the interior doesn’t have the same pizazz as that of the new Ram, controls are nicely placed and easy to use, and color choices are clean and tasteful.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 GMC Sierra’s cabin is sharp and upscale with a good amount of soft-touch surfaces, but it doesn’t quite raise the bar in design. The cabin is wonderfully roomy and quiet, and the optional head-up display is large and easy to read. Depending on trim and cab configuration, the 2020 Sierra can seat three passengers (regular cab), or five or six with crew and double-cab configurations.
The seats are comfortable, and if you get the 5-passenger Sierra, there is a big storage compartment in the center console. There are also clever side-hinged storage areas in the front of the rear-passenger seats. While the Sierra now has push-button start for the first time, you can’t get anything but a column shifter and manual tilt/telescoping wheel. Base models with a regular cab still make do with hand-crank windows and manual door locks, but all other models have power accessories.
Exterior StylingBiggest visual difference between the GMC Sierra and its Chevrolet Silverado kin is the styling, but that isn’t all. As mentioned, the GMC offers a higher-tech solution to truck-bed access and a higher degree of utility with the MultiPro tailgate, which lets you access gear six different ways. One position creates a tailgate step and uses a small bed handle to make it easier to climb up.
If the new Sierra is equipped with power-retractable steps, a button on the back angles the step closer to the bed. The off-road-oriented AT4 trim has a 2-inch factory lift, dark exterior accents, beefy all-terrain tires and a pair of red tow hooks in front. Every Sierra comes with side corner steps in the rear bumper and 12 cargo tie-downs in the bed. Offered initially in Denali trims is a carbon-fiber bed, which GMC says is the toughest bed it has ever made.
Favorite FeaturesPROGRADE TRAILERING
For 2020, the Sierra’s ProGrade Trailering System gets even better. Thanks to tech magic derived from the all-new Sierra heavy-duty series, the system features 15 camera angles, including a first-of-its-kind transparent trailer view. By combining cameras on the tailgate and a remote one at the back of the trailer, it creates an invisible outline of the trailer, enabling you to virtually “see through” it.
MULTIPRO TAILGATE
The 2020 GMC Sierra is the only place you can get this innovative tailgate, which can be reconfigured six different ways to make it easier to load, organize and remove gear, or simply create a seat for optimum tailgating. It also comes up with a power up/down feature controlled by the key fob.
Standard FeaturesAs with rival trucks in this segment, the GMC Sierra spans from a basic work truck on one end to a leather-laden, feature-rich luxo-cruiser on the other. At its most basic, regular-cab form, the 2020 GMC comes with a 4.3-liter V6, 4-way manual-adjust seat and 17-inch painted silver wheels.
While the interior is basic with crank windows and only a 2-speaker stereo, you do get a 7-inch touch screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, Bluetooth pairing and a USB port. We recommend stepping up to at least the SLE trim, which adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, keyless entry, automatic climate control, chrome bumpers, Wi-Fi hotspot, and 6-speaker audio system.
Factory OptionsPlenty of creature comforts, technology and driver-assistance and safety aids can be had on the 2020 GMC Sierra by climbing trims or adding options. They range from leather interior and 8-inch touch-screen system with navigation and Bose premium audio to the aforementioned MultiPro Tailgate and a selection of wheels.
Active safety and driver-assist options include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring and, new for 2020, adaptive cruise control.
Top-line GMC Sierra Denali models include heated and ventilated front seats, wireless phone charging, universal garage-door opener, remote start and dual-zone automatic climate control. Denali and AT4 trims are also offered as Carbon Pro Editions, which feature an exclusive, ultra-tough carbon-fiber pickup bed.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2020 GMC Sierra offers a choice of six engines, including two different versions of GM’s 5.3-liter V8. There are also two types of cylinder-management systems to improve fuel economy. Active Fuel Economy is the better-known cylinder shut-off system that has helped boost GM truck mpg. Dynamic Fuel Management, introduced last year, is designed to fine-tune the balance between efficiency and power demand. It lets the engine operate anywhere between two and eight cylinders, within 17 different patterns.
Base Sierras still use a 4.3-liter V6 that we found just barely gets the job done. Unless low cost is your greatest priority, we recommend stepping up to another powertrain. The 2.7-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder is surprisingly peppy and helps make the Sierra feel more nimble and athletic. We are still waiting to test the new diesel, but it sounds promising. Then there are the V8s. Tried-and-true, the 5.3 continues to impress, while the 6.2-liter V8 remains a real workhorse with loads of smooth power.
All 2020 GMC Sierras use an automatic transmission, either 6-, 8-, or 10-speed depending on engine and trim. Some of the engines also use a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle to save fuel. The system can be deactivated with the press of a button.

#4 in Best Pickup Trucks for 2020
Fresh off a complete redesign, the 2020 GMC Sierra is a highly capable choice among full-size trucks. Though it has similar underpinnings and powertrain choices as its Chevrolet Silverado sibling, the Sierra distinguishes itself with a bit more premium flair and design differences. And while its towing max of 12,200 pounds still falls short of the figures put up by the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500, the Sierra has a few tricks up its sleeve. Its ace card is an exclusive 6-way multifunction tailgate that’s pure genius. And if you regularly tow, the new transparent trailer rear camera must be seen to be believed. Throw in a choice of six engines that includes a new turbodiesel inline-6, and the 2020 Sierra is a strong, well-rounded pickup that deserves your attention.

Yet the 330i lacks a certain edge compared to rivals like the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Genesis G70, which offer manual transmissions for those seeking the most engagement. If you simply want a quick, relatively nimble and posh compact-luxury sedan that speaks to your rising status, the new BMW 330i fits the bill.
If you’re all about the “Ultimate Driving Machine” mantra, however, the high-powered 340i feels like a return to form for the 3 Series. If the terms” E36” and “E46” mean anything to you, head directly to the new BMW M340i on the showroom floor. With a proper inline-6 under the hood and performance-minded tuning to the chassis and suspension, the M340i is a legitimate heir to those past 6-cylinder 3 Series models that are the legends of Internet forums and YouTube videos.
We had the chance to flog an M340i on a track at BMW’s performance center outside Palm Springs, and can assert it’s the real deal. It hits 60 mph in as little as 4.1 seconds, and its tenacious grip allows it to scream around the tarmac. Most rewarding is simply the sum of its parts.
All models of the new BMW 3 Series use an 8-speed automatic transmission that works smoothly, quickly and exactly as intended. This is the part where some reviews would lament the absence of three pedals in the new 3 Series, and while we also love a good manual, the reality is so few new-car buyers do that they simply weren’t making financial sense for BMW. We can hold out hope, though: A new BMW M3 is around the corner.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 BMW 3 Series’ 5-passenger interior is clean and elegant, but hardly revolutionary. Some might find it a little too clinical and sterile. But if you’ve ever owned a BMW, you already know this and likely prefer it this way. Minimal as it may be, the 3 Series’ material and build quality are worthy of its luxury badge.
Soft-touch surfaces abound, as do intelligent touches like physical knobs and switches where needed. A large 8.8-inch touch screen linked to BMW’s iDrive controller handles the rest of the in-car functions and features.
Seating is firm and supportive and we especially like the sport seats in the M Sport version. Thanks to its elongated body, the 3 Series finally has a back seat fit for adults. Trunk size has increased to 17 cubic feet and can be expanded via the 40/20/40-split-folding rear seat.
Exterior StylingThe BMW 3 Series was just reborn last year, when it entered its seventh generation, but its shape is not a drastic departure from previous versions. Everything is a little larger than prior generations, but the proportions work well, and we are thankful that the 3 Series’ grille isn’t ostentatious.
The new, higher-power and more performance-oriented 2020 BMW 340i sits 0.4 inches lower than the 330i. The front fascia has larger side intakes, while the rear sports a beefier valance and larger exhaust housings. The new BMW 3 Series comes with 18-inch wheels, with 19s optional.
Favorite FeaturesM340i PERFORMANCE MODEL
If you’re a fan of past 3 Series with BMW’s inline 6-cylinder engine and its effortless, balanced performance, this is the model to get. With 382 horsepower, it also packs the most for a 3 Series outside an M3.
DRIVING ASSISTANT PROFESSIONAL PACKAGE
It’s a mouthful, but this recommendable package bundles features like steering/lane-control assist and traffic-jam assist. Combined, this semi-autonomous driving system takes some of the stress out of congested commutes.
Standard FeaturesIn its least-expensive version as a rear-drive 330i, the 2020 3 Series luxury sedan comes in Sport Line form and includes 14-way power-adjustable front seats, 3-zone automatic climate control, auto-dimming rearview mirror, power moonroof, universal garage remote, and BMW’s SensaTec faux leather upholstery.
Safety features include automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warning. The new 3 Series’ standard infotainment bundles an 8.8-inch display with navigation and 205-watt/10-speaker audio system with Apple CarPlay integration.
As for Android Auto, you’re out of luck. BMW is among the few automakers that doesn’t support it.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive can be had on any 3 Series by choosing the xDrive option. Choosing the Luxury line adds chrome flourishes and ambient lighting, while the M Sport line grants a sport suspension, variable sport steering, LED fog lights and other performance-oriented bits and aesthetics. As is the case with BMW, many more options are available bundled in packages or as stand-alone options. Among them are genuine leather upholstery, wood or aluminum interior accents, and an upgraded Harman Kardon audio system.
We would recommend getting the Convenience package, which costs $2,350 extra or is bundled into the M Sport line. It includes blind-spot monitoring, parking sensors, hands-free power trunk operation and keyless entry, and lumbar support. For $1,700 more, you can add the Active Driving Assistant with semi-autonomous driving ability. Other goodies include heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, a head-up display and a fully digital dashboard. We’d skip the Gesture Control function for the audio system; it has proven meh in our testing.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2020, the 3 Series now has a choice of two engines. The 330i models use a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 255 horsepower and an ample 295 lb-ft of torque. This will be more than adequate for the majority of buyers simply seeking a well-driving, luxury-badged compact-performance sedan. At up to 36 mpg, this 330i is also very efficient.
If you’re the kind of person who craves an adrenaline rush with your acceleration, get the 340i. This more powerful 3 Series debuts for 2020 with a turbocharged inline-6 cylinder putting out 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. All new 3 Series models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD), which BMW calls xDrive, is optional.
All models have an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. If you don’t like the engine turning off at stoplights, you can disable the system with the press of a button.
BMW also plans to introduce a gas-electric hybrid version of the 3 Series called the 330e, and we suspect a high-performance next-gen M3 is also around the corner.

#3 in Best Small Luxury Cars of 2020
Long considered the benchmark for compact-luxury sports sedans, the BMW 3 Series now has more competition than ever. Foes range from longtime German rivals the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4 to newcomers like the Genesis G70 and Alfa Romeo Giulia. Still, the 3 Series remains a top seller, and for good reason: When corporate climbers want to display their success, a BMW badge is one of the most prominent markers.
Totally revamped last year, this 7th-generation 3 Series also brings the latest technology and safety features. Performance ranges from good to great. The base 4-cylinder 330i, introduced last year, will satisfy buyers prioritizing the badge, while the new-for-2020 M340i that packs a 382-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder will attract the BMW faithful truly in it for the “Ultimate Driving Machine” mission of the 3 Series.
Traction-enhancing all-wheel drive is available on all models in lieu of the standard rear-wheel drive. But if you’re seeking a manual transmission or Android Auto support, you’ll have to look elsewhere.

Driving the  2020 Dodge ChallengerGiven the wide range of Challenger models, the driving experience is different depending on the engine, transmission, mechanical specification, available equipment, and where and how you drive the car. However, they all have one thing in common, which is an uncanny ability to transport you back in time.
From the car’s exterior and interior design to its rear-wheel drive and aging platform and architecture, the Challenger looks and feels like an old car fresh off the assembly line. Think of it as a classic with a full factory warranty and modern technology, and you’ll get a sense of what this car is about.
It’s about speed, too, though the 303-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 in the SXT and GT trims makes the Challenger merely quick rather than outright fast. You can get all-wheel drive with the V6, though, making it a good choice for people who want the muscle-car image combined with usability in winter.
Traditional American muscle is standard in the Challenger R/T, which offers the legendary 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine with up to 375 horsepower, while the R/T Scat Pack’s 6.4-liter V8 delivers an impressive 485 horses. The Scat Pack version is also offered in Widebody style with wider wheels and tires for better grip.
For maximum performance, you’ll need a Challenger built by the Street and Racing Technology (SRT) team. The SRT models boast a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 making 717 horsepower in the Hellcat and an astounding 797 horsepower in the Hellcat Redeye. According to Dodge, the Redeye runs from zero to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, blasts through the quarter-mile in 10.8 seconds at 131 mph, and screams to a top speed of 203 mph. Widebody versions of the SRT models are also available.
Interior ComfortBased purely on its roomy and comfortable interior, you’d never know that the Challenger is capable of serious shenanigans. If you need a muscular coupe with accommodating front seats and decent rear-seat space, this is your car. And the trunk is enormous, though the liftover height is quite high.
Retro yet modern, the driver-oriented layout features up to an 8.4-inch touch-screen infotainment display as well as a sophisticated driver-information center between the main gauges. Depending on trim level, you can dress a Challenger’s interior in premium materials such as Nappa leather and Alcantara suede, and you can add comfort and convenience upgrades like a heated steering wheel and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi connection.
No doubt, the Challenger’s thick rear roof pillars take some getting used to, but blind-spot warning and a rearview camera make the Challenger easier to drive. We also recommend the available rear parking-assist sensors.
Exterior StylingThe Challenger’s classic long-hood/short-deck proportions and wide stance sneer “performance” in every single model, and with their flared fenders and other details, the Widebody R/T Scat Pack and SRT Hellcat models shout it outright.
Details like hood scoops, script badging and optional stripes amplify the car’s retro appearance and legit muscle-car credentials. The Challenger just looks cool, blending a timeless yet modern appeal with the masculine swagger of an MMA champion. And if that swagger isn’t enough you can also get some of the bright colors with the fun names from back in the day, like IndiGo Blue, White Knuckle and Go Mango.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE
Muscle cars are all about blistering straight-line performance, but the Challenger SXT and GT models with a V6 engine and all-wheel drive focus on daily drivability all year long. This feature not only improves the Challenger’s cornering and handling, but makes the car easy to drive in the snow. So go ahead and challenge that Camaro SS or Mustang GT — as long as the white stuff is covering the ground.
SRT HELLCAT REDEYE
Although it costs nearly $75,000, the Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye delivers an impressive performance-to-dollar value. With an eye-popping 797-horsepower 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8 bellowing from under its dual-scooped hood, and a full mechanical upgrade to support it, this version of the Challenger is ready to rock against a Camaro ZL1 or Mustang Shelby GT500.
Standard FeaturesHighlights from the Challenger’s standard-equipment list include 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, heated outside mirrors, hound’s-tooth cloth seats with 6-way-power adjustment for the driver, dual-zone automatic climate control with a humidity sensor, keyless entry and a reversing camera. The standard infotainment system equips the car with a 7-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, six speakers, and USB and auxiliary inputs.
Factory OptionsThere are six different Challenger models (plus Widebody versions), and each has its own list of standard equipment. As is true of most vehicles, the higher up the trim level ladder you climb, the more stuff you get.
That stuff includes numerous appearance and performance improvements, three different grades of leather, infotainment enhancements like a larger display and navigation, premium sound systems, advanced driving-assistance systems (ADAS), and much more.
Specific examples from the popular Challenger R/T trim level include several stripe and wheel designs, premium Nappa leather with Alcantara simulated-suede trim, an 8.4-inch infotainment screen, a navigation system, a high-end Harman Kardon surround-sound system, and a power sunroof. No less than 12 different option packages are also available for the R/T, installing equipment ranging from heated front seats and a heated steering wheel to Blacktop, Shaker and T/A appearance groups.
To equip a Challenger R/T with all of the available ADAS, you’ll want the Driver Convenience Group for its blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert system, and the Technology Group for adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, and more.
Engine & TransmissionIn the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) SXT and GT, a 303-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 is the standard engine, with all-wheel drive (AWD) offered as an option on both trims.
Moving up to the R/T brings the first in a series of Hemi V8s, in this case a 375-horsepower 5.7-liter unit and a 6-speed manual transmission (the 8-speed automatic reduces horsepower to 372). The R/T Scat Pack is powered by a 6.4-liter Hemi V8, also known as the 392, rated at 485 horsepower with either the manual or 8-speed automatic.
The SRT Hellcat adds a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with 717 horsepower, which would make it the king of Challenger Hill if it weren’t for the 797-horsepower SRT Hellcat Redeye. Both versions require premium gas to make maximum power. Get the Hellcat if you want a 6-speed manual transmission, though the optional 8-speed automatic doesn’t shortchange performance. Redeyes come standard with the automatic.
Obviously, none of these cars are fuel-economy kings, although the V6 models aren’t bad.

Limited-production 50th Anniversary Edition package available
Fresh paint, wheel, interior & badge options

In the world of blue-blooded muscle cars, you have three choices: Camaro, Challenger and Mustang. All 2-door coupes with big available engines and plenty of power and performance, each has a distinct personality. Among the trio the 2020 Dodge Challenger is the burly linebacker that offers the clearest line of sight to its original forebear while providing the most daily-driver practicality in the group.
Built on the same platform as the Dodge Charger, the delightfully retro Challenger is larger than the Chevy Camaro and Ford Mustang, meaning it has a usable rear seat and trunk. In terms of performance, the Challenger runs the gamut, starting with the 303-horsepower SXT and more than doubling that output with the fire-breathing 797-horsepower SRT Hellcat Redeye.
Buyers seeking the best bang for the buck will be more than happy with the R/T trims that offer impressive power, desirable features, and a surprisingly comfortable ride at a relatively reasonable price. No matter which version you choose, though, Dodge offers a dizzying array of colors, add-ons and features to make the 2020 Challenger one of the most customizable performance cars money can buy.

The all-conquering Camaro ZL1 starts at about $62,500. The track-focused ZL1 1LE model starts around $71,000. Convertible models run about $6,500 higher than coupes.
Thanks to a generally higher level of standard equipment, prices are pretty much on-target with its crosstown rival, the Ford Mustang, and both the Ford and Chevy cost less than the Dodge Challenger.
Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others in your area paid for their new 2020 Camaro. Over the long haul, the Camaro should hold its value comparably to its Mustang rival, just below that of the Dodge Challenger but better than the Nissan 370Z.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet CamaroIf you haven’t driven the Camaro in a while you’re in for a surprise. Gone are the days when this was a straight-line sled. The launch of the 6th-generation platform really took things up a big notch. The latest version of the Chevy muscle car is smaller, lighter and delivers handling more in line with what you might expect of a European sports coupe.
That said, it still packs a visceral punch whenever you smack the throttle. At 275 horsepower, even the base turbocharged 4-cylinder version matches the output of a V8 Camaro from a few generations back. The latest-generation SS bumps that up to 455 horsepower with its 6.2-liter 8-banger. And if you really want to feel yourself thrust into the back of your seat, you’ll be well advised to consider the blindingly-fast ZL1 with its supercharged version of that V8 punching the horsepower up to 650.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 Chevy Camaro’s interior is a mix of the old and new. There are elements of the original car here, such as the dual hoods over the instrument cluster and the numerous chrome surrounds on various controls. Modern touches like heated seats and a touch-screen infotainment system bring the muscle car into the 21st century, but the Camaro’s sleek exterior design presents some ergonomic issues inside the cabin.
The tiny window openings create a claustrophobic feel and a preponderance of black plastic doesn’t help. Narrow sun visors are practically useless when swiveled to shade the door glass. The sport seats feel terrific and can accommodate drivers of all sizes. The same can’t be said for the Camaro’s rear seat, however, which is little more than a padded parcel shelf. If you regularly need room in the back for passengers, the Dodge Challenger may be a better choice.
Exterior StylingLast year’s Camaro mid-cycle refresh kicked up a dust storm, with many loyal fans shaken by the funky look of the new bumpers, front and rear, as well as the coupe’s headlights. These updates aside, there were no major changes to sheet metal, and the overall look of the 6th-generation Camaro continues to hearken back to the classic 1969 edition, one of the most attractive muscle cars ever. The thinner headlights give the 2020 Camaro a menacing squint, reinforced by the bulging hindquarters and sweptback roof.
Favorite FeaturesCAMARO 1LE TRACK PERFORMANCE PACKAGE
The 1LE option vastly improves the Camaro’s cornering ability by borrowing suspension and brake bits from the SS trim. Available with either the V6 or V8 engine upgrade, the 1LE package includes Brembo brakes, beefier anti-roll bars, stiffer shocks and dampers, 20-inch wheels, a limited-slip rear differential and a satin-black hood.
CAMARO CONVERTIBLE
One way to eliminate the Camaro’s numerous blind spots is to remove the roof. With the convertible, you can do just that. The Camaro’s cloth power top lowers with the push of a button and stows neatly behind the rear seat. When up, the sturdy top provides good protection from rain and wind noise.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2020 Chevy Camaro is the 1LS, which comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. Standard amenities include power windows, cruise control, an 8-way-power driver’s seat and a 7-inch touch-screen audio system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, dual USB ports, AUX input, and GM’s 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot.
There’s also a driver-selector mode that includes Snow and Ice, Tour and Sport, plus automatic climate control and a color driver-information display between the gauges. Upscale features include push-button start and keyless entry and a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel. Multiple airbags and advanced stability control help keep you safe. All versions of the 2020 Camaro get Chevy’s 3rd-generation infotainment technology.
Factory OptionsOn the new Camaro’s options list are an 8- and a 10-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, two different Brembo-brake upgrades, an upgraded audio system with a larger 8-inch touch screen, and an enhanced driver-information center similar to the Corvette’s.
The Camaro SS offers magnetic ride-control suspension, a power sunroof, in-dash navigation and a dual-mode exhaust system for more V8 rumble. A remote engine-start system is available.
Optional safety technology is limited to the LT and SS trims and includes blind-spot monitoring, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, Lane Change Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert, all helping to minimize the Camaro’s compromised outward visibility. Chevy also offers numerous wheel options.
Engine & TransmissionThere are four engines available in the 2020 Camaro. There’s the standard 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with a muscular 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Step up to the 3.6-liter V6 with 335 horsepower; it offers more power but less torque than the 4-cylinder, and offers cylinder deactivation for better fuel economy.
But a Camaro needs a V8, and in the Camaro SS there’s the 6.2-liter V8, shared with the Corvette, pumping out 455 horsepower. Step up to the Camaro ZL1 and you’re looking at a 650-horsepower supercharged version, making it the most powerful Camaro ever. All engines connect to a 6-speed manual that includes automatic rev-matching on V8 models.
The 4-cylinder Camaro offers an 8-speed automatic, while V6- and V8-powered cars employ a 10-speed automatic; both of which can be had with paddle shifters.

New 1LT coupe & convertible

While the American sedan’s days seem numbered, the American muscle car continues to find a welcoming audience. Whether you’re one who loves the snarling growl of a big V8 engine, or the potent rush that comes from a fuel-efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder, the 2020 Chevrolet Camaro coupe and convertible have you covered.
Horsepower figures range from 275 in the base 1LS to 650 horsepower from the supercharged 6.2-liter V8 in the ZL1. There’s also a V6 in the mix, as well as a choice between a 6-speed manual or 8- and 10-speed automatics.
With a model range that runs from sporty to superfast, the Camaro keeps pace with rivals Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger, and even flirts with some very expensive exotics.

Driving the  2020 Toyota Tacoma Access CabFor most drivers, the 159-horsepower 2.7-liter engine can get the job done, but don’t look for stellar passing power when towing or climbing steep grades. While at first glance fuel-economy figures may seem attractive, they’re not all that much better than what the V6 delivers, leading us to suggest that if you can afford the extra cost, the V6 is the best choice.
With 278 horsepower on tap, the 3.5-liter V6 moves the Tacoma with brisk bursts of acceleration and also enables it to tow up to 6,800 pounds. The 6-speed automatic is an older design, but it gets the job done; however, the 6-speed manual would still be our choice over the automatic.
Seating is comfortable, especially now with the new power-adjustable seat, and the cabin logically arranged with all the most important switchgear within easy reach. The Tacoma’s ride is firm but not jarring, and the steering is impressively responsive. We do think the Tacoma’s steering-wheel-and-pedal placement may prove challenging for drivers with long legs, but otherwise we have no gripes with the cabin layout.
Interior ComfortThe big news on the 2020 Tacoma is the upgraded infotainment system with a standard 7-inch touch screen and Smartphone connectivity as well as the power-adjustable driver’s seat. Are these usually game-changers? Not exactly, but they might allow the Tacoma to go a few more years without a major update if Toyota decides to go that route.
As is Toyota’s tradition, assembly quality is excellent. The 2020 Tacoma interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting. It gets push-button start, and the handy multi-information display (between the main gauges) shows fuel economy, outside temperature and even off-road info such as trail mode or angle of the Tacoma on a steep hill.
Exterior StylingNow in its third generation, the 2020 Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015 and gets some new details for this model year, including a redesigned grille as well as a new taillight design on all models. The SR5 and above get optional day-running headlights.
Designed and built in the United States, the 2020 Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old-school.
There are modern cues, such as LED daytime running lights, and the separate models — SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-road, TRD Pro and Limited — each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.
Favorite FeaturesAPPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO
Finally, Toyota embraces Smartphone compatibility with a new 7-inch multimedia touch screen (upgradable to an 8-inch screen) and the addition of Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa.
10-WAY POWER-ADJUSTED DRIVER’S SEAT
Again, finally Toyota offers a power-adjusted front seat that even includes 2-way lumbar adjustment. For a truck with a notoriously limited and subpar seating position, this is a huge improvement.
Standard FeaturesFor 2020 the Tacoma includes Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and Alexa compatibility. Toyota Safety Sense, Toyota’s suite of safety features, was added for the 2019 model year. That includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. A rearview camera, a basic version of Entune connectivity, an automatic limited-slip differential, eight airbags, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a lockable tailgate, 16-inch wheels and adjustable tie-down cleats in the bed are also standard.
The standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the rear wheels. Interestingly, the Tacoma uses old-school drum brakes in the rear. On the other hand, the standard GoPro camera mount is as 21st-century as it gets.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2020 Toyota Tacoma start with the 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, including 2-way lumbar support. Other new options include a panoramic view monitor only available on the double-cab models in TRD Sport trim and above. LED day-running headlights and fog lights, and new 16-inch wheels are also part of the 2020 option sheet. There’s the TRD Pro trim level, of course, but beyond that on the tough-truck side of the list are Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control, and a hard tonneau cover.
On the technology side the Tacoma offers rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Making life more comfortable are push-button start with Smart Key, Qi wireless charging, tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated leather seats, Entune with a full app suite, and a JBL sound system. On the TRD Pro, a Desert Air Intake keeps fresh air flowing to the engine when churning up dust and sand.
Engine & TransmissionPower for the 2020 Toyota Tacoma remains unchanged over the previous model year and comes from two sources. Standard is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine good for a modest 159 horsepower. Power can be routed to the rear wheels (2WD) or all four (4WD) but only via a 6-speed automatic transmission. A better choice is the 3.5-liter V6 that offers nearly 120 more horses and a significant boost in torque, yet delivers nearly identical fuel-economy figures as the smaller 4-cylinder. You’ll also get a choice between the 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmission.

Top 10 Features of the 2020 Toyota Tacoma
#1. Midsize could be the right size
Although full-size trucks dominate the market, many buyers would be happy with something smaller. The Tacoma fits that bill while providing Toyota’s renowned reliability.
#2. Choice of engines
The base engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder unit making 159 horsepower, but it’s worth going for the 278-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, which is virtually as economical but far gutsier.
#3. Choice of cabs
The Access Cab takes four occupants; the Double Cab accommodates five.
#4. Choice of beds
Either five feet long or six feet. With the different cabs, beds, driven wheels, engines and trim levels, there are many 2020 Tacoma permutations.
#5. New technology fitted as standard
Despite the base Tacoma being an unpretentious work truck, it still has Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, Amazon Alexa compatibility and three USB ports.
#6. Satellite radio
SiriusXM comes in the base SR trim. It’s a 3-month free trial period, which is a common offer throughout the automotive world.
#7. Tacoma TRD Pro variant
This version of the 2020 Tacoma can handle serious off-road challenges. It includes multi-terrain modes for the all-wheel-drive system, a dedicated specialist suspension and an under-body camera system.
#8. Standard GoPro camera mount
Record all those wild off-roading adventures with ease. It’s located next to the rearview mirror.
#9. Standard driver aids
Every 2020 Tacoma has automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assistance, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control.
#10. Healthy resale values
The Toyota Tacoma has traditionally been a star performer in the resale values stakes, thanks to its reliability and durability.
 
Overview
With the arrival of the new Jeep Gladiator, Ford Ranger and the ever-expanding Chevy Colorado lineup, the aging 2020 Toyota Tacoma is feeling the pressure. However, that doesn’t seem to be slowing sales of America’s favorite midsize pickup. With over 30 configurations, Toyota builds a Tacoma for just about every need, and although it doesn’t offer the latest engine options, the Tacoma still has the muscle and capability to handle tough jobs.
The TRD Pro appeals to those who like to get far off-road, while the base model with its frugal 4-cylinder engine is an affordable and economical small truck. And of course, there’s the Tacoma’s legendary reputation for longevity, durability and reliability, not to mention stellar resale numbers.
 2020 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2020 Toyota Tacoma is all over the place, thanks to the variety of cab, bed, engine and drivetrain choices.

The Work Truck is offered only as a regular cab; the rest (except the High Country) are available as double cabs or crew cabs. The lineup also includes the Custom ($36,195), Custom Trail Boss ($41,095), LT ($38,495), LT Trail Boss ($47,695), RST ($40,395) and LTZ ($44,595). Buyers seeking many of the same features as the High Country but aren’t so interested in that truck’s model-specific interior should investigate an LTZ, which starts at $46,995 for the crew-cab version.

Best Deals on a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado for April
Had you been booked on the Titanic in April of 1912, you would have been among the lucky to have wound up in a lifeboat as the “unsinkable” ship slipped beneath the surface. Yep, the ship’s designers didn’t bother to provide enough lifeboats for everybody on board. It was a really bad day for those in steerage. However, you will get some serious first-class treatment from your local Chevy dealer when you hook up with one of the certified pre-owned (CPO) 2020 Silverado models during the month of April. Chevy isn’t providing any financing incentives this month, but a CPO Silverado is well worth checking out.
CPO Chevy cars, SUVs and trucks have submitted to and passed an intense inspection by a trained technician. Chevy then covers those CPO vehicles with additional warranty protection. Chevy further sweetens the offer with other perks like 24-hour roadside assistance and a free 90-day OnStar/satellite-radio subscription.
The best deals in brief
CPO Silverados are the-best-of-the-best used Chevy Silverado models available, having passed a rigid inspection. They also come with extra warranties and several other added-value benefits.

Side steps
Driving the  2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabThe 5.3-liter V8 has plenty of power, while the standard transmission is quick in its responses. Another plus is that it’s virtually impossible to tell when the fuel-management system is working. The 6.2-liter V8 has a rumbling exhaust to accompany its extra power, but the difference between this and the smaller V8 is not dramatic. It’s a nice option, but unless anyone needs to tow more than 11,600 pounds, the 5.3 is perfectly adequate.
The 2020 Silverado drives smaller than it is, with excellent ride quality, yet the handling is still taut and accurate with little body roll. From steering to braking, everything feels natural and linear. The Silverado had already earned a reputation for its quiet cabins; as far as we can tell, this new generation is even quieter.
Interior ComfortOn the positive side, the 2020 Silverado’s cabins are tranquil, roomy and comfortable, with plenty of handy stowage spaces, including under the rear seats (where fitted). We also like the flat floor in the crew cab’s second row. The interior design is best described as conservative, but that can also be seen as an asset.
On the negative side, there’s no power-tilt/telescoping steering-wheel adjustment in any trim level, and the largest infotainment display available is an 8-inch touch screen. While there are many advanced safety systems, the blind-spot monitoring system doesn’t stretch to vehicles in a trailer’s blind spots.
Exterior StylingSome 2020 Silverado trim levels sport lavish amounts of chrome, while others lean more toward retaining the body color. At least buyers have a choice. The lower trims also have “Chevrolet” stamped in the center bar, the higher levels have Chevy’s bow-tie badge in the center of the grille. The Trail Boss versions sit on lifted suspensions, while their black-finished wheels and door handles provide a little extra attitude.
Favorite FeaturesTOWING TECH
Chevy supplies a useful checklist for connecting a trailer, plus memory settings for five trailer profiles. The driver can monitor the trailer tires’ pressures and even test the trailer lights (usually a 2-person job) through a smartphone app. An optional rear camera shows what’s behind the trailer; the 2020 Silverado revision brings 15 views. In addition, an alarm sounds if the trailer is disconnected while the truck is locked.
10-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
One more great thing about the 2020 Silverado is that it isn’t necessary to splash out for the 6.2-liter V8 to acquire this gem of a transmission — whose quick, smooth shifts make driving this Chevy truck especially satisfying. It’s now available with the smaller V8 in the LT Trail Boss and High Country variants.
Standard FeaturesThe Work Truck is the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado’s base model, employing a 4.3-liter V6, 6-speed automatic transmission, 4-wheel disc brakes, and 17-inch painted steel wheels. Buyers can choose either a vinyl or cloth 40/20/40-split/fold bench seat.
Chevrolet’s Infotainment 3 system is standard, operated through a 7-inch touch screen. Bluetooth is also included, as is Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, plus a 6-speaker audio system, one USB port and a 12-volt outlet.
The beds come with 12 cargo tie-downs, while the rear bumpers have CornerSteps. Buyers can then add more equipment and different drivetrains by ascending the trim levels.
Factory OptionsRemote keyless entry, rear-window defogger, cruise control and power mirrors are optional in the Work Truck, as is a spray-on bedliner. The more interesting extras are a Z71 off-road package, head-up display, wireless device charging, power tailgate, 360-degree camera system, leather upholstery, heated front and rear seats/steering wheel/side mirrors, Bose audio upgrade, and alloy wheels up to 22 inches in diameter.
The Trail Boss includes a 2-inch suspension lift, locking rear differential, skidplates, off-road tires and Rancho shocks. Then there are the choices of the 6.2 V8 and the 10-speed automatic transmission. Trailer tech, which includes the auxiliary-trailer camera, is also available.
Engine & TransmissionA new diesel engine joins the 2020 Silverado range. It’s a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 making an impressive 460 lb-ft of torque that peaks at low revs (1,500 rpm), which is an ideal characteristic for towing and off-roading. It pairs with the 10-speed automatic transmission. The tow rating for this engine is 9,300 pounds.
The base engine is a 4.3-liter V6, with a 5.3-liter V8 available in some variants (linked to a 6-, 8- or 10-speed auto), and a turbocharged 2.7-liter 4-cylinder unit offered in others. The top engine is a 6.2-liter V8, which is now standard in the LT Trail Boss and optional in the High Country.
Two types of cylinder-management systems optimize fuel consumption. Active Fuel Economy is the simpler cylinder shut-off system; Dynamic Fuel Management is designed to fine-tune the balance between efficiency and power demand, allowing the engine to operate between two and eight cylinders, within 17 different patterns.
Most variants have rear-wheel drive (RWD) as their default setup, with all-wheel drive (AWD) available from the options list.

#2 in Best Pickup Trucks for 2020
The 2020 Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup truck is now in the second year of a fresh generation. It provides another choice in the half-ton-truck segment to buyers who are spoiled by years of superb machines from America’s Big Three, plus some keen competition from the Texas-built Toyota Tundra and Tennessee-built Nissan Titan.
This kind of vehicle is usually a best-seller for Chevy, Ram and Ford, so these companies naturally inject huge amounts of research and development, plus a lot of value, to keep each model relevant and alluring.
The Silverado deploys technology and smart engineering to make it lighter, more fuel efficient and roomier than its predecessor. It’s a strong and reliable performer with a broad range of abilities, while spanning from utilitarian Work Truck to high-class High Country trim levels.
Any buyer seeking a new full-size truck should absolutely investigate the 2020 Silverado.

Driving the  2020 Toyota SiennaSafe, stable, comfortable, with light steering and just enough power for overtaking. That doesn’t sound like an enthusiast’s ideal recipe for fun, but it’s exactly what a minivan driver wants and needs. And exactly what a Toyota Sienna supplies. The 3.5-liter V6 is a smooth, muscular engine with a reputation for reliability. Solo jaunts could be slightly entertaining, especially in the SE trim, a variant with a sportier suspension and 19-inch alloy wheels. But the usual tranquility of the cabin is disturbed by a little extra wind and road noise.
Interior ComfortThe Toyota Sienna is seriously spacious. It houses three seating rows, with two occupants up front and three abreast in each row behind. Except for when a couple of captain’s chairs are fitted in the second row. The base L, top-of-the-range Limited and those versions with all-wheel drive are also 7-seaters. The 2020 Sienna provides four LATCH points for child-safety seats. And stowage spaces abound. Fold down both seating rows, with the second row placed as far forward as possible, and cargo area measures 117.8 cubic feet. Removing the 2nd-row seats (which are heavy and somewhat awkward) opens space up to 150 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingNo one buys a minivan to express their personal style. But every customer should appreciate the large glass areas that provide great outward vision for driver and passengers alike. The big doors enable easy entries and exits; power-sliding doors are especially useful. And the one-box design ensures sufficient headroom for every occupant. Anyone desiring a little more visual pizazz might like to investigate the SE trim level for its alloy wheels, smoked headlights and low-level spoilers front and rear.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE
All-wheel-drive systems these days don’t have to be big and heavy. The Audi TT sports car illustrates that. So offering such a system in a minivan seems like a no-brainer. The slight rise in fuel consumption of a Toyota Sienna AWD is surely worth the extra reassurance.
MOBILITY SOLUTIONS
Passengers requiring mobility assistance will really appreciate these optional features for the Toyota Sienna. They include the factory-installed, power-operated Auto Access Seat bringing easier 2nd-row access, plus an aftermarket wheelchair ramp.
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Sienna minivan comes in L, LE, SE, XLE and Limited, plus Premium versions of the top three trims. At the entry level, the 7-seater L has the Toyota Safety Sense array of features (forward-collision mitigation, lane-keeping assistance, intelligent cruise control, automatic high beams and road-sign recognition), plus 17-inch alloy wheels, tri-zone climate control, 7-inch infotainment touch screen, Apple CarPlay smartphone integration, five USB ports, and Amazon Alexa. LE brings power-sliding side doors, power-adjustable driver’s seat, easy-clean seating fabric, and an upgraded infotainment setup. All 2020 Siennas come with Toyota Care, covering two years/25,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive becomes available at the LE level. The Auto Access seat can be ordered for LE and XLE trims. Power-sliding side doors are also part of the LE’s inventory. SE brings a power tailgate, leather seating surfaces for the first two seating rows, and heated front seats. A power-adjustable driver’s seat comes in the XLE, Limited trim has power-folding 3rd-row seats, heated steering wheel, dual moonroof, and front/rear parking sensors. A dual-screen Blu-ray/DVD rear-seat entertainment system with HDMI inputs and two power outlets is optional for the Limited model. But the Limited Premium has pretty much everything, including leather for the third row.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s just one engine in the 2020 Sienna, a 3.5-liter V6 making 296 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. Respectable numbers. And they’re achieved with regular gasoline. Just one transmission as well, an 8-speed automatic. The basic setup is front-wheel drive (FWD), but all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional and, as we’ve already mentioned, no rival offers it. Fuel economy is bearable but not class-leading. Regardless of how many wheels are driven, the Toyota Sienna is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds.

The 2020 Toyota Sienna can be all things to all families. It’s a minivan, so that solves an issue when seeking a vehicle that can seat more than five. The Sienna can accommodate up to eight. Its versatile interior can handle an expensive trip to Ikea just as easily as a road trip to the lake or the coast. The gutsy V6 engine can be trusted to haul a loaded Sienna up steep hills without complaint. And the Sienna is the only minivan to offer all-wheel drive, which is an absolute boon when the weather turns treacherous. Rivals include the Honda Odyssey, Kia Sedona and Chrysler Pacifica.
The Sienna is due for an upgrade, however. A new generation is set to debut perhaps for the 2021 model year and, from what we know, Toyota isn’t particularly inclined to ramp up any sales incentives with this generation.

From a resale-value perspective, the Durango won’t perform as well as a Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander, is on par with the Ford Explorer, and, over time, slightly better than the Chevrolet Traverse.

Driving the  2020 Dodge DurangoAlthough the V8 engines in the 2020 Durango are arguably more newsworthy, the entry-level-yet-refined V6 works well, delivering 293 horsepower and is capable of towing 6,400 pounds. It’s complemented by an 8-speed automatic transmission that only occasionally “hunts” for the right gear.
On the other hand, these V8 engines do distinguish the Durango. The 5.7-liter unit generates 360 horsepower, for superb acceleration with a resonant rumble and a tow rating of 7,400 pounds. The 6.4-liter in the SRT trim develops 475 horsepower, good enough to sprint from standstill to 60 mph in a fleeting 4.4 seconds or tow 8,600 pounds. Ease off the throttle, though, and every version of the Durango can be quiet and comfortable.
RELATED: Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
Interior ComfortIt’s a pleasant place inside the 2020 Durango 7-passenger crossover SUV, with an air about it that seems higher in quality than most rivals, the deluxe Citadel trim in particular. This is the version with heated/ventilated front seats and heated 2nd-row seats.
Most trim levels offer captain’s chairs to replace the bench in the second row, which also make it easier to access the third row and use booster seats. Cargo space when all three rows are in place is useful at 17 cubic feet, expanding to 43.3 and then 85.1. The front-passenger seat also folds down, so the Durango can take quite long items. Citadel and SRT versions may also be specified with headliners of simulated suede.
Exterior StylingBeginning with the most basic Durango SXT, the look is bold, decisive and certainly not easily mistaken for any other midsize SUV. Move up the line to the GT and the look gets a bit meaner, the Citadel more upscale and the R/T looks like a Charger on steroids, offering an SRT-style hood with a large air scoop. Step into an SRT, and you’ll have an American-made SUV that can run with the likes of BMW, Porsche and Audi, at least on the track.
Dodge never shies away from making bold statements and we appreciate the numerous statements made by the 2020 Durango, from its “racetrack”- shaped taillight, to the massive wheel-and-tire combos, to the bold paint colors and graphic decals. The Durango really is one of a kind.
Favorite FeaturesDURANGO SRT
While not as practical as one of the V6 models, the 6-passenger SRT version is still accommodating of people and cargo, but its crazy fast acceleration times, sharp handling and glorious-sounding exhaust note know no equal from Honda, Nissan or Toyota.
UCONNECT 4
Still one of the most complete and easy-to-use infotainment systems around, the 2020 Dodge Durango’s Uconnect 4 system features a large touch screen, easy-to-figure-out controls and is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. Controls for the heated seats and steering wheel, as well as optional navigation and climate are also incorporated into the touch screen.
Standard FeaturesThe SXT entry-level trim has seating for five, tri-zone automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, V6 engine (with a Sport mode to spice up the driving experience), load-leveling rear shock absorbers, heated side mirrors, keyless entry/ignition, and an infotainment system that includes AM/FM radio, Bluetooth, auxiliary audio input, six speakers and a 7-inch touch screen.
Moving up the 2020 Durango’s trim levels brings more equipment, such as auto high beams, a power tailgate, sunroof, navigation, Nappa leather seats, and more. Versions with V8 engines receive beefier brakes, while the SRT also has a sport-tuned adaptive suspension.
Factory OptionsSome options are available in the base Durango SXT for 2020, such as a sunroof, all-wheel drive with low-range gearing, roof rails, cosmetic additions, 20-inch alloy wheels, satellite radio, trailer-prep package, and rear parking sensors.
But the higher trims are eligible for more extras, including an 825-watt/19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, 8.4-inch infotainment system with navigation, Blu-ray/DVD rear-seat entertainment system, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision mitigation, and lane-keeping assistance. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is optional throughout the range. For towing, choose the 220-amp alternator, heavy-duty engine oil cooler and Class IV hitch receiver.
Engine & TransmissionWhile many newer midsize SUVs have moved to turbocharged 4-cylinder engines as the base offering, the 2020 Dodge Durango starts off with the powerful Pentastar 3.6-liter V6. This engine provides excellent response, can tow up to 6,400 pounds and returns the best fuel economy of the three choices.
Up next is one of two Hemi V8s. Standard in the R/T and available on Citadel, the 5.7-liter V8 produces a class-leading 360 horsepower and is the ideal choice for those needing power and performance without breaking the bank.
Last up is the massive 6.4-liter Hemi V8 offered only in the all-wheel-drive SRT. With 475 horsepower on hand, this engine makes the Durango one of the most powerful SUVs in its class.
All but the SRT Durango are powered by their rear wheels (RWD) with the option of three different all-wheel-drive (AWD) systems. V8 models with AWD also feature a low-range transfer case with a neutral position. An 8-speed automatic transmission handles gear changes for all three engines.

#20 in Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
In the 2020 Dodge Durango SUV, you’ll find room for seven passengers, a phalanx of high-tech infotainment and driver assists, and a set of engine options no Subaru, Honda or Toyota can match. As midsize SUVs go, the Durango is the most American of the set, offering aggressive styling and muscle-car-like performance with admirable abilities like an 8,600-pound max tow rating and 8.1 inches of ground clearance.
Unlike the Subaru Ascent and Toyota Highlander, the Durango’s advanced driver assists are optional, not standard, although some buyers might appreciate the ability to decide for themselves if they want these features. And while the Durango’s design is getting up there in years, it still offers all the things families look for in an SUV, like comfort, style and safety. Just don’t look for stellar resale value.

These competitors also all come standard with advanced driver assists not even available on some Acadia trims. However, once you move to the better-equipped SLE and SLT trims, the price and content pretty much even out.
Kelley Blue Book has determined the 2020 GMC Acadia will hold strong 5-year residual values, better than the Ford Explorer but a few percentage points behind the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.

Driving the  2020 GMC AcadiaWe were pleasantly surprised when the latest-generation GMC Acadia came to market for 2017, the slightly smaller size and lighter weight translating into an SUV that is both nimble and well-suited to handle everything from country roads to long highway stretches. It has a rigid platform and a suspension system borrowed from Cadillac’s flagship CT6 sedan.
But there’s also a new AT4 model suitable for handling moderate off-road duties. Upgrade to the Acadia Denali and you’ll get Continuously Variable Ride Control that instantly adjusts individual shocks anywhere from soft to firm, depending on road conditions and driver input. That’s a real plus, whether dodging potholes, handling tight corners or hammering the throttle on an open highway.
Buyers looking for maximum mileage will opt for the gas-stingy 2.5-liter inline-4, but for better performance and towing, opt for the 3.6-liter V6. A third choice new for 2020 is the 230-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo-4 that splits the difference in horsepower and fuel economy between the two.
RELATED: Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
Interior ComfortAlthough its absolute scale isn’t as large as the first-generation SUV, the 2020 Acadia’s cabin boasts an even more upscale character helped by a modern design that includes soft-touch surfaces, upgraded trim and active-noise cancellation.
Despite a wheelbase that matches the compact 5-passenger GMC Terrain, the Acadia’s architecture still allows for three adult-accommodating rows of seats. The second tier — 60/40 bench or captain’s chairs — features an upgraded Smart Slide system for easier access to the 50/50 third row, and both fold flat to expand the 12.8 cubic feet of base cargo space to a quite usable 79.0-cubic-foot maximum.
Exterior StylingThe 2020 GMC Acadia crossover SUV lives up to the company’s “Professional Grade” mandate. It’s a handsome vehicle with more of a modern, urban look than that of traditional SUVs. That starts with the bold, chromed grille and fascia treatments, as well as wheel arches that are more muscular-looking than those used by its Chevrolet sibling.
If you want an even bolder look, both inside and out, consider the Acadia Denali, with its distinctive lighting, 20-inch alloy wheels and a dollop of extra chrome. The AT4, on the other hand, offers more rugged off-road looks with the equipment to back it up.
Favorite FeaturesCONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE RIDE CONTROL
The CDC Real Time Damping system employs shocks filled with magnetic fluid that can instantaneously adjust to either soften or firm up the ride. Available only on the Denali trim, the system automatically adapts to road conditions and driver input, making independent changes at each corner in the time it takes to travel just two inches at 60 mph.
AT4
Adapted from last year’s All-Terrain package, the AT4 comes standard with the 3.6-liter V6 engine, twin-clutch all-wheel drive, 17-inch wheels with all-terrain tires, unique styling cues and Hill Descent Control.
Standard FeaturesEven the base Acadia SL comes with tri-zone auto climate control, a 7.0-inch color touch screen, keyless open and start, 5-year OnStar, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, five USB ports and the rear-seat reminder safety-alert system to prevent kids and valuables from being left behind.
Moving up through the SLE/SLT ranks introduces everything from a power liftgate, 8-inch touch screen with IntelliLink and SiriusXM Satellite Radio to leather upholstery, Bose audio and navigation.
The Denali and AT4 add distinctive cosmetic/convenience touches plus a full range of driver assists. New features for 2020 on several trim levels include a more powerful wireless charging pad, LED front lighting and a digital rear-vision camera.
Factory OptionsThe Acadia’s extras roster relates to its trim grade, with no AWD available on the entry-level SL. But the SLE-1 can be had with that, a V6 and a rear-seat entertainment system, while the SLE-2 offers Bose sound, upgraded infotainment and the Dual SkyScape 2-panel panoramic sunroof.
It offers a Driver Alert Package I that brings Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Rear Park Assist, all of which are found in the Denali’s more comprehensive — and standard — Driver Alert Package II that adds Pedestrian Detection and Forward Collision Alert with Low-Speed Automatic Braking.
Engine & TransmissionUnlike many competitors, the 2020 GMC Acadia SUV offers buyers a choice of three engines. Standard on the SL and SLE is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 194 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque.
Next up is an all-new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder standard on SLT and Denali trims. This mighty engine pumps out a respectable 230 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque.
Last, there is a 310-horsepower 271-lb-ft-of-torque 3.6-liter V6 that is standard on the AT4 and optional on all but the base SL. The V6 also features Active Fuel management that cuts fuel to two of the six cylinders under light load.
A 9-speed automatic is the only transmission choice and all-wheel drive can be ordered on all but the base SL. Tow rating with the base engine remains a meager 1,000 pounds, but rises to 4,000 pounds with the V6 and AWD.

GMC vehicles are often swisher than their Chevy counterparts — especially at the Denali level, which puts the Acadia close to luxury marques.

The Acadia provides lots of interior space in a convenient midsize SUV/crossover footprint. And there’s the choice of second-row captain’s chairs for even greater comfort.
#3. Refined ride
The Acadia has essentially the same suspension as the Cadillac CT6 luxury sedan, providing a cushioned yet controlled ride.
#4. Three-zone automatic climate control
When there are several passengers on board, this standard feature (typically found in luxury vehicles) keeps heads cool and relations warm.

Overview
General Motors is trying to target the “right-size” SUV buyer by offering family-friendly crossover SUVs that can carry a full complement, yet are not so gargantuan that they guzzle fuel and barley fit into parking spaces. Enter the 2020 GMC Acadia, a 5-, 6- or 7-passenger SUV priced to compete with the Honda Passport, Ford Explorer and Dodge Durango, but with styling and features that push it closer to luxury brands like the Acura MDX and Lincoln Aviator.
The Acadia also offers a number of engine choices as well as front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). There’s even an off-road trim package appealing to those who like to venture far from the paved road.

1.6-liter engine works hard when Versa has a full load of people",20000,"Nissan has managed to keep the price in the teens while improving the Versa in just about every area. Versa competitors include the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio, Toyota Yaris and Mitsubishi Mirage. The Hyundai Accent, for the record, has a slight edge over the Nissan Versa in fuel economy, with EPA rating: 33 mpg City/41 mpg Highway/36 mpg Combined. The new Versa is plenty impressive, however, with EPA ratings of 32/40/35.
 2020 Nissan Versa PricingThe 2020 Nissan Versa S, the base model equipped with 15-inch steel wheels and a 5-speed manual transmission, starts at $14,730. Fitted with the CVT, a Versa S begins at $16,400.
A 2020 Nissan Versa SV – with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, 16-inch alloy wheels, and a safety suite that includes a blind-spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert – starts at $17,640. The SV that KBB drove recently, with $395 Scarlet Ember paint, $210 floormats, and the $895 destination charge, totaled $19,140.
The top new Versa, the SR, equipped with LED headlights, automatic climate control, unique seat fabric, a remote starter, a 6-speaker stereo, a dark chrome grille, and 17-inch alloy wheels, has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $18,240. With active cruise and the destination fee, the SR is $19,435 — a lot of car for less than $20,000.
If you can afford the extra coin, we recommend the Versa SR. It looks the best, has the most content, and it’s the only new Versa available with intelligent cruise control. While we know a few grand at the entry level has the potential to be a deal-breaker, the Versa SR brings extra safety hardware and amenities into the realm of the sub-$20,000 subcompact sedan.
Although the new Versa is undercut in price by the Mitsubishi Mirage, the Nissan is a far more substantial car that’s priced competitively with the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Toyota Yaris, the last having an edge over the earlier Nissan Versa in resale values. As always, check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new 2020 Nissan Versa.

Driving the  2020 Nissan VersaThe new Versa is 1.6 inches longer and 1.8 inches wider than the 2019 version, with a roof that’s 2.3 inches lower. When you shut the new Versa’s doors, there’s none of the tinny sound associated with the previous model. The 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine starts with the push of a button and settles into a pleasantly smooth idle. Drive is engaged via a conventional PRNDL lever that doesn’t confuse anybody.
Although you won’t be overwhelmed by the acceleration provided by the little 122-horsepower Nissan engine, it does have 12 percent more power than last year’s powerplant. As long as you drive in a relaxed, sane manner, the CVT goes about its work in innocuous fashion, always finding the most efficient ratio. With aggressive throttle, though, the CVT does tend to “motorboat,” that condition in which engine rpm doesn’t correlate with vehicle speed. In these situations, the CVT “upshifts” near the 6,500-rpm redline, doing its best to mimic the shift behavior of a conventional automatic transmission. At 80 mph on the freeway, the Versa engine is running at a relaxed 2,000 rpm.
On the road, the new Versa is impressively quiet, and the body doesn’t lean as much as it used to in corners. Credit the significantly lowered chassis, along with the added width and revised suspension featuring a beefier torsion-beam rear axle. For the record, the Versa brakes, which feature 10.4-inch front rotors and 8-inch rear drums, look positively tiny inside the SV model’s 16-inch alloy wheels. Nevertheless, they delivered dependable stopping power in our day full of mildly aggressive driving.
Additionally, we’re happy to report that the Versa’s electric-assist steering does not feel over boosted, and that Nissan saw no need to fit its small sedan with an automatic start/stop system, which may save some fuel but has the potential to disrupt the Versa’s impressively smooth driving experience. Last, we like how the flat bottom of the Versa’s standard urethane steering wheel looks sporty while also providing a bit of extra space for the driver’s thighs.
Interior ComfortLike the exterior, the interior of the 2020 Nissan Versa is a huge improvement. The seats are supportive and all-day comfortable, and there’s enough headroom up front for a driver 6-foot-5 inches or shorter. While the plastics used in the dash and door panels are hard, they’re textured in such a way as to look higher grade.
The instrument panel on the Versa SV that KBB tested features an analog speedometer on the right and a highly configurable thin-film transistor (TFT) display screen on the left. This screen can serve as a tachometer or as a panel to display other information like tire pressures, average fuel economy, and radio stations. In general, the presentation of information is very clear in the new Versa, and the various switches on the steering wheel are easy to use.
While five people can fit in the new Versa, four adults fit comfortably inside this subcompact Nissan sedan. Two additional points worth noting: The sloping roofline reduces rear headroom a fair amount, and the rear bench seat of the Versa S with the 5-speed manual transmission does not fold forward to increase the vehicle’s cargo capacity, as it does in all other versions of the new Versa. The trunk, at 15.0 cubic feet, is about the same size as before.
Exterior StylingWe think Nissan has done an excellent job of giving the Versa a strong family resemblance to its Altima and Maxima sedans, with wheels that fill the wheel wells much better than before. Nissan says the new Versa has an “Emotional Geometry” design language that features a “V-Motion” grille, boomerang-shaped headlights and taillights, kick-up C-pillars, and a “floating” roof created by some strategically placed black trim on said roof pillars. Details aside, the 2020 Nissan Versa is a handsome new design with a flowing roofline and an impressively low drag coefficient of 0.29.
The S model, the top Versa, looks particularly good, highlighted by its black chrome grille, its small rear spoiler, and its 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. Eight colors are offered on the new Versa, including three premium offerings: Electric Blue Metallic, Monarch Orange Metallic, and Scarlet Ember Tintcoat.
Favorite FeaturesAUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING
Standard on all 2020 Nissan Versas, Automatic Emergency Braking – complemented by pedestrian detection – is a potential lifesaver. In reverse, the new Versa also will apply its brakes if something is detected in the car’s path.
7-INCH COLOR DISPLAY
All new Nissan Versas have a 7-inch color touch screen stylishly integrated into dash at the top of the center stack. This screen works beautifully with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are standard on the SV and SR models.
Standard FeaturesIn addition to Automatic Emergency Braking with pedestrian detection, the 2020 Nissan Versa is a well-equipped subcompact sedan. Notable highlights include power windows, a push-button starter, cruise control, rear automatic braking, a 7-inch infotainment screen, lane-departure warning, and 15-inch steel wheels with covers.
The Versa SV and Versa SR models up the equipment ante with 16- and 17-inch alloy wheels, respectively, while also having Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Safety Shield 360, a safety suite that features blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Automatic climate control is standard only on the top Versa, the SR.
Factory OptionsThere aren’t many options on the 2020 Nissan Versa. If you want a premium paint color (Electric Blue Metallic, Monarch Orange Metallic, Scarlet Ember Tintcoat) on your new Versa SV or SR, it’s available as a $395 option.
The other notable option, available only on the Versa SR, is a $300 Convenience Package that includes active cruise control and heated front seats.
Engine & TransmissionWhile the Versa engine remains a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder, it’s a now a Generation 3 powerplant with a sharpened focus on fuel economy and reduced emissions. In addition to dual fuel injectors per cylinder, the Versa engine has variable cam timing on the intake and exhaust sides. This aluminum-block powerplant puts out 122 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and 114 lb-ft of torque at 5,400 rpm, which compares favorably to last year’s levels of 109 horsepower and 107 lb-ft.

All-new vehicle with “Junior Altima” styling and improved interior
Lower, wider and stronger chassis with reduced body-to-tire gaps
Automatic emergency braking is standard on all Versas
Active cruise control available on the top SR model

The Nissan Versa has undergone a major transformation for the better. What used to be a dowdy-looking subcompact sedan and darling of rental fleets, has matured into an attractive vehicle with a strong family resemblance to the new Altima. While the new Versa still has an efficient 1.6-liter engine mated to a CVT, this subcompact sedan benefits from a more robust chassis, improved interior materials, and standard safety technology that includes automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist. Heck, you can even order active cruise control on the top-of-the-line SR, a model that still has an MSRP of below"

Driving the  2020 Jeep WranglerWhen driven off the beaten path, there aren’t a lot of surprises with the 2020 Jeep Wrangler, and that’s a good thing. What would be a challenge for most SUVs like rocks, muddy fields, and even rushing water is easy for the Wrangler to conquer.
You don’t need to upgrade to one of the more expensive trims for the Wrangler to be an excellent off-roader, but it does make this SUV more adventurous. The rugged Rubicon model adds more undercarriage protection, beefier all-terrain tires, the Rock-Trac 4×4 system, an Off-Road+ mode, and much more.
As for on-road driving manners, the Jeep Wrangler is more civilized than ever. Compared to previous generations, the ride is more comfortable, and the interior is more modern. We also like the range of engines from the sturdy standard V6 to the turbocharged inline-4 to the torquey and efficient EcoDiesel V6.
Further evidence that the Wrangler hasn’t lost any of its character is that it’s still ready for open-air fun. You can take off the top and the doors and fold down the windshield if you want that wind in your hair experience that few other SUVs can offer.
Interior ComfortThe inside of the Jeep Wrangler has gotten nicer, but it still has a distinct charm. The two different body styles of the Wrangler provide two different interiors. The 2-door model has two seats in the back, and the 4-door Unlimited models have a more spacious rear bench seat with three seats, plus a lot more cargo space.
The interior design is simple and somewhat minimalist. The base trim is pretty spartan, but as you work your way up the model range, the Wrangler can get pretty nice with modern features like heated seats, navigation, and a leather-wrapped dash.
Exterior StylingThe Jeep Wrangler is identifiable from a mile away. It still has its distinct shape and face with its round headlights and 7-slot grille. It’s a bit bigger than its predecessors, but the 2-door model is still decidedly compact. We love that Jeep mainstays like removable doors, a folding windshield, and soft- or hardtop roof options are still there.
The doors are easier for one person to remove and replace than you might expect. You have a choice of an easy-to-fold soft-top or two different hardtops — one with a power-retractable cover and another with two removable panels.
Favorite Features3 AVAILABLE ENGINES
The base V6 is a trusty engine that’s well-suited for on-road driving and off-road adventuring. The turbocharged 4-cylinder yields better fuel economy and more torque than the base V6. The EcoDiesel V6 gives you a ton of torque while being the most efficient engine available in the Wrangler.
MODERN INTERIOR
This is the first generation of the Wrangler that feels like a modern SUV on the inside. The front seats are comfortable, while the back of the Wrangler Unlimited is plenty roomy. Don’t worry; if you still want a rubber floor, you can hose down, that’s still available.
Standard FeaturesThe base Jeep Wrangler Sport has a standard gas-powered V6 linked to a 6-speed manual transmission and the Command-Trac 4×4 system. This is an old-school Jeep that does not include power windows, air conditioning, nor a modern infotainment system as standard equipment. If you’re a Jeep purist, this is probably a good thing, but if you’re looking for a more modern SUV, you’ll probably want to skip the base trim. The base Unlimited Sport model is similarly appointed, but with a 4-door body and more interior space.
Factory OptionsThe Wrangler lineup has plenty of variety with different engines, transmissions, and trim levels available. You can get an automatic transmission with the base V6 engine or upgrade to a turbocharged inline-4 or the EcoDiesel V6. However, the diesel is only available in Unlimited models.
The mid-range Sport S trim adds some basic creature comforts absent from the Sport trim like power windows, keyless entry, and air conditioning. The Unlimited-only Sahara trim makes the rugged Wrangler a bit more premium with a 7-inch infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, dual-zone automatic climate control, and more options like leather seats and navigation become available. Finally, the Rubicon models are for the serious off-road nut with beefier all-terrain tires, the Rock-Trac 4×4 system with a 2-speed transfer case, Off-Road+ mode, and more.
Engine & TransmissionThere are three engines available under the hood of the 2020 Jeep Wrangler, and 4-wheel drive is standard on every model. The base engine is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 making 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard, and an 8-speed automatic is optional.
There’s a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine available, which only comes with an automatic transmission. It makes 268 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque while burning less gas than the base V6.
The base V6 and turbo-4 are both available with an eTorque mild-hybrid system that replaces the traditional alternator with an electric motor/generator. eTorque can provide extra torque in low-speed acceleration while saving a little fuel.
Finally, a 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6 is available in Unlimited models. This diesel makes 260 hp and a whopping 442 lb-ft of torque, which can really come in handy in off-road adventures. This is also the most efficient engine available in the Wrangler.

The 2020 Jeep Wrangler is a modern SUV that hasn’t forgotten its roots. You can still expect the incredible off-road capability that its “Trail Rated” badges promise while getting an SUV that’s comfortable enough for the daily commute.
With standard 4-wheel drive on every trim, the Jeep Wrangler is ready for just about anything nature throws at it, whether it’s traversing a snowy road or climbing a mountain. It can also offer a level of luxury that might surprise you in the upper trims.
Engine options include a standard Pentastar V6, a turbocharged inline-4 with an eTorque mild-hybrid system, and an efficient EcoDiesel V6. It’s one of the few SUVs that is still available with a manual transmission.

The high-performance SRT model comes in right around the $70k mark, and if you want the supercharged Trackhawk, it starts at just under $90k.
The Grand Cherokee’s starting price is a little higher than some other midsize 2-row SUVs like the Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe. Part of the reason for that is the standard V6 engine under the hood of the Jeep, while many competitors have a standard 4-cylinder.

Driving the  2020 Jeep Grand CherokeeThe Jeep Grand Cherokee’s calling card has always been blending on-road comfort with off-road capability, and that’s no different for the 2020 model. This SUV has excellent road manners both around town and on the highway. If you only drive the Grand Cherokee on pavement, it might surprise you what it can do when the pavement ends.
The Quadra-Trac I, Quadra-Trac II (adds a 2-speed transfer case), and Quadra-Drive II (adds an electronic limited-slip rear differential) 4-wheel-drive systems all turn the Grand Cherokee into a more capable off-roader than almost all of its direct competitors. Meanwhile, the available Quadra-Lift air suspension system can turn up the ground clearance as high as 10.8 inches and provides a smooth ride on the street.
On-road performance depends on which of the four engines you choose. Most Grand Cherokees are equipped with a Pentastar V6, which delivers a satisfying blend of performance and efficiency. Upgrading to the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 gives this SUV some extra muscle and can tow up to 7,200 lbs. To really turn up the heat, the 392 Hemi V8 in the SRT model pumps out 475 horsepower, and the bonkers Trackhawk with a supercharged V8 sourced from the Dodge Hellcat muscle cars produces 707 horsepower.
Interior ComfortWhen you think of the base trim of a Jeep, you probably think of a bare-bones SUV. This is not the case with the 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The base Laredo model is a nice SUV with a comfortable interior and modern tech. Move up the model range, and you’ll find premium features like Laguna leather seats, a panoramic roof, advanced safety tech, and more.
The Grand Cherokee can only be had with two rows of seats. It’s comfortable for the front-seat occupants, and the cargo hold is pretty spacious, but the back seats aren’t as roomy as you’d think for an SUV this size.
Exterior StylingThe 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee has an aesthetic that is in line with its character. It looks rugged yet classy with a distinct Jeep look. It’s boxier than most rivals, and the ground clearance is generous, but not extreme.
The look of the Grand Cherokee can change quite a bit depending on which trim you choose. For example, the Trailhawk has an off-roady look with red tow hooks and a matte black hood stripe, the premium Overland and Summit models use more chrome, and the high-performance SRT and Trackhawk trims have a lower stance and more aggressive front end.
Favorite FeaturesPERFORMANCE MODELS
With the off-road-ready Trailhawk, high-performance SRT, and mind-blowing Trackhawk in its ranks, the 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee has a versatile model range for a wide variety of drivers.
QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION
Quadra-Lift is one of the many things that set the Grand Cherokee apart from the competition. It can lower itself for easier access or raise itself for greater ground clearance, which translates to more possibilities off-road.
Standard FeaturesThere are many trims and tons of options for the 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but the base Laredo trim is fairly well appointed. Standard features include a Pentastar V6 engine, dual-zone climate control, a 7-inch Uconnect infotainment system, and some safety tech like blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a backup camera with rear parking sensors.
Factory OptionsWhether you’re looking for better off-road chops, stronger on-road performance, or just a nicer SUV, you’ll find it in the model range of the 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee. There are three V8 engines and three 4-wheel-drive systems available, giving the Grand Cherokee plenty of mechanical variety. As for tech features, you can get a bigger 8.4-inch touchscreen with more features like navigation. There are also multiple safety tech packages available that add automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control, parallel park assist, and more.
Engine & TransmissionThe vast majority of 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee models are equipped with either the base 3.6-liter V6 or the available 5.7-liter Hemi V8. The V6 is the most affordable and efficient option, and it provides enough grunt for the needs of most drivers. However, the most affordable V8 option adds some extra muscle and more towing capacity.
The SRT model employs a 6.4-liter V8 making 475 horsepower, and the Trackhawk borrows a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 from the Dodge Charger and Challenger Hellcat to make 707 horsepower.
V6-equipped Grand Cherokee models are available with rear-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive, while all V8 models have 4WD. Every Grand Cherokee sends power to the wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission.

#11 in Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
The “WK2” platform of the Jeep Grand Cherokee is getting toward the end of its life cycle in the 2020 model year, but it is still a compelling midsize 2-row SUV that can appease a wide range of SUV shoppers. As you may have guessed, it has an edge over most of its competitors in off-road capability when equipped with one of its multiple available 4-wheel-drive systems.
The Grand Cherokee is good at much more than off-roading. If it’s on-road performance you crave in the form of a practical SUV, then you’ll find a lot to love in this Jeep. There are three different V8 engines available under the hood and two distinct high-performance trims; the SRT and the insane 707-horsepower Trackhawk.

What's New?
2020 Chevrolet Corvette is all-new
Marks 8th-generation Corvette
First mid-engine Corvette in history
All-new 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission

The 2020 Corvette marks a sea change for Chevrolet’s iconic 2-seat sports car. After more than 60 years of having a V8 up front powering the rear wheels, the 2020 Corvette Stingray finally, officially, becomes what driving enthusiasts have been desiring for decades: a mid-engine layout. This puts the Corvette on terms with Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens and Porsches.
While the previous Corvette was hardly a slouch, Chevrolet had reached the limits of extraction. Placing the engine in the middle puts more weight over the rear wheels, which enhances acceleration, grip and overall balance. The 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray can do 0-60 mph in less than three seconds and hit a top speed of 194 mph, all while feeling more balanced when thrown into turns.
Yet the Corvette still manages to be livable and quite comfortable for daily commutes. Then there’s the striking design. As either a coupe with a removable roof panel or a convertible, the 2020 Corvette might just be mistaken for an Italian exotic. Perhaps most shocking is the new Corvette’s starting price. Chevy has managed to keep it under $60,000. That’s far, far below the supercars it can now call true rivals, and still significantly less than a Porsche 911 or Acura NSX.
 2020 Chevrolet Corvette PricingThe all-new Corvette Stingray has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), starting at $59,995 — and that’s including the $1,095 destination charge. The new Corvette Stingray Convertible begins $7,500 higher than the coupe, at $67,495. Climbing trims and adding options can push these prices into the $80,000 range.
Yet for what it is — a new mid-engine high-performance sports car, the new Corvette is a bargain. Moreover, even with its radical shift, the new Vette begins only a few thousand above that of the outgoing model. Compared with other mid- and rear-engine supercars, the Corvette’s price looks even more tempting.
When factoring the destination charge, these days a Porsche 911 starts around $99,000 — or let’s just round up and say $100,000. In fact, the Porsche Cayman is far closer in price, yet is down nearly 200 horsepower to the Vette. Ferraris and Lamborghinis are in a league of their own, with prices easily topping $250,000. McLarens, too, sit over the $200,000 mark. The Acura NSX, which uses a sophisticated powertrain that combines a mid-engine V6 and three electric motors, is about $160,000, while an Audi R8 starts over $171,000.
Before buying what could be the best thing to ever enter your garage, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The new 2020 Corvette’s resale value is still being determined, as this vehicle is brand-new to the market.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet CorvetteThe outgoing, 7th-gen (C7) Corvette was the best-handling to date. The new C8 is even better. Out the gate, even the base Stingray shaves nearly a second off the former’s 0-60-mph time. When equipped with the Z51 Performance Package — and yes, you’ll want this $5,000 package — the new 2020 Corvette will hit 60 mph in less than three seconds. And we’ve already mentioned it will chase a top speed of nearly 200 mph. Remember, this is a car that starts at $60,000.
The Corvette still uses a big, naturally aspirated V8 engine. No turbos means no turbo lag. Instead, you just get an immediate answer to what your right foot asks. Acceleration is exhilarating, made all the better by the sounds of the Corvette’s exhaust and the sense of that V8 rumbling behind your back. Steering feel is precise, well-controlled and nicely weighted.
For all its performance, the reality is that most Corvettes will spend much of their lives living on ordinary roads with ordinary cars. We’re happy to report that Chevy’s new star athlete makes even the most of mundane commutes. When not being flogged, the 2020 Corvette’s ride quality is quite comfortable. Switch the drive mode from Sport or Sport+ to Tour, and the vehicle relaxes itself and its entire driving character. Further refinement and attitude adjustment can be had via the optional magnetic ride control, a $1,895 option.
If there’s one ingredient that’s missing compared to prior Corvettes, it’s a manual transmission. All new 2020 Stingrays use an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic. The switch isn’t a huge surprise given buyer preference for automatics, and the new one in the C8 Vette does a great job. Shifts are smooth and seamless, and the DCT easily puts the Corvette’s nearly 500 horsepower to the ground. Of course, steering-wheel paddle shifters are present should you want to control when shifts occur.
Interior ComfortAs before, the Corvette retains simply two seats — one for driver, one for passenger. But as with everything else about the new Corvette C8, its cabin is radically different from every model before it. If there were ever a “driver-focused” cockpit, this is it. Just about everything is canted toward the driver, including the 8-inch infotainment screen.
One of the most polarizing elements of the new Corvette is the long spine of buttons that nearly encroach into the passenger side. They operate climate controls, including the available seat heat/ventilation. It can look confounding at first, but is easier to learn and operate than we expected, with indentations that your fingers will learn over time. Yet there’s no denying that the panel that houses all the buttons and its rising side can make the passenger feel isolated.
Back on the driver’s side, there is a good amount of space to work, and we found the seats comfortable for the haul. Another pleasant surprise is the squared steering wheel inspired by race cars. Its shape acts as a frame for the standard 12-inch digital instrument cluster. Also new are the transmission controls. Instead of a traditional gear, you’ll press a button to get into Drive, Park, Neutral and Reverse. The optional Rearview Camera Mirror can turn from glass into a rearview monitor that provides a real-time, uninhibited rear view.
As for storage space, it’s actually not bad. Despite the engine moving to the rear, there’s enough room in the trunk for two sets of golf clubs.
Exterior StylingYour eyes can judge as easily as ours, but we think the new 2020 Corvette Stingray is stunning. Its design looks far, far more expensive than its actual price. With the move to a mid-engine design, the Corvette now enjoys the strong rear, muscular architecture that houses its heart. Its nose remains appreciably long, and the rest of its composite body is a canvas for sculpted sides, air intakes and other bits that scream of its performance potential. The roof features a “double-bubble” design, and on Corvette Stingray Convertible models it can retract at speeds up to 30 mph and in as few as 16 seconds.

Whether you opt for the Corvette Coupe or Corvette Convertible, you can get an open-air experience. That’s because the Coupe’s body-color roof panel can be removed. If you want an even easier and quicker way to wind in your hair, opt for the Convertible with its power-folding hardtop
Standard FeaturesThe new Corvette C8 Stingray arrives in three trims: 1LT, 2LT and 3LT. The base 1LT form includes 8-way-power seats covered in leather, keyless access with push-button start, dual-zone climate control, and removable body-color roof panel. The standard infotainment system is an 8-inch touch-screen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, 10-speaker Bose audio system, plus a 12-inch digital instrument cluster that can be configured to your liking.
We think the 2LT model is even more recommendable, and adds premium amenities like heated/ventilated seats, heated steering wheel, blind-spot monitoring, navigation, head-up display, the slick Rear Camera Monitor, a Performance Data Recorder, 14-speaker Bose audio, and wireless phone charging.
Factory OptionsAt the top of the lineup, Corvette 3LT models add GT2 seats in upgraded leather, and extend the use of leather and suede on the inside. Optional and recommended on all trims is the Z51 Performance Package (see Favorite Features). Other options are extensive and range from a front-suspension lift system that can save the front end from scrapes, to Magnetic Ride Control suspension, an array of exterior paint colors and wheel options, and even the color of the brake calipers and seatbelts.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2020 Corvette continues to use a 6.2-liter small-block V8 engine, now dubbed the LT2. With its pushrod configuration, it has some old-school traits — no dual-overhead cams here. Yet it’s been revamped to remain relevant and satisfying in its new home. The engine now makes 490 horsepower out of the gate, a 35-horse bump over the previous model. Checking the option box for the performance exhaust (included in the Z51 package), increases that number to 495 horsepower.
The engine continues to power the rear wheels. The sole transmission is an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Corvette has various drive modes, including Sport, Touring and Z-Mode, which allows individualized driver settings.
The engineering versatility in the C8’s design makes this car a peek into the near future. It may not seem it at first, but a modular, mid-engine design like the new Corvette allows a vastly greater variety of powertrains and hybrid systems than traditional front-engine designs. In an age where electrical connections are increasingly replacing mechanical ones, the C8 is primed to be GM’s testbed for new technologies as they become available.

Naturally, it doesn’t have the ultimate capability of a full-size pickup",21300,"The LT trim should be the sweetest spot of the range, though — with plenty of cab, bed and engine permutations — yet still beginning at $28,795. The upper reaches of the Colorado costs are home to more specialized versions such as the ZR2 off-roader variant, starting at $44,095. The turbocharged diesel engine is almost $7,000 extra in an LT, or $3,500 more in the ZR2. Get lavish with the options, and a diesel-powered ZR2 could easily approach $55,000.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabConsidering Chevy has been making pickups for decades and is one of the big names in trucks, it probably isn’t surprising to learn that the 2020 Colorado has a stable and well-planted ride, with sufficient punch even when the cargo bed is full. Although the base 4-cylinder gasoline engine has to work the hardest under such conditions.
The 2.8-liter diesel engine is a particularly smart choice for those seeking the best towing option as well as for buyers wanting optimum fuel economy. Its healthy torque output is also a boon when the tarmac ends and the Colorado driver goes off on a different adventure. The off-roading ZR2 is a well-engineered alternative to Toyota’s Tacoma TRD trucks. It’s designed to go rock-crawling over the weekend and then perform the usual commute during the week.
Interior ComfortDespite some cheaper-looking plastics in the lower parts of the cabin, the 2020 Colorado generally has that tough air of a truck that can carry out serious duties. This is also blended with tech features that can (depending on trim) include an 8-inch touch screen, smartphone integration and Wi-Fi.
The crew cab’s rear seats can split and fold, allowing for plenty of interior cargo space. There’s also a substantial stowage area beneath those seats. A pickup truck is meant to be super-useful and the Chevy Colorado sticks to that script.
Exterior StylingThe traditional body-on-frame truck construction approach brings specific benefits, such as towing abilities. These rugged bones translate to a muscular exterior design, underlined by a family resemblance to the bigger Silverado. The ZR2 off-roading model features a lifted suspension (for greater travel), wider track, revised bumpers and a skidplate.
The 2020 Colorado is available with an extended or a larger crew cab, while bed choices run to 5.1 feet and 6.2 feet. The smaller bed handles 41 cubic feet, the longer bed holds 50 cubic feet; only the Ford Ranger does better. And Ford had the advantage of using the Colorado as a benchmark.
Favorite FeaturesDURAMAX DIESEL
This turbocharged 2.8-liter engine is a gem. Muscular yet refined, it also achieves excellent fuel economy. An exhaust-braking feature enhances control on downhill stretches while reducing brake wear.
COLORADO ZR2
It probably starts in childhood, that desire to splash around in muddy puddles. And as we grow older, the wild landscape becomes bigger and more demanding. Luckily, our inner dust devil is well served by the ZR2, thanks to some serious off-road equipment including Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and additional under-body protection.
Standard FeaturesThere’s a version of the 2020 Colorado to suit almost any budget and set of demands. The base model comes with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, two USB ports, 7-inch infotainment display, 6-speed manual transmission, vinyl seat and floor covering, plus welcome features like the CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate and cargo-box lighting.
Work Truck models don’t offer much more, but become eligible for a greater number of options. The LT trim adds an 8-inch touch screen, 17-inch alloy wheels, leather-wrapped/tilt/telescope steering wheel, satellite radio and rear parking sensors.
The Z71 has some off-road equipment like a dedicated suspension setup, all-terrain tires and a locking rear differential, while the ZR2’s equipment list is even more specialized.
Factory OptionsMany items that are standard in higher trims of the 2020 Chevy Colorado range are optional further down the ladder, such as the EZ-lift tailgate, Wi-Fi and the remote-locking tailgate. From the Work Truck level upward, the Colorado can be ordered with a crew cab, all-wheel drive, and a choice of engines.
Other extras include a spray-in bedliner, 7-speaker Bose audio setup, fog lights, cargo-bed storage rails, and a low-speed transfer case for the all-wheel-drive system.
Engine & TransmissionA base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine motivates the Chevrolet Colorado with 200 horsepower. Rear-drive (RWD) versions link up to either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic; there’s no manual option with all-wheel drive (AWD).
This engine is okay for the purpose, but it’s worth spending extra to obtain either the 308-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 or the 2.8-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel for a more pleasurable driving experience.
The diesel makes 180 horsepower, but delivers the best torque of the 2020 Colorado range. And torque (that feeling of muscle when pressing the accelerator) is arguably the more important quality. It also results in the range’s highest towing figure and the best fuel-consumption figures: 23 mpg combined (RWD).
The 3.6 V6 connects to an 8-speed automatic transmission; the 2.8 diesel deploys a 6-speed automatic.

The 2020 Chevrolet Colorado is a midsize pickup truck, but that’s okay. Although full-size pickups (like the Colorado’s stablemate, the Chevy Silverado) tend to get most of the attention, there’s still a large and accommodating place in the pickup world for midsize trucks.
For many buyers, the Colorado has all the interior space they require, plus adequate cargo and towing capacities, performance and handling abilities, and several tech features. All at relatively reasonable prices. We’d recommend a mid-level trim, since the more expensive models might make a Silverado a better choice.
The midsize truck scene is expanding with the resurrected Ford Ranger, while an all-new Ram Dakota is due later in 2020. Other rivals include the ever-dependable Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and the Colorado’s re-badged sister — the GMC Canyon.

#9 in Best Small Luxury SUVs of 2020
Although the 911 is the company’s best-known model, the Macan is Porsche’s best-selling vehicle. As crossover SUVs gain in popularity, Porsche has been able to combine the versatile family utility of a compact SUV with the performance expected of the storied brand from Stuttgart, Germany.
To ensure maximum traction on all surfaces, the Macan comes standard with all-wheel drive, while power comes from a choice of turbocharged engines: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder for the base model, a 3.0-liter V6 for the Macan S, and a twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6 in the new 2020 Porsche Macan Turbo model, which returns to the lineup after a year-long hiatus.
The Porsche Macan is sportier than the Audi SQ5, BMW X3/X4 and Jaguar F-Pace, but it does come up comparatively short against those competitors in cargo space and off-road abilities.
RELATED: Best Small Luxury SUVs of 2020
 2020 Porsche Macan PricingThe 2020 Porsche Macan carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $50,900, plus a destination fee of $1,350. The Macan S starts at $60,750, while the Porsche Macan GTS and Macan Turbo begin much higher, at $71,300 and 83,600, respectively. Equipped with a bounty of options, a Macan Turbo can crack the $100,000 mark.
Consider a 2020 Porsche Macan Turbo that KBB recently sampled in Germany. Equipped with options such as a black leather interior ($1,890), a panoramic sunroof ($1,670), Adaptive Air Suspension ($1,390), Adaptive Cruise Control ($1,170), Park Assist ($1,200) and Lane-Keep Assist ($1,380), the Macan Turbo we drove was priced at $100,390. And when you throw in a Burmester surround-sound stereo ($5,700) and the Sport Chrono Package ($1,360), your Macan Turbo gets awfully close to $110,000.
As such, the Macan is among the priciest of the compact-luxury SUVs on the market. Before buying Porsche’s compact SUV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Macan’s resale value should be near the top of the segment, better than that of the Audi Q5/SQ5, BMW X3 or Lexus NX 300 F Sport.

Driving the  2020 Porsche MacanFrom behind its thick leather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel, the 2020 Porsche Macan is a delight, a wonderful blend of SUV and sports car. It’s one of the sportiest SUVs available, and it’s an engaging drive from the instant you fire up its turbocharged engine. Even the “slowest” model, the base Macan, is fast. This 4-cylinder model hits 60 mph in just over six seconds. The V6-powered Macan S shaves another second off that time, while the new Macan Turbo throws down the gauntlet with a blast to 60 in 4.3 seconds (or 4.1 when equipped with the Sport Chrono package).
Not long ago, that kind of performance was strictly 911 territory. Porsche’s all-wheel-drive system maximizes traction, and there’s enough cornering grip in the Macan to strain neck muscles. At the same time, Porsche’s compact SUV has a vault-like chassis and a comfortably smooth ride. Toss the Macan into corners and let the fun begin.
Interior ComfortThe Macan’s interior may not be as spacious or accommodating as some of its rivals, but few in this class can match this Porsche’s attention to detail, design and functionality. As is tradition in Porsche vehicles, the ignition is to the left of the steering wheel. Instrumentation is directly in the driver’s line of sight, with the tachometer taking center stage in the cluster, flanked by the speedometer and digital readout screen.
The center stack is dominated by a 10.9-inch touch-screen infotainment system, while a smaller steering wheel from the 911 is optional. Firm and well-bolstered front seats are designed with performance driving in mind, and although the button-heavy center console looks intimidating, it’s logically arranged. There’s 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 40/20/40 rear bench, an amount that increases to 53 cubic feet when the seat is folded.
Exterior StylingThe Porsche Macan SUV received a new look for 2019, and the compact SUV continues unchanged into 2020. The nose is highlighted by full LED headlights, while the rear boasts an LED taillight spanning the full width of the tailgate. The wheels and tires look like those used on the Cayenne SUV and Panamera sedan.
Standard wheels are 18-inchers (the best choice for those looking for a smooth ride) but the 20- and 21-inch wheels available on the Macan S and Macan Turbo models dramatically improve the visual appeal. Standard tires on the new Macan Turbo are size 265/45R-20 in front and 295/40R-20 in back.
Favorite Features10.9-INCH TOUCH SCREEN
In keeping with Porsche’s other vehicles, the Macan has a 10.9-inch touch screen that dominates the center dash. The touch-screen setup plays host to all infotainment features, navigation, rearview camera and apps integration plus available Apple CarPlay.
PORSCHE SURFACE-COATED BRAKES (PSCB)
The Macan Turbo’s brake discs are coated with tungsten carbide to dramatically reduce rotor wear and significantly cut the amount of brake dust deposited on the alloy wheels. (Although most people think brake dust is comprised primarily of spent pad material, Porsches says 70 percent of it comes from the rotor itself.)
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Porsche Macan is generously equipped. Besides the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, the base Macan is fitted with all-wheel drive, 18-inch wheels, a power tailgate, LED headlights, an anti-theft alarm and an interior featuring power front seats, four USB ports, tri-zone climate control and leather and Alcantara trim. A lane-departure warning system also is standard, as are cruise control and a split-folding rear seat. The infotainment system is highlighted by a 10.9-inch multi-touch screen with navigation.
As for the V6-powered Macan S, it has Sport and Off-Road modes, not to mention shift paddles and 19-inch wheels. The new 2020 Porsche Macan Turbo benefits from Porsche Active Suspension Management (air suspension), 20-inch wheels, larger brakes and a Sport exhaust with silver tailpipes. An analog clock also graces the dash of the Macan Turbo.
Factory OptionsPorsche offers extensive option packages for its Macan SUV. At $6,500, Premium Package Plus is by no means inexpensive, but it includes a huge panoramic sunroof, Apple CarPlay, a Bose Surround Sound audio system and heated 14-way-power front seats with memory. An available Premium Package includes the Bose stereo, Apple CarPlay and heated seats (but no panoramic sunroof) for $3,110.
A Sport Chrono Package is available as a $1,360 option. In addition to having an analog and digital stopwatch, Sport Chrono includes a Sport Plus mode for the engine, gearbox and chassis. Sport Chrono also includes a nifty Sport Response Button that quickly engages the Macan’s sportiest settings for 20 seconds, all at the touch of a button. A Launch Control program, which guarantees a fast start, also is a part of Sport Plus.
Porsche’s Surface-Coated Brakes (PSCB), which effectively eliminate brake dust, are a $3,490 option. Also available: Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB), which add $8,160 to the price of the Macan S and Macan Turbo.
Engine & TransmissionThe base Macan employs a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 248 horsepower. That’s enough power to zip this performance SUV from 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds (or 6.1 with the Sport Chrono package). At just over 4,000 pounds, this is the lightest Macan. The Macan S receives the same 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (348 horsepower) used in the Cayenne and Panamera, and enables 0-60-mph blasts of 5.1 seconds. This engine places the turbocharger in the valley between the engine’s cylinders for improved turbo response.
The 2020 Porsche Macan GTS is powered by a twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6 with 375 horsepower, while the new Macan Turbo gets 434 horsepower out of the same basic engine. The twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6s have a slightly shorter stroke than Porsche’s 3.0-liter V6.
All Macans use a 7-speed PDK automatic transmission and a sporty rear-biased all-wheel-drive system. For added fuel efficiency, the compact Porsche SUV also has an auto start/stop system that can be switched off if desired. Porsche, for the record, states that the Macan Turbo has a towing capacity of 5,291 pounds (with a braked trailer).

Driving the  2020 Ford EscapeThe Ford Escape comes with four engine options, including a 1.5-liter EcoBoost inline-3 making 181 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter EcoBoost that makes 250 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. There’s also a 2.5-liter hybrid making 200 horsepower and a plug-in hybrid that earns 102 MPGe combined and has an electric-only range of up to 37 miles.
Power in the 2.0-liter EcoBoost feels good. The engine has great pep; it’s a feisty little thing. The hybrid mates to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), but the EcoBoost gets a new 8-speed automatic transmission that pairs really nicely with the 2.0-liter. Shifts are smooth and well measured, and more importantly, it doesn’t have trouble finding the right gear. If you are looking for a little extra burst of power, paddle shifters come with the 2.0-liter engine. The 1.5-liter EcoBoost, on the other hand, lacks that zest and energy, feeling a bit lethargic. The weight reduction helps it over the previous generation, but when driving, one still feels this engine working overtime.
The hybrid 2020 Ford Escape pairs to an electronic CVT that we can’t complain about. It mimics the gear ratios of an automatic transmission nicely and lacks that usual rubber-band quality and droning noise of a lot of CVTs. Power comes on instantly and strongly with the hybrid, though we’d like to see paddle shifters on this engine option. The hybrid’s regenerative brakes enjoy a natural feel and aren’t a distraction when driving.
Note that AWD is available with the standard 2020 Escape Hybrid, but the plug-in hybrid Escape is only offered in front-wheel drive.
The electric power-assisted steering in any engine option feels effortless if a bit dead at center. However, the weight is decent, and it’s quite precise. Pick your poison with drive mode options on the Escape; there are five of them. Normal and Eco modes feel subdued but still dynamic, and Sport livens up the throttle response a bit. There are also modes for Slippery and Snow and Sand, even with the FWD Escape. AWD is an option for those looking for improved grip from all four corners.
The suspension on the Escape is all-new, including vibration-absorbing rear subframe mounts for a more comfortable ride. The Escape absolutely succeeds here. It’s wider and lower than the previous gen, so it doesn’t feel top-heavy, especially around corners. With 200 pounds gone, acceleration is quicker and feels nimbler. It has refined shocks, springs, and bushings and overall feels comfortable without being floaty or sloppy. The ride is surprisingly good — we’d even venture to say it’s punching above its class.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 Ford Escape compact SUV gets both longer and wider affording more cargo and passenger space inside. There’s enough room in the back for four bags of golf clubs. The center-stack design keeps things simple, but intuitive, with a nice balance of touchscreen and physical buttons. An 8-inch touch screen on the SE trim and above plays the starring role here. Interior materials err on the cheap side, however, including lots of hollow plastic and questionable-looking faux-wood grains. Seats are comfortable and visibility is excellent if a bit hampered by large C-pillars. The rotary shifter is greatly improved over the previous generation’s shifter, and there’s now a rear center armrest in the base S model.
Exterior StylingFor 2020 the Ford Escape sees a major redesign, so much so that it might be unrecognizable to some buyers. The front fascia imitates some European sports-crossover-SUV styling and the blue oval’s own Focus. Instead of making it unique, it appears more aerodynamic but also parodies a lot of competitors. The grille drops significantly with new slanted and slightly squinty headlights extending from the top corners. The body takes on a curvier, more athletic shape to help with fuel economy, especially in the hybrid iterations. Even the roof racks are low profile to cut wind resistance. The Escape’s stance gets lower and wider with the compact SUV’s revised dimensions.
Favorite FeaturesSECOND-ROW SLIDING SEATS
Compact SUVs aren’t known for their capacious interiors. The all-new 2020 Ford Escape combats that issue with a sliding seat that gives 2nd-row passengers added legroom. With the recline function and supportive seat cushions, the Escape becomes a great road-trip compact SUV.
CO-PILOT360
Ford’s suite of safety and driver-assist features comes standard across all trims and includes post-collision braking, pre-collision assist with automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist. Available features include parking assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go and lane-centering and an evasive-steering assist.
Standard FeaturesStandard features include a 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine mated to an excellent 8-speed transmission. The powertrain features five selectable drive modes for conditions such as Slippery and deep Snow and Sand. Ford’s Co-Pilot360 suite of driver-assist features, a 2nd-row slide seat, LED taillights, two smart USB charge ports and Wi-Fi hotspot all come on the base S trim.
Factory OptionsClimb up the compact SUV’s trim ladder and get extras such as a power lift-gate, panoramic sunroof, navigation, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go as well as parking assist. Leather seats, a B&O premium sound system, chrome exhaust tips, USB-A and -C charging ports, a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, as well as leather-trimmed sport contoured bucket seats are also included.
Engine & TransmissionOn the base S, SE and SEL trims, a 1.5-liter EcoBoost 3-cylinder engine comes standard and produces 180 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. This engine still feels a bit lackluster, though losing weight in the car overall helps it. We wish it felt more energetic. The 1.5-liter features a cylinder-deactivation system, which automatically shuts down one cylinder when cruising to conserve fuel, so that’s an upside here.
The SE Sport trim comes standard with the 2.5-liter hybrid setup. With 200 horsepower, this gas-electric powertrain is a great re-entry for the Escape into the hybrid space. Power never feels lacking, though we would have preferred paddle shifters on this option, especially since this is being touted as a Sport trim.
The 2020 Ford Escape plug-in hybrid has a similar powertrain as the standard hybrid, but a larger battery pack that enables up to 37 miles of electric-only range. Recharge times take between 10 and 11 hours on a standard 110-volt outlet, or under 3.5-hours on a 240-volt Level 2 line. Note that while the standard Ford Escape Hybrid is offered in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the Escape PHEV is FWD only.
Our favorite engine tested was the 2.0-liter EcoBoost four. This little hustler never disappointed nor lacked personality. Its 250 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque hungrily gobbled up the road with what felt like little effort. Available in AWD SEL and Titanium models, this is the engine to beat.

#8 in Best Compact SUVs of 2020
The completely redesigned 2020 Ford Escape drops 200 pounds and gains 2nd-row passenger space, making it best-in-class for the segment. A completely retuned suspension that gives the Escape a smooth and comfortable ride adds to its appeal. Co-Pilot360, Ford’s suite of driver-assistance features, now comes standard across all trims.
Four engine options, including a hybrid and plug-in hybrid, offer buyers a variety of solid powertrains. Exterior design language takes on a performance-crossover-SUV spin with sloping roofline and reimagined front fascia, but tends to the generic side, and a simple, economical, but intuitive interior full of tech pleases without fuss.

Driving the  2020 Nissan AltimaOnce upon a time, Nissan was considered the sportiest of Japan’s three biggest brands. Think Z, GT-R and 4DSC (4-door sports car). As of late, though, aside from some outright wild styling, Nissan’s mainstream cars and SUVs are as bland as a baked potato without butter and chives.
Maybe that’s why we’re surprised that the latest Altima is genuinely good to drive. Even when equipped with its standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, the car is reasonably zippy, fairly athletic and impressively compliant during the daily commute.
Of course, it all depends on which version you get. For this review, we focused on the popular Altima SV equipped with AWD, with a quick sampling of the SR VC-Turbo to see how well it performed.
How fast is the Nissan Altima?
The good news is that a standard Nissan Altima accelerates fast enough that you won’t feel like you’re holding up traffic. Response is a little sluggish right off the line, but then the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and the CVT play nice with each other. If you’re looking to assert authority out on the road, though, this isn’t the right engine for you.
Get into an Altima with the VC-Turbo engine, and this stylish family sedan adopts a more aggressive character. It’s quick, and introduces a throatier note to acceleration. The CVT is dissatisfying when you explore the car’s performance potential, though, and the SR’s paddle shifters don’t add much in terms of driver engagement.
Does the Nissan Altima get good gas mileage?
Thanks to impressive EPA ratings, the answer is yes. Plus, the gas tank is large enough to provide more than 600 miles of highway driving range if you get the Altima S, SV or SL.
The question is, then, does the Altima get good gas mileage in the real world? During our testing, the Altima SV AWD averaged 29.3 mpg, coming close enough to its official 30-mpg rating that we’re willing to say you can count on the standard 2.5-liter to deliver on expectations.
The VC-Turbo engine is another story. Based on the window sticker, you’re going to assume that you’ll get 29 mpg in combined driving. While we were unable to obtain a reliable real-world figure during our short drive in an Altima VC-Turbo, our experience during a 12-month test of a 2019 Infiniti QX50 shows that this engine is thirstier than its EPA rating leads you to believe.
How does the Nissan Altima handle?
Even in SV trim, with its standard suspension tuning, 17-inch wheels and all-season tires, the Altima is satisfying to drive. The steering wheel is a delight to hold in your hands, and it responds with precision to input. Likewise, the brakes prove effective and supply perfect pedal feel and modulation. The Altima is remarkably quiet in the city and suburbs, too.
But the real stars of this car’s driving dynamics are two brake-based technologies that improve the Altima’s ride and handling. Active Ride Control helps to smooth out the holes, cracks and bumps in the road, and it soaks up speed humps with ease. Intelligent Trace Control provides brake-induced torque vectoring to keep the Altima on the intended path of travel.
On the twisty sections of our driving route, the Altima SV proved itself calm, cool and collected — when going downhill. Heading up into the mountains, the car’s lack of power made the Altima SV less pleasurable to drive.
That’s where the SR VC-Turbo shines brightest. With its thick band of torque, larger wheels and tires, and stiffer suspension, it’s the Altima you want for back-road romps. And it benefits from the same brake-based ride and handling tech as other Altimas.

How does the Nissan Altima ride on the highway?
Feeling solid and secure at speed, the Altima SV supplies a good blend of ride comfort and compliance with reasonable feel for the road. Noise levels rise the faster you drive, mainly due to road roar coming up through the floor. Naturally, the sport-tuned SR VC-Turbo is stiffer, which will likely please the people who choose it.
Are the Nissan Altima’s driving-assistance systems helpful?
Based on our test-driving, the Altima’s Nissan ProPilot Assist is one of the better implementations of semi-autonomous Level 2 driving-assistance technology, providing smooth and refined operation. Additionally, the Nissan Safety Shield 360 package of safety systems operated as expected during our testing, but the forward-collision warning system can be somewhat sensitive when programmed to its Medium setting.

Is the Nissan Altima fun to drive?
Rather than call the Altima fun to drive, we’d characterize the car as enjoyable to drive. In other words, it can make you crack a smile, but you’re unlikely to giggle.
The best thing about driving the Altima SV is that it rewards smooth inputs with confidence-inspiring handling. Otherwise, it draws no undue attention to itself, which is a good thing for most people but mildly dissatisfying for people who like to drive.
The Altima SR VC-Turbo supplies robust acceleration and a greater feeling of athleticism, but it requires premium gas to make maximum power and is unlikely to return the kind of fuel economy Nissan claims it will.
Interior ComfortSeating up to five people and carrying up to 15.4 cubic feet of cargo, the 2020 Altima is smaller inside than class leaders, but remains a capable midsize family sedan. The interior is modern and technical in appearance, which some people might also call plain and simple. Limited color, upholstery and trim choices reflect either a lack of imagination on Nissan’s part, or a lack of budget.
Does the Nissan Altima have a nice interior?
Aside from plenty of hard plastic covering the lower half of the car’s cabin, the Altima’s interior features quality materials and robust switchgear. This is, however, a relatively simple and straightforward design, dressed up a bit for 2020 thanks to new Piano Black trim in most models. Versions with leather get an appealing layered wood-tone trim.
What Nissan Altima interior colors are available?
Nissan offers two interior colors for the 2020 Altima: Black and Gray. Fans of tan or other trendy colors like red, blue or shades of brown will need to shop elsewhere.
Are the Nissan Altima’s controls easy to use?
Thanks to clear markings, large buttons and knobs, and a logical layout, the Altima’s controls are easy to use. The large round gauges are outstanding, too, and a large button on the steering wheel provides quick access to the ProPilot Assist system.
The only minor quirks here are an engine start/stop button located on the center console instead of the dashboard, and dim orange backlighting for secondary controls at night, which makes them harder to see.
Is the Nissan Altima’s infotainment system easy to use?
Sitting high on the center of the dashboard as though somebody glued an iPad to it, the Altima’s NissanConnect infotainment system is easy to use. Its location makes it easy to reference while driving, and while some of the virtual buttons on the touch screen are tough to accurately activate on the fly, the system includes volume and tuning knobs as well as physical buttons to access radio, map and main menu screens.
Is the Nissan Altima comfortable?
Thanks to its Zero Gravity front-seat designs and standard 8-way-power driver’s seat adjustment, the Altima is comfortable for the driver. However, even with the wide range of adjustment, the seating position is fairly low, and that makes it harder to get into and out of the car.
Unfortunately, the front passenger has it worse. This seat does without a height adjuster, even in top-shelf Platinum trim. The cushions are still comfortable, of course, thanks to the Zero Gravity design. But plopping into it and hoisting yourself out of it isn’t much fun.
In the latest Altima, the back seat also feels like it is lower to the ground and less spacious than in the old Altima. And once you’re in, the seating position promotes slouching. Note, too, that air-conditioning vents are unavailable with S and SR trim.
Generally speaking, we think the previous-generation Altima, which also had Zero Gravity seat designs, was more comfortable front and rear.
Is the Nissan Altima’s cargo area useful?
Equipped with a 15.4-cubic-foot trunk, the Altima’s cargo space is typical for the segment, with some competitors offering more and some offering less. Nissan gets extra points for including an interior grip to use for closing the lid, which means you won’t get your fingers dirty when slamming the trunk closed.
What else should I know about the Nissan Altima?
With higher trim levels, a free 6-month trial of NissanConnect Premium Plus Services provides a range of helpful features.
Highlights include automatic collision notification, a way to find your car when you’ve forgotten where you parked it, remote operation of several vehicle functions through a smartphone app, and home voice-assistant integration. Safe-teen driving technology is also a part of the package, letting parents program alerts related to speed, curfew time and geographic boundaries.
Exterior StylingEquipped with a dramatic but not distasteful version of Nissan’s V-Motion grille design, the Altima makes a bold visual statement while deftly incorporating the car’s attractive headlights. Nissan’s boomerang-shaped design accents are present and accounted for, but they’re tastefully applied to the latest Altima.
Nissan also makes this midsize sedan look sporty without resorting to ridiculously oversized fake air intakes, simulated vents or oversized spoilers and air dams. Nicely played, Nissan.
Most cars look better with bigger wheels, and that’s true of the 2020 Altima. However, in order to get a size larger than the 17-inch machined-finish aluminum wheels, you need to choose the SR or Platinum trim, with or without the turbocharged engine. The split-spoke 19-inch wheels on those models look terrific, and give the angular Altima some attitude.
There are a couple of missteps with the design. First, when viewing the car in profile, the front door handle looks like it’s in the wrong spot, as though hot sun caused underlying adhesive to melt and it slid down the door a couple of inches. Clearly, Nissan purposely placed it on the character line that sweeps up from the front fender to meet the taillights. But the end result looks a little off.
The other oddity is what resembles an SUV skidplate below the rear bumper. This is supposed to be a racy-looking diffuser panel, but when it’s painted the same color as the car, or gray, it looks strange. It should be black on all versions of the car.
What Nissan Altima colors are available?
Nissan offers the 2020 Altima in nine different colors. Some are exclusive to certain trim levels, and the final three on this list all cost an extra $395.

Gun Metallic

Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE
Buy a Nissan Altima with the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, and you can equip it with all-wheel drive (AWD). The system sends up to half of the engine’s power to the rear wheels to improve traction and handling.
Keep in mind that the AWD option reduces horsepower from 188 to 182, and torque from 180 lb-ft to 178 lb-ft. The Altima AWD also takes a hit in fuel economy, sagging two mpg in combined driving compared to front-drive versions.
ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL
A standard feature on all 2020 Altimas, Active Ride Control helps to smooth out the ride over speed bumps and humps. In subtle fashion, it automatically adjusts engine torque and applies the brakes to reduce or eliminate the body motions that accompany these speed-control measures.
REAR-DOOR ALERT
When you load a child, pet or other item into the Altima’s back seat before turning on the engine and driving the car, the Rear Door Alert system activates. When you reach your destination, it will remind you that perhaps someone or something important is in the back seat, and you should check before leaving the car and walking away.
ZERO-GRAVITY FRONT-SEAT DESIGNS
Rooted in NASA research about how the human body reacts to zero gravity environments in space, Nissan designs the Altima’s front seats to reduce stress and fatigue while maximizing comfort. Whatever the company does, it works, and as a result the Altima is one of the most comfortable midsize cars you can buy — aside from the fact that it lacks a front-seat height adjuster.
PROPILOT ASSIST
ProPilot Assist is Nissan’s name for its adaptive cruise control and lane-centering assist technology. The adaptive cruise control automatically maintains a safe following distance from traffic ahead, and its stop-and-go capability helps relieve stress in heavy traffic. The lane-centering assist helps to keep the car centered in the middle of the lane.
DOOR-TO-DOOR NAVIGATION
Use a typical embedded navigation system in a modern car, and it will direct you straight to the intended destination. But what if you need to park some distance away from where you ultimately need to be?
That’s where Nissan’s Door-to-Door Navigation function comes in handy. After you’ve parked, whip out your smartphone, and the NissanConnect app provides you with walking directions to find your final destination.
Standard FeaturesFor 2020, the Nissan Altima is available in S, SR, SR VC-Turbo, SV, SL, Platinum, and Platinum VC-Turbo trim levels. Listed below, you’ll find the major differences between each version of the car.
What comes in the Nissan Altima S?
As is true of the base trim levels of most midsize sedans, the Altima S gives you everything you really need in a new family car and, as an added bonus, an 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. With its tiny little wheels, the Altima S might not look great, but that’s easy enough to solve through the aftermarket.
Highlights include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a hands-free text-messaging assistant, keyless entry with push-button and remote engine starting, and a forward-collision-warning system with automatic emergency braking. The Altima S also has Rear Door Alert, which is designed to remind you that you might have loaded a child, a pet, or something else of importance into the car before setting off on your most recent trip, so check before you lock up and leave.
What comes in the Nissan Altima SR?
We’re all in favor of the recent trend toward sporty and affordable sedans based on basic trim levels. Honda’s Accord Sport kicked it off years ago, and Nissan’s response is the Altima SR.
Equipped with a more sophisticated look and big, 19-inch aluminum wheels, the Altima SR looks the part. It also gets a useful sport-tuned suspension, somewhat useless transmission paddle shifters, and a long list of Nissan Safety Shield 360 driver-assistance and collision-avoidance systems.
What comes in the Nissan Altima SR VC-Turbo?
The Altima SR VC-Turbo costs a whopping $4,050 more than a standard SR, but you do get more than just the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. Nissan installs active noise cancellation, heated side mirrors and front seats, a power sunroof, and a handful of other upgrades to go along with the extra power.
What comes in the Nissan Altima SV?
The Altima SV has most of the equipment from the SR VC-Turbo, minus the engine and sporty bits but with a set of machined-finish 17-inch aluminum wheels.
To these features, the SV trim adds dual-zone automatic climate control with rear air vents and a handy remote intelligent climate-control system that lets you pre-condition the cabin temperature before driving the car. A heated steering wheel is also in the Altima SV, along with an automatic hold braking system that’s helpful in traffic.
Nissan’s ProPilot Assist technology is standard in the Altima SV. It’s a semi-autonomous driving-assist system with adaptive cruise control, stop-and-go capability, and lane-keeping and lane-centering assist.
What comes in the Nissan Altima SL?
Your ticket to leather seats is the Altima SL. Nissan dresses this version up with wood-tone trim, too, but without height adjustment, the 4-way-power front-passenger’s seat is a disappointment.
What’s not disappointing is the Altima SL’s infotainment system upgrade. It includes HD Radio, free trial subscriptions to NissanConnect services and SiriusXM traffic and Travel Link, a Bose premium sound system, and a navigation system with door-to-door directions via smartphone app. The SL also includes a traffic-sign recognition system.
What comes in the Nissan Altima Platinum?
The short answer: not much. In fact, the Platinum’s 19-inch aluminum wheels, upgraded interior lighting, memory for the driver’s seat and mirror preferences, and 360-degree surround-view camera ought to be an option package for the Altima SL. That would allow Nissan to reserve the Platinum trim name for the loaded version with the VC-Turbo engine.
What comes in the Nissan Altima Platinum VC-Turbo?
A VC-Turbo engine comes in the Platinum VC-Turbo, and with it, active noise cancellation. Otherwise, this version of the Altima is just like the standard Platinum.
Factory OptionsOne reason Nissan offers so many trim levels is because so few options are available. With a handful of exceptions, you choose the trim that has the content you want, decide whether or not you wish to upgrade with AWD or the VC-Turbo engine, and then select from a list of profit-padding factory- and dealer-installed accessories.
The first exception to this approach is extra-cost paint. For three of the fancier Altima colors, the charge is $395.
The second exception is the Driver Assist Package for the base Altima S. At $890, this is a worthy upgrade because it installs the Nissan Safety Shield 360 driving-assistance and collision-avoidance technologies. Considering that the purely cosmetic accessory illuminated kick plates for the doorsills cost almost half that amount, the Driver Assist Package is a genuine bargain.
The third exception is the Premium Package ($1,050) for the Altima SR. You might want this if you live where cold temperatures are common because it equips the car with heated front seats and heated side mirrors. Then, when summer returns, this package’s power sunroof lets the sunlight and warm temperatures flow in.
As is always true, prices may have changed since this review was published. Be sure to research current Nissan Altima prices on KBB.
Engine & TransmissionThe Altima’s standard 188-horsepower, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine provides good acceleration and impressive fuel economy. You should get to 60 mph in less than eight seconds, and travel a bladder-busting 600 miles or more on the highway.
A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is standard with this engine, and feeds the power to the front wheels. The CVT is relatively refined in operation, and features what Nissan describes as an adaptive shift controller and dynamic step shifting to make it sound and feel more like a traditional automatic. With the SR trim, it includes paddle shifters that are more for show than go.
Note that due to their larger 19-inch aluminum wheels, the SR and Platinum versions get slightly less fuel economy.

An all-wheel-drive system is optional with the standard 2.5-liter engine, making the Altima the first AWD sedan Nissan has ever sold in the U.S. Under normal conditions, the Altima operates in front-wheel drive (FWD). When slippery conditions or enthusiastic driving require it, the AWD system sends up to 50 percent of the engine’s power to the rear wheels.
Fuel economy takes a hit when you get AWD. And note that the bigger wheels on the SR and Platinum trim levels nibble at official EPA ratings, too.

Nissan’s variable-compression turbocharged (VC-Turbo) 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, reportedly a 2-decade engineering project, debuted as the standard engine in the 2019 Infiniti QX50 and as an option in the 2019 Altima SR and Platinum models.
So, what took 20 years to figure out? The VC-Turbo automatically changes its compression ratio depending on how you’re driving. When cruising on the highway, it adjusts to maximize fuel efficiency. When you’re accelerating hard, it adjusts to provide maximum performance.
The goal, according to Nissan, is to provide the power of a V6 engine with the fuel economy of a 4-cylinder engine. Last time we checked, that’s the goal of every turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.
The VC-Turbo replaced the Altima’s previous 3.5-liter V6, a creamy-smooth, free-revving delight of an engine. That engine made 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. The VC-Turbo engine, as long as you burn premium gas, delivers 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft. It also gets 29 mpg in combined driving, beating the old Altima’s V6 by three mpg.
As is always true, your results may vary. And since the VC-Turbo works harder in the real world than did the V6 engine, well, you might find this whole VC-Turbo thing to be a wash. But it scores a higher EPA number, and that, apparently, is what mattered.

#4 in Best Midsize Cars of 2020
Last redesigned for the 2019 model year, the Nissan Altima is a roomy and comfortable midsize sedan seeking to distinguish itself through design, technology and efficient performance.
That’s not easy, because the Altima’s competition is doing the same thing, and in many cases doing it better than the Nissan. Furthermore, as consumers abandon sedans for SUVs, the latest Altima likely won’t sell as well as those that came before it — in spite of Nissan’s investment in an all-new design.
With Chevrolet and Ford slowly abandoning car buyers, the Altima’s primary competitors include the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Hyundai has a redesigned 2020 Sonata that poses a serious threat, while the Kia Optima remains the impressive value it always has been.
Buick and Mazda offer compelling alternatives if you want to drive something different, and the roomy 2020 Volkswagen Passat gets a much needed refresh this year. Let’s not forget about the redesigned 2020 Subaru Legacy, either, which has standard rather than optional AWD as well as a new turbocharged-engine option.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet SonicAlthough it was introduced way back in 2012 and is old by automotive standards, the Sonic’s powertrain and driving manners remain competitive. As Chevy dropped the base 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine last year, that means all come with a small but peppy 1.4-liter turbo-4. Its 138 horsepower is enough to make the small Sonic feel spry. You won’t exactly be winning street races, but it’s more than adequate to hustle the Sonic up freeway onramps without fear of becoming a splat in a semi’s grille.
Where the Sonic most excels is around town and on shorter commutes. Its diminutive size and tight, 34.5-foot turning radius enable it to snake through traffic and squeeze into tight parking spots. The Sonic’s suspension and steering are on the more athletic side, more so if you opt for the sport suspension. Conversely, the Sonic isn’t as comfortable or refined as the all-new Nissan Versa.
Sadly, one aspect we really liked about past Sonics — an easy and engaging manual transmission — has been dropped for 2020. That leaves the Sonic’s formerly optional 6-speed automatic as standard. If you are among the “save the manuals” crowd and are looking for a small and economical car, check out the Honda Fit or Toyota Yaris sedan. The base Versa also still offers three pedals.
Interior ComfortWhether you opt for a sedan or hatchback, the Sonic’s 5-passenger interior is somewhat roomy for its size and has at least an air of modernity with the standard 7-inch touch screen. Still, before buying we’d urge you to at least contrast the Sonic’s interior with what you could get in a Toyota Yaris, which looks downright luxurious compared to the Chevy. The Sonic’s rear seat is adequately roomy, but still trails the Honda Fit.
The versatile and recommendable hatchback models offer 47.7 cubic feet of cargo room with rear seats folded. That’s also less than a Honda Fit hatchback, but the Chevy has more space than the Honda with the rear seats up — 19 cubic feet vs. the Fit’s 16.6. We also like the handy dual-glove-box arrangement. Be aware that if you skimp and settle for a base 2020 Chevy Sonic sedan, you’ll feel like you’ve stepped back in time with old-fashioned crank windows.
Exterior StylingAll Chevy Sonic models have small footprints and tidy proportions, with the hatchback the smaller of the two. We favor the design of the 5-door hatchback, which reminds us of classy-yet-practical European models featuring hidden rear-door handles in the black areas of the C-pillars that make the Sonic hatchback appear more like a 2-door. At just under 160 inches in length, the Sonic hatch will also fit easily in small garages and parking spaces.
For traditionalists, the sedan offers a large trunk. Both body styles benefit from an attractive face that makes the Sonic appear wider and better integrates the headlight housings. The RS package, standard on hatchbacks and available on sedans, features a unique body kit and rocker moldings, rear spoiler, fog lights and other sporty bits.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
Even the least expensive 2020 Sonic comes with an impressive infotainment system that bundles a 7-inch touch screen and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration.
HATCHBACK STYLE
The Sonic hatchback looks better to our eyes, and pragmatically offers more versatility thanks to its rear hatch area. Another reason to opt for the 5-door Sonic is it comes with the RS Package that adds sportier aesthetics.
 
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Sonic sedan is available as LS, LT and Premier, while the pricier Sonic hatchback is offered in LT and Premier form. The lowest priced LS Sedan includes some nice features but lacks others. For example, it includes a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system with CarPlay and Android Auto, built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity and remote keyless entry, but lacks cruise control, power windows or power-adjustable mirrors. It rolls on basic 15-inch steel wheels. We recommend the hatchback or stepping up to the LT sedan, which offers better-quality cloth seating, 6-speaker audio and those features lacking in base models.
Factory OptionsTop-line Sonic Premier models have the most robust set of features, including faux-leather upholstery with heated and power-adjustable front seats, heated steering wheel, and 17-inch wheels. Premier hatch models add sport suspension, fog lights, and the RS package that bundles unique interior and exterior aesthetics.
Options include a lowering-suspension kit to improve handling on LT and Premier models. The option we most recommend — and a great value at $495 — is the Driver Confidence Package that includes forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning and rear-park assist. It is available on all but base LS sedans.
Note that more modern active safety features such as automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist that are easily available on rivals like the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa are not even optional on the aging Chevy Sonic.
Engine & TransmissionFor the 2020 model year, all Sonic models use a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, as the previous base 1.8-liter non-turbo was dropped last year. Also no longer available is the 6-speed manual transmission, meaning all Sonics now come with a 6-speed automatic. As with other rivals in this class, the Sonic is front-wheel drive. At up to 34 mpg, the Sonic is adequately efficient, but here again trails its fresher competitors. The Yaris, Fit and Versa, for example, earn up to 40 mpg, while the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio get 41 mpg.

Though reports abound that the Chevrolet Sonic’s days are numbered, it is hanging on for at least another year. The Sonic is Chevrolet’s subcompact sedan and hatchback, an economy car that competes with the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Nissan Versa and Kia Rio.
The Sonic comes with a peppy turbocharged engine and still looks fresh — especially in hatchback form — but it lags rivals in most other aspects. It doesn’t offer the kind of active safety features found on competitors, and it costs more than they do, too. Both of those are black marks against a car meant to attract younger buyers and those on a budget.
Moreover, base-model Sonics are still stuck in yesteryear, making you pay extra for the most basic of amenities: power windows. Meanwhile, one feature that some drivers might like — a manual transmission — is no longer available. Unless you are absolutely set on buying a made-in-America car from the bow-tie brand or are smitten by the Sonic’s looks, we think you can do better with one of its competitors.

 2020 Chevrolet Traverse PricingBecause the Traverse L exists, this big Chevy SUV’s base price is deceptively low at $30,995 including a destination charge of $1,195. At a minimum, you’ll want the Traverse LS ($34,095), but most likely you’ll upgrade to at least the LT Cloth ($36,595) so that you can spend even more money to get the optional safety-related technology for it.
Leather upholstery costs a minimum of $40,295 for the LT Leather trim, and the sporty RS trim ($44,795) commands an additional premium. The upscale Premier ($46,995) and High Country ($52,095) are, naturally, the most expensive versions. All-wheel drive is optional for all Traverses except the base L trim level, and it costs a minimum of $2,000 more.
Value isn’t particularly strong, in spite of the Traverse’s generous interior size and its Chevrolet Complete Care program that covers scheduled maintenance for the first year of ownership. We recommend the Traverse LT Leather with the Premium Package and 8-passenger seating. Priced at $45,390 before the commonly available rebates are applied, it delivers the best blend of equipment, value and capability.
How does the Traverse compare with other midsize, 3-row crossover SUVs? See below, and note that all prices are for 2-wheel-drive versions and include the destination charge.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet TraverseSince the Traverse’s last redesign for 2018, we’ve spent quality time in the High Country trim level with all-wheel drive. It’s the most expensive version of this Chevy, but also allowed us to sample every feature and function the SUV has to offer.
How fast is the Chevy Traverse?
Stab the accelerator pedal, and the Traverse’s 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 engine won’t shove you back into your seat. But this big SUV certainly is quick enough to get out of its own way. In our experience, the 9-speed automatic transmission operates smoothly most of the time, with occasional clunks and hiccups depending on the driving situation.
Does the Chevrolet Traverse get good gas mileage?
When equipped with all-wheel drive, the EPA says the Traverse should get 20 mpg in combined driving. With only the driver aboard, we averaged 19 mpg on a testing loop that included city, country, highway and mountain driving. Temperatures were hot, though, requiring continual use of the air-conditioning system, and the automatic engine stop/start system rarely engaged.

How does the Chevy Traverse handle?
Chevrolet’s latest vehicles excel in terms of dynamic tuning. From how the steering and brakes respond to input and feel when used, to how the suspension virtually eliminates wallow and provides remarkably athletic handling, the Chevy Traverse is good to drive. Better yet, in urban situations, this character makes it feel smaller and more maneuverable than you might guess.
However, the Traverse needs better brakes. On two different testing occasions, they demonstrated low fade resistance under extended, hard-use conditions in mountainous terrain. This finding doesn’t bode well for an SUV designed to carry up to eight people and tow as much as 5,000 pounds.

How does the Chevrolet Traverse ride on the highway?
On the open road, the Traverse’s expert suspension tuning provides a comfortable ride. You’ll feel the surface, but only in terms of baseline communication to let you know what’s happening where the rubber meets the road. And when you load the Traverse with people or cargo, both the drivetrain and suspension accommodate the extra weight with grace.
Perhaps due to its lofty perch atop the Traverse lineup, we felt the High Country trim allowed too much road and wind noise to enter the cabin. This might not be an issue in lower-trim levels, where such intrusion is to be expected.
How does the Chevy Traverse perform off-road?
Sitting on all-season tires, the Traverse is meant to battle snowstorms and to traverse well-trodden trails. While the SUV’s wheels are pushed out to the corners, helping to reduce approach and departure angles, the nose sits fairly low and has a plastic air dam that’s susceptible to damage. Plus, Chevy doesn’t publish a ground-clearance number, which means it probably isn’t worth bragging about.
With the High Country trim, Chevrolet offers a sophisticated dual-clutch all-wheel-drive system that can put up to 85 percent of engine power to a single rear wheel. Other Traverse models have a basic AWD system that can send power to the rear wheels when the front wheels slip.
Are the Chevrolet Traverse’s driving-assistance systems helpful?
As far as their effectiveness is concerned, the Traverse’s driving-assistance technologies are helpful. For 2020, they’re also more widely available, either as standard or optional equipment, than ever before. Still, if you want adaptive cruise control and an enhanced automatic emergency braking system that works at higher vehicle speeds, you need to spend over $50,000 for the High Country trim level.

Is the Chevy Traverse fun to drive?
Rather than characterize this SUV as “fun” to drive, it makes sense to call it “enjoyable” to drive. With a strong V6 engine, a mostly agreeable transmission, and athletic dynamic tuning, the Traverse is a good companion for daily driving. However, occasional transmission hiccups, brakes that can fade under duress, and a sometimes-aggravating automatic engine stop/start system might give some potential buyers pause.
Interior ComfortEach time we’ve driven the current version of the Traverse, it’s had High Country trim with Loft Brown leather. This, in our opinion, is the best combination. But it doesn’t come cheaply.
Does the Chevrolet Traverse have a nice interior?
Like most of its competitors, the Traverse’s interior is a mixture of inexpensive but durable plastic panels with nicer bits and pieces placed in strategic locations. In High Country trim, simulated-wood trim, piano-black accents, and metal-look detailing provide a properly upscale look — especially with the high-contrast Loft Brown leather.
What Chevy Traverse interior colors are available?
Every Traverse offers Jet Black as an interior color. If you’re seeking an alternative, most trims offer Dark Galvanized (dark gray) over Jet Black and Medium Ash Gray over Dark Atmosphere (brown). We think the best color combination is the Loft Brown over Jet Black leather interior, but to get it you need to buy the High Country trim.
Are the Chevrolet Traverse’s controls easy to use?
Chevrolet doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the Traverse’s controls, and that means you can easily find, identify and use the knobs, buttons and stalks. Everything in this SUV is intuitive, and that includes the new Chevrolet Infotainment 3 technology.
Is the Chevy Traverse’s infotainment system easy to use?
As was true with the MyLink infotainment system that came before it, Chevrolet Infotainment 3 is simple, easy and intuitive to use. New software and graphics improve the system for 2020, and each version includes Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Chevrolet Connected Access services through OnStar, including a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot. A reversing camera and Teen Driver safety technology are also standard.
Versions with an 8-inch rather than a 7-inch touch screen add a high-definition display and reversing camera, along with enhanced voice recognition and premium SiriusXM 360L satellite radio. Navigation, Bluetooth supporting two different devices, in-vehicle app support, and more are available depending on the trim level.
Is the Chevrolet Traverse comfortable?
While the Traverse is big inside, Chevrolet could make it more comfortable. For example, the driver’s seat could use improved thigh support through a separate power adjustment, and Chevrolet really should make the upper door-panel trim soft rather than hard.
The 2nd-row captain’s chairs are exceptionally comfortable, and they slide forward and back depending on seating and cargo requirements. Chevy’s Smart Slide right captain’s chair moves forward and tilts even when a child safety seat is installed in that location.
Can adults fit in the Chevy Traverse’s 3rd-row seat?
Adults can fit into this SUV’s 3rd-row seat, but given the Traverse’s impressive interior dimensions we expected better accommodations. Unless the people in the 2nd-row seat are willing to slide forward, the 3rd-row seat is best reserved for kids. Still, in spite of its lack of legroom, foot space and thigh support, it sure beats a Chevy Tahoe’s squished park bench of a third row.
Is the Chevrolet Traverse’s cargo area useful?
Measuring 23 cubic feet, the space behind the 3rd-row seat is more generous than in many of the Traverse’s competitors. We could load two full-size suitcases plus a compact folding stroller into the SUV’s trunk, and without using the handy under-floor storage compartment.
Most people will want to keep the 3rd-row seats folded down unless they’re necessary. Doing so creates a huge 57.8-cubic-foot cavern of a cargo hold. Maximum volume with the 2nd-row seats folded is equally impressive, at 98.2 cubic feet. The only way to beat these numbers is to get a Suburban or a minivan.
What else should I know about the Chevy Traverse?
Remote-engine starting is standard with any Traverse equipped with leather seats. To use it, you’ll need the OnStar Remote Access service plan, which costs $14.99 per month or $149.90 per year.
Exterior StylingChevy got the Traverse’s styling exactly right. Balanced forms, sculpted flanks, flared fenders, and tailored detailing give this crossover SUV an athletic and upscale appearance. It definitely looks best with 20-inch aluminum wheels, which are standard or optional for all trims except the base L version.
For a popular blacked-out look, options can transform any Traverse except for the L and High Country, adding the requisite black 20-inch wheels, black grille, black badges and other details. The Traverse RS comes this way right from the factory, and the Premier’s Redline Edition adds exclusive red-tinged highlights to the blacked-out trim for that version of the SUV.
What Chevy Traverse colors are available?
Buy the Traverse L, and you can pick between two paint colors: white or black. Upgrade to the LS trim, and four colors are available. The only versions of the SUV that come in all eight of the paint colors listed below are the LT Cloth, LT Leather and the Premier.
Mosaic Black Metallic

Summit White
Iridescent Pearl Tricoat ($995)

Favorite FeaturesHUGE INTERIOR
Believe it or not, the Traverse is larger inside than the more expensive and less efficient Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban. According to the EPA, the Traverse has 157.3 cubic feet of passenger volume while the Tahoe offers just 120.8 cubic feet and the Suburban musters no more than 122.4 cubic feet. The Traverse beats the Tahoe in every cargo-space measurement, too, but not the big ‘Burban, which is more accommodating in this regard.
SMART SLIDE 2ND-ROW SEAT
Midsize SUVs often have a child-safety seat installed in the second row, securely fastened to the LATCH anchors. This can make it hard to access or load passengers into the 3rd-row seat. In the Traverse, the standard Smart Slide function allows the right side of the 2nd-row bench seat or the right captain’s chair to slide and tilt forward to maximize 3rd-row access — even with an empty child-safety seat installed in that location.
TEEN DRIVER
Remember how you drove your parents’ car as a teenager? So do General Motors software engineers. Teen Driver is the result, a standard technology that allows Mom and Dad to set specific vehicle parameters, save them to a specific key fob, and then receive a driving report card after their offspring has taken the Traverse for a drive.
REAR-SEAT REMINDER
Every summer, news reports of children left in hot cars are all too common. General Motors developed its Rear Seat Reminder to combat situations in which parents might forget they have a child with them. If you open the Traverse’s rear door before driving the SUV, you’ll receive an audible and visual alert to check the back seat before leaving the vehicle.
REAR-CAMERA MIRROR
Load an SUV to the roof for an epic road trip, and the rearview mirror is rendered useless. That’s where the Traverse’s Rear Camera Mirror technology is useful. Flip the mirror to the camera view, and a live video feed provides an unobstructed, 180-degree view of what’s behind the Traverse.
HIDDEN STORAGE
In the Traverse, the infotainment screen powers up to reveal a hidden storage compartment. The screen continues working while in its raised position, and you can lock this compartment using a PIN code if you’d like. There is another hidden storage area in the trunk, under the floor. It’s perfect for hauling groceries in plastic sacks, or for stowing sports equipment.
CAPLESS FUEL FILL
Standard with every 2020 Traverse, capless fuel fill makes stopping for gas a quicker and more pleasant experience because there isn’t a gas cap to unscrew for fuel filling and then screw on after you’re finished.
Standard FeaturesWhen buying a new Chevrolet Traverse, you choose among L, LS, LT Cloth, LT Leather, RS, Premier and High Country trim levels. Below you’ll find the highlights for each.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse L?
Available only with front-wheel drive, the Chevy Traverse L comes with white or black paint and with black cloth seats. The only factory option is a front license-plate bracket, but you can upgrade the Traverse L with a variety of accessories.
Why does this version of the Traverse exist? One reason is so that Chevrolet can advertise a low starting price — even if that number is attached to an SUV that few dealerships stock and few people want to buy. Another reason is to provide a low-cost version of the SUV to government and business fleet buyers.
Highlights of the 8-passenger Traverse L include 18-inch aluminum wheels, automatic headlights, heated side mirrors, cruise control, and a triple-zone automatic climate-control system. The infotainment system includes plenty of features, such as a 7-inch touch-screen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and Chevrolet Connected Access services through OnStar.
Additional standard equipment includes a rear-seat-reminder system, which intends to prevent parents and pet owners from accidentally leaving someone important in the back seat. Teen Driver technology is also standard, giving parents of young drivers a report card detailing how the SUV was driven.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse LS?
The Traverse LS is just like the Traverse L, except that it costs several thousand dollars more and includes both dark tinted rear privacy glass and two additional paint colors. Basically, this is the Traverse that dealerships will stock as the lowest-priced model. Also, it’s worth noting that you must get the LS trim if you want to upgrade the Traverse with any options.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse LT Cloth?
Choose the Traverse LT Cloth, and this SUV automatically swaps out the useful 2nd-row bench seat for a couple of captain’s chairs. Don’t worry, though, because you can stick with a bench seat if you’d like.
This trim comes in a wider variety of exterior and interior colors, and includes fog lights, roof rails, and body-color side mirror caps. Inside, the driver enjoys an 8-way power-adjustable seat with lumbar support, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and express-up operation for the driver’s window. SiriusXM satellite radio is also standard with this trim.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse LT Leather?
Clearly, leather upholstery is an upgrade with this trim. It also gets heated front seats, a 6-way power-adjustable front-passenger’s seat with lumbar support, an upgraded driver-information display, and a universal programmable remote control.
Remote-engine starting is handy in both cold and hot climates, and this version of the Traverse includes a power rear liftgate, a blind-spot-monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, a lane-change alert system, and rear parking sensors. The infotainment system is upgraded, too, equipped with a high-definition 8-inch touch-screen display and premium SiriusXM 360L satellite radio.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse RS?
This year, Chevrolet drops the formerly standard turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine from the Traverse RS, replacing it with the same 3.6-liter V6 that comes in all other versions of the SUV.
Additionally, the Traverse RS features 20-inch aluminum wheels with a dark finish, automatic steering-wheel heating, a Bose premium sound system, and a slew of technology upgrades. They include a navigation system, a surround-view camera system, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keeping assist, and automatic high-beam headlight operation.
The Traverse RS also equips the SUV with a rear-camera mirror. Flip the rearview mirror from standard view to camera view, and you get a live feed of what’s going on behind the Traverse, complete with an unobstructed, 180-degree field of view.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse Premier?
If you’re not a fan of the Traverse RS’s dark-finish wheels and gray exterior trim, try the more upscale Premier. It comes with 20-inch machined-finish wheels, body-color exterior trim, and chrome door handles. A set of LED headlights illuminates the way forward, while auto-dimming side mirrors reduce glare after dark. A hands-free power rear liftgate helps to make loading easier when your arms are full.
Inside, the Premier features perforated leather, ventilated front seats and a power-adjustable steering wheel. Two different drivers can save their preferences using the memory-settings system, and the Premier includes a wireless smartphone charger.
What comes in the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse High Country?
This is the luxurious version of the Traverse, identifiable by its polished 20-inch wheels and dual-panel power sunroof. The Traverse High Country also offers an exclusive Loft Brown leather color in addition to Jet Black.
Additional upgrades with High Country trim include power-folding 3rd-row seats, adaptive cruise control, and an enhanced version of the automatic emergency-braking system that works at higher speeds. It also includes a Trailering Package with a hitch, heavy-duty engine cooling, and Chevy’s Hitch Guidance with Hitch View technology.
Factory OptionsAs we’ve established, the Traverse L is an optional-equipment desert, and the LS trim improves upon that only with items like 20-inch aluminum wheels ($1,995), a rear-seat infotainment system (from $1,750), and numerous exterior and interior upgrades mainly related to the SUV’s appearance and utility.
That makes your ticket to meaningfully useful options the LT Cloth trim level. With this version of the Traverse, the Convenience and Driver Confidence Package ($1,795) includes key infotainment and safety improvements, while the Driver Confidence Package II ($625) is a genuine bargain considering how it loads the Traverse up with nearly all of the important Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) technology. Trailering equipment ($650), 20-inch wheels, and rear-seat entertainment are also available for the LT Cloth, along with a 2nd-row bench seat (no cost) to swap in for the standard captain’s chairs.
When you upgrade to the Traverse LT Leather, an LT Premium Package ($3,095) installs navigation, a premium sound system, a surround-view camera system, a rear-camera mirror, a 120-volt power outlet, and a handsome set of 20-inch aluminum wheels. The Driver Confidence Package II is the other main option package for this trim, along with trailering equipment, a dual-panel sunroof ($1,400), rear-seat entertainment, and a 2nd-row bench seat.
The Traverse RS trim includes most of the LT Leather’s optional equipment, leaving the trailering equipment and rear-seat entertainment system as the major upgrades.
If you’re trying to figure out which version of the Traverse offers the Redline Edition Package ($2,495), it’s the Premier. This upgrade equips the SUV with a blacked-out exterior appearance and 20-inch black wheels with red stripes — hence, the Redline Edition. Trailering equipment and the dual-panel sunroof are included with the Redline Edition Package. Separately, both trailering equipment and the dual-panel sunroof are available with the standard Premier, along with a rear-seat entertainment system.
The High Country trim is fully equipped, except for an optional rear-seat entertainment system and all-wheel drive. Optional for every version of the Traverse except for the base L trim level, AWD costs a minimum of $2,000 depending on the trim level.
As is always true, prices may have changed since this review was published. Be sure to research current Chevrolet Traverse prices on KBB.
Engine & TransmissionWith the departure of the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, which was standard and exclusively available with RS trim, all Traverses have a 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 engine. A 9-speed automatic transmission powers the front wheels (FWD), and all versions of the SUV except for the L trim level are available with all-wheel drive (AWD).

#9 in Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
Chevrolet’s Traverse is an attractive, comfortable and capable family-sized crossover SUV with three rows of seating, up to 8-passenger capacity, and more overall interior room than the significantly more expensive Chevy Tahoe. It competes against a long list of similar vehicles, including the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Subaru Ascent, Toyota Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas, among others. Your selection in this segment has never been better, and the Traverse is worthy of consideration.
Don’t be fooled by the low starting price, though. Most Traverse buyers will want to upgrade to the LS trim at a minimum, which costs thousands of dollars more and for no other reason than to obtain dark-tinted privacy glass and access to some options. And to get driving-assistance and collision-avoidance features that are increasingly standard in competitors, you’ll pay closer to"

Well-rounded for a subcompact hatchback
Excellent fuel efficiency
Plenty of technology on offer
Reasonably priced","Cons
One of the smallest cars
And one of the slowest",15000,"The good news is that while this is a modest amount of money in the world of car buying, the Spark is not as bargain-basement in its offerings as some of its subcompact rivals. It prioritizes connectivity over convenience by installing smartphone integration and Wi-Fi in the base model, but going with manually operated windows. For a young driver-around-town, this makes more sense, especially when the window is only opened for odd occasions like grabbing parking lot tickets.
Fuel economy is another advantage, making the Chevy Spark a logical choice for commuting.
Apologies for the obvious “you get what you pay for” saying, but it applies here. If someone spends a lot of their time driving, it makes sense to buy the highest quality possible, which will also have a bearing on resale values. Choose the Spark if it sparks joy, but do some research into the competition before making a final decision.
 2020 Chevrolet Spark PricingThe 2020 Chevrolet Spark LS with the manual transmission has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $13,220. Add the destination charge of $875 and the total is $14,095. The 1LT starts at $15,195, the Activ at $17,095, and the 2LT from $17,495. The CVT costs an extra $1,100.
Even taking a 2LT and adding the automatic transmission, Driver Confidence package (see the Safety section) and several other options, it would still only be around the $20,000 mark. And Chevy’s retail site is already offering a $750 discount. Haggle with a human and that could come down even more.
The Mitsubishi Mirage is cheaper but has even less power. The Nissan Versa sedan is another cut-price alternative. The Kia Rio, Toyota Yaris and Honda Fit are all more expensive, but they could be easier to live with and sell on a few years down the line.
Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area are paying for their new Spark. Resales values are not expected to be as robust as the (albeit larger and pricier) Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet SparkThe combination of small car, 98-horsepower engine and a manual transmission does allow the Spark to move off from a standstill with some liveliness. It’s at higher speeds and/or uphill stretches where this 4-cylinder in the Chevy Spark begins to feel like the little engine that can’t. It’s also on freeways where the Spark’s high sides are affected by the aerodynamic wake of 18-wheelers and strong cross winds.
The optional continuously variable transmission (CVT), for those who can’t or won’t use a stick shift, puts a damper even on this small amount of pep by not being particularly responsive. It doesn’t even improve fuel consumption to any appreciable degree.
The Spark really ignites in town, however. Its small footprint and tight turning circle make it wonderfully maneuverable and easy to park.
Interior ComfortThe 4-seater 2020 Chevy Spark does well for headroom, but legroom for rear passengers is always going to be tight in a subcompact hatchback.
 However, those rear seats split and fold in the usual 60/40 manner, so there’s some versatility for people and/or cargo. Speaking of cargo space, with both rear seats up, there’s 11.1 cubic feet — enough for a couple of suitcases. Fold both of them down and the Spark offers 27.2 cubic feet.
 There are some cheap plastics, sure, and more sound insulation would have been nice, but this is one of the least expensive new cars available. All Sparks have a full-color 7-inch touch screen in the center stack, and the dashboard’s design is arguably attractive.
Exterior StylingApart from a few daring color choices like Red Hot, Orange Burst and Raspberry, the 2020 Spark might easily be one of those cars that no one ever really notices. Which might be a good thing. The shape is practical though, and the high roof is useful for passengers and cargo alike. It’s a 4-door car, but the handles for the rear side doors are disguised in an effort to appear more like a coupe.
 The Chevy Spark Activ deviates from the usual script with a raised suspension, roof rails and a few cosmetic changes that provide something of a crossover-SUV look. The range-topping 2LT reverts to regular car styling, but adds some more chrome accents.
Favorite FeaturesTECH-RICHAlthough the base Spark has poverty-spec manually operated windows, it still comes with sweet tech like smartphone integration, a 7-inch touch screen to control a modern infotainment system, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth for two devices, and a pair of USB ports.
FRUGAL PERFORMANCEPart of the attraction of high-economy cars is low-fuel consumption. The Chevy Spark delivers these goods by achieving up to 38 mpg on the highway, regardless of transmission.
Standard FeaturesIt’s an odd mix of basic features alongside modern technology in the entry-level 2020 Spark LS. The steering wheel adjusts for height only, not reach; the driver’s seat is only manually adjustable in two directions, and the audio system comes with just four speakers.
 But then there’s Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, plus a 7-inch touch screen, and a 3-month trial subscription to OnStar with 4G LTE connectively and Wi-Fi. Safety features include 10 airbags, rearview camera and a 6-month trial of OnStar Guidance with automatic crash response and roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsObtaining more equipment for a new Chevy Spark is accomplished by buying a higher trim level, although there’s the choice of staying with the manual transmission or opting for the CVT. If possible, at least try to stretch to the 1LT for the power windows and better audio system.
 The Activ model has what it calls a “Touring” suspension, which raises the ride height to make the Spark more crossover-SUV-like, while the extra suspension travel should enhance comfort somewhat.
 Top-line 2LT models have a leather-wrapped steering wheel, chrome exterior trim and rear parking sensors. It’s also eligible for a power sunroof and the Driver Confidence package.
Engine & TransmissionNo turbochargers. The 2020 Spark has a 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine making 98 horsepower. Which isn’t a whole lot. Then again, the Spark is such a small car that it doesn’t need much thrust to get moving.
 Drive goes to the front wheels through either a standard-issue 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) as the automatic option. There’s some variation on fuel consumption, but every Spark is estimated to average 33 mpg.
 1.4-liter inline-4 98 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm 94 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/38 mpg (automatic), 29/38 mpg (manual), 30/37 mpg (automatic, Spark Activ), 29/37 mpg (manual, Spark Activ)

Driving the  2020 BMW 5 SeriesAfter years of 5 Series cars appealing to enthusiasts, the previous generation received some criticism for being too luxurious. The 2020 BMW 5 Series sedan moves the meter a little back toward the athletic, but without sacrificing smoothness. A driver could spend a leisurely day in comfort and serenity. Push it harder, though, and a deep well of ability gradually reveals itself. Selectable driving modes help in this regard; Sport is a good starting point. The 530i’s turbocharged 4-cylinder does a respectable job at the entry level, the plug-in hybrid version has its own virtues, the 540i is muscular, and the M550i xDrive is phenomenally quick.
Interior ComfortBMW has sometimes been accused of having rather hard interiors. But the 2020 5 Series cabin is simply gorgeous. The elegant dash design can be covered in synthetic or real leather, offering a number of 2-tone colors including Cognac and Night Blue with contrasting stitching.
Controls are, for the most part, logically arranged and easy to operate, although the rotary and touch-based controls for the 10.25-inch infotainment system take some getting used to (you can also opt for a system that uses gesture control). Rear-seat space is fine for 6-foot adults and the 5 Series’ 18.7-cubic-foot trunk can easily swallow a weekend’s worth of luggage or a couple of golf bags.
Exterior StylingAll the usual BMW design cues are here, like the double-kidney grille and the Hofmeister kink in the rear-side windows. In common with the larger 7 Series, the new 5 Series has a “hockey-stick” feature along the lower flanks. As a whole, the various shapes and lines work to emphasize the car’s width and length rather than its height. The BMW faithful will be happy, but the styling may not attract any new converts.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT ALL-WHEEL DRIVE
Be it the entry-level 530i, mid-grade 540i or plug-in hybrid 530e, the 2020 BMW 5 Series sedans can all be equipped with traction-enhancing xDrive all-wheel drive. The xDrive system routes power in a 60/40 split with the majority going to the rear wheels. However, 100 percent of the power can travel to either axle if the complex electronic wheel monitors so desire.
REMOTE CONTROL PARKING
Found a parking spot but it’s just too snug to fully open the doors? No problem. The 2020 BMW 5 Series offers a remote parking system that allows the driver to park or pull the car out of a narrow spot all via buttons on the remote key fob.
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 BMW 5 Series range starts off with the 530i. It has the lowest power output, but everything else is suitably lush for a car costing in excess of $50,000. As well as 18-inch alloy wheels and a moonroof, there are navigation with real-time traffic updates, 16-way power-adjustable front seats (with memory settings on the driver’s side), Comfort Access remote locking and start, power-adjustable steering column, drive-mode selection, LED headlights, rearview camera, parking sensors, Apple CarPlay, and advanced driver aids (blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, and lane-keeping alerts).
Factory OptionsExtras run the gamut from sensible to indulgent; all are tempting. A buyer may choose 20-way-adjustable front seats with heating/cooling/massaging functions, all-wheel drive, and a Bowers & Wilkins 1,400-watt/16-speaker setup, which is one of the absolute best automotive audio systems. An Executive package includes soft-closing doors and a power rear sunshade; adaptive cruise control, side-collision avoidance and Traffic Jam Assist (partial self-driving) are in the Driver Assistance Plus bundle; a Dynamic Handling package brings an adaptive suspension, bigger brakes and rear-wheel steering.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2020 5 Series comes in rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) and offers a variety of propulsion setups. The 530i has a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine making 248 horsepower.
The 530e is a plug-in hybrid whose turbo-4 is augmented by an electric motor, for the same horsepower as the 530i, but slightly more torque. The 530e’s battery can be replenished in less than three hours using a 240-volt charger and has an electric-only range of 16 miles.
The 540i is typical BMW territory — an inline-6 developing 335 horsepower. If the super-heated M5 is too much, there’s the 523-horsepower M550i that comes with all-wheel drive as standard.
Each engine has an auto stop/start, but this function can be disabled. Every version employs an 8-speed automatic transmission.

While some companies are fine building premium-midsize-luxury sedans, the 2020 BMW 5 Series takes pride in being more than the sum of its parts. The roomy cabin can easily accommodate four adults, and there’s enough high-tech and luxury to satisfy even the most jaded critic.
But it’s the 5 Series’ performance that leaves all rivals wanting. The 5 Series enjoys that perfect balance between ride comfort and handling prowess that gives it an edge over newer designs like the Audi A6 and Lexus GS, although the Mercedes-Benz E-Class can still give the BMW a run for its money. Of course, the ultimate 5 Series is the monster BMW M5, but that’s so good it gets it own review.

Driving the  2020 Cadillac EscaladeCadillac’s full-size SUV looks imposing but from behind the wheel it’s a comfortable and surefooted pussycat with the power and grace of a Bengal tiger. Yes, the Escalade is big, which can make tight parking garages a challenge, but it feels like a high-riding luxury sedan on the road, where it boasts refined manners and a plush ride.
Moreover, Cadillac’s 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 is a brute. Power for passing and merging is in abundant supply, and the 10-speed automatic transmission delivers smooth shifts. The power-steering assist feels about right, and GM’s Magnetic Ride Control suspension does a fine job of managing the Escalade’s bulk, which can top 6,000 pounds if you order a 4-wheel-drive (4WD) Escalade ESV. With 4WD, the 2020 Escalade is much more capable in wintry road conditions.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 Cadillac Escalade, especially the ESV, has an abundance of interior room in all three rows. Supple leather is used for the seats, while beautifully finished wood inlays grace the dash, door panels and wide center console. When equipped with the 2nd-row bench option the Escalade can seat eight, but we like how the 7-seat Escalade’s center buckets ease access to the third row. That third row, incidentally, can fold flat into the floor, but it creates a slight rise at the rear liftgate opening that means items must be lifted a few additional inches before being slid in. When the second and third rows are folded, the standard Escalade has 94.2 cubic feet of space while the ESV has 120.
Exterior StylingThe 2020 Cadillac Escalade has a refined appearance highlighted by a massive grille with active aerodynamic shutters that close at highway speeds to improve aerodynamics and increase fuel economy. The Escalade also benefits from LED headlights and taillights, plus a rear spoiler that also serves to hide the rear windshield wiper.
For a sportier and more aggressive-looking Escalade, consider ordering the $2,700 Sport Edition Package. It includes black trim on the grille, grille header, the lower grille surround and the body-side molding, plus 12-spoke 22-inch alloy wheels in a Midnight Silver finish. The Sport Edition Package is available only in these three colors: Red Passion Tintcoat, Satin Steel Metallic and Black Raven.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER AWARENESS PACKAGE
This comprehensive safety suite, standard on all 2020 Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum Escalades, includes Safety Seat Alert, Forward Collision Alert, Lane Keep Assist (with Lane-Departure Warning), Lane-Change Alert (with Blind-Zone Alert), Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking and automatic high-beam headlights.
MAGNETIC RIDE CONTROL
This standard suspension works like magic on the Escalade, greatly improving its ride and handling on a variety of road surfaces. By using a magnetic field to continuously adjust the viscosity of the shock fluid at each wheel, Magnetic Ride Control creates an Escalade that’s comfortable yet far more agile than a vehicle weighing nearly three tons has a right to be.
Standard FeaturesStandard features abound in the 2020 Cadillac Escalade. They include Magnetic Ride Control suspension, 20-inch chrome wheels, a 16-speaker Bose audio system, a hands-free liftgate, heated and cooled 12-way power-adjustable front seats, deep-tinted glass, front and rear Park Assist and center-row bucket seats (a center bench is an option).
All Escalades also have a single-slot CD player, Surround Vision, wireless smartphone charging, rain-sensing wipers and a surround-vision camera. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, along with a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, are also standard.
Factory OptionsAutomatic Emergency Braking and Lane Departure Warning, along with Lane Keep Assist and Side Blind-Zone Alert, are part of the Driver Awareness Package. Also available: a Rear Camera Mirror (that provides a superb view of what’s behind the Escalade), plus an upgraded braking system and 22-inch machine-finished wheels. A head-up display also is available, as are a sunroof and a rear-entertainment system with wireless headphones. If you want an Escalade with Adaptive Cruise Control, it’s part of the Driver Assist Package that’s standard on the Premium Luxury and Platinum Escalades.
Engine & TransmissionOne engine powers the 2020 Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV: a direct-injected 6.2-liter V8 that smoothly pumps out 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Standard Escalades are 2-(rear)-wheel drive (2WD); ordering one with 4-wheel drive (4WD) adds $3,000 to the price.
GM’s 10-speed automatic transmission shifts in a smooth fashion, while Active Fuel Management (Cadillac’s name for cylinder deactivation) improves fuel economy on the highway. Note: Premium fuel is not required, but Cadillac recommends it to exploit the full might of the Escalade’s big pushrod V8.

The 2020 Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV with three rows of seating that can accommodate up to eight occupants. Its body-on-frame construction is old-school but effective, contributing to a skill set that includes some real off-road talent in all-wheel-drive form and the capacity to tow a substantial 8,500 pounds.
Rivals like the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia have the same kind of construction and offer similar abilities, but the Armada has the most powerful engine of the bunch. It also reaches Infiniti (Nissan’s luxury division) heights of luxuriousness in its plushest model (Platinum Reserve), while even the entry-level (SV) still comes well equipped.
Be aware that fuel economy is not a strong point, nor is the Armada a resale-values champ.
 2020 Nissan Armada PricingA rear-drive 2020 Armada SV starts out with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $47,100. Add a destination charge of $1,395 and the total is $48,495. The SL starts at $53,295, the Platinum is priced from $61,925 and Platinum Reserve comes in at $66,425. All-wheel drive is an extra $3,000 in every variant. Putting these figures into context, they’re either slightly or appreciably lower than the competition.
Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Armada. Historically, the Armada has a tough time competing in the resale-value market against such stalwarts as the Chevrolet Tahoe and the Ford Expedition. But Nissan is often an average performer in this respect. Our findings have shown that an all-wheel-drive SL does better than other Armada trim levels, so we’re more inclined to make this our recommendation.

Driving the  2020 Nissan ArmadaOn the plus side, the 2020 Armada is roomy and quiet, at least in the first two seating rows. The subdued-yet-thrilling rumble of the muscular V8 adds to the eager anticipation of road trips, as long as the distances between gas stations are not too great.
The front seats are well cushioned and pleasantly supportive, making long stints behind the wheel bearable. And overall comfort is improved by the availability of a heated steering wheel and cooled front seats.
The automatic transmission does its job efficiently and all-wheel-drive versions have a low gearing range for optimum off-road ability, which is enhanced by a useful ground clearance of 9.1 inches.
On the minus side, the Armada’s considerable size can be a liability around town. City streets are often rougher, exposing limitations in the Armada’s suspension setup. This is also when the steering might feel heavy to some.
Interior ComfortAfter climbing into the raised driving position, then adjusting the seat and steering column (there’s a wide range of movement, so most people should find their ideal setup with ease), it quickly becomes apparent that the large glass areas give the Nissan Armada superb outward vision.
Changing the focus to inside the cabin, the quality of materials, wood trim, substantial-feeling switchgear, and excellent general fit and finish put the Armada almost in the same league as its luxury Infiniti counterpart.
Behind the third row is 16.5 cubic feet of cargo area. This expands first to 49.9 and then a maximum of 95.4 cubic feet when both the second and third rows are folded.
Exterior StylingThis is Nissan’s largest SUV, and it’s pretty chunky, upright and tall. That’s part of its charm.
The entry-level Armada rides on 18-inch alloy wheels, which is fine, but the 20-inch versions in the higher trims look more appropriate (even if they do have a slightly adverse effect on ride quality).
This model year now brings the option of 22-inch wheels. Think long and hard about how much ride comfort can be sacrificed in the quest to look cool.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT AROUND-VIEW MONITOR
This kind of feature is often found in luxury vehicles. It’s a) really helpful and b) kind of cool to have a camera system that does so much more than provide a rearward-looking aspect. Drivers get a full 360-degree picture plus a bird’s-eye view. Standard in the SL and above.
SECOND-ROW CAPTAIN’S CHAIRS
For those families and/or businesses that can sacrifice one seating space, selecting the optional pair of captain’s chairs brings far more comfort to the second row while improving access to the third row. At $450, it’s a reasonably priced extra, but only available in the SL/Platinum (standard in the Platinum Reserve version).
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Nissan Armada full-size SUV comes in SV, SL, Platinum and Platinum Reserve trim levels. The SV comes with a 14-speaker Bose audio system, navigation, 8-inch infotainment touch screen, hands-free text-messaging assistance, keyless entry/ignition, front/rear parking sensors, heated side mirrors, forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and Rear Door Alert (see the Safety section below).
The SL trim kicks off with 20-inch alloy wheels, adds a power tailgate, fog lights, puddle lights, self-dimming mirrors and rain-sensing wipers. The Platinum has a heated steering wheel, rear-seat entertainment system, 360-degree camera system, and an intelligent rearview mirror displaying the feed from the rear-facing camera.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is available in every version of the 2020 Armada.
SV models are eligible for fog lights, self-dimming rearview mirror with universal garage-door opener, power tailgate, power-folding 60/40-split/fold 3rd-row seats, and a trailer package.
The SL may be optioned with blind-spot monitoring, power moonroof, Intelligent Distance Control/Back-up Intervention, and 2nd-row captain’s chairs.
Platinum has virtually everything as standard, including leather upholstery, while Platinum Reserve has the captain’s chairs and some bespoke cosmetic touches.
Buyers may now choose 22-inch alloy wheels.
Engine & TransmissionCompared with main rivals like the Chevy Tahoe, Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia, the 2020 Armada has the most power, with 390 horsepower from a 5.6-liter V8. A 7-speed automatic transmission directs energy to the rear axle in standard rear-wheel-drive (RWD) form or to both axles with the optional all-wheel-drive (AWD) system.
It’s a strong and dependable drivetrain, but hardly thrifty with fuel, averaging around 15 mpg (AWD).
Maximum towing capacity of 8,500 pounds sounds impressive, but most rivals have the same kind of ability.

Leisurely acceleration from 1.8-liter base engine",20680,"Looking at the upper end of the range, the Civic EX nets you the more-powerful engine for $24,630, while the Corolla XLE at $25,045 still uses the base engine. The top-spec Corolla XSE gets the better engine for $26,545, and squares off against the Civic EX-L at $25,830. The Civic range tops out with the Touring for $28,530, which is about $2K more than you can spend on a Corolla.
2020 Toyota Corolla vs. Hyundai Elantra
The Hyundai Elantra has been revised for 2020, adding more standard safety equipment to bring it up to par with the Corolla and the Honda Civic. Forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and lane-keep assist are now standard on all models including the base version. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are included on all but the base model. (Adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beams, and safe-exit assist are optional on the Limited only.)
The Elantra’s standard engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, figures that just beat the output of the Corolla’s standard 1.8-liter. Both cars use a CVT as their standard transmission. The Elantra’s more-powerful engine option is a 1.6-liter turbo in the Sport trim level. It makes 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, surpassing the 169 horses and 151 lb-ft put out by the Corolla sport model’s 2.0-liter.
The Elantra Sport’s 1.6 turbo is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Elantra also has a third engine offering, a smaller 1.4-liter turbo again paired with the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic in the Elantra Eco. Unlike the Corolla, the Elantra sedan has dropped the manual transmission. The Elantra, like the Corolla, also offers a hatchback body style, which is where enthusiast buyers can find a stick shift as well as other sporty equipment.
The Elantra does not offer a hybrid model. Instead, its most economical variant is the Eco, with a 1.4-liter that gets an estimated 33/41-mpg city/highway, beating the non-hybrid Corolla’s EPA numbers but still far off the Corolla Hybrid’s 53/52 mpg. The 2.0-liter engine that powers most Elantras is rated at 30/40-mpg city/highway (the base SE trim adds one mpg to both estimates), which is better than the Corolla’s base 1.8-liter and similar to the Toyota’s optional 2.0-liter with its CVT. The Elantra Sport returns 26-mpg city and 33-mpg highway, which is below any of the Corolla’s figures, but the Elantra Sport’s 1.6-liter turbo also is more powerful.
The Hyundai Elantra rides on the same 106.3-inch wheelbase as the Corolla, and its overall length is within a half-inch of the Toyota’s. Within that same-size envelope, the Elantra squeezes out a bit more interior space, as most of its interior dimensions are fractionally larger. At 14.4 cubic feet, the Elantra’s trunk is also slightly larger.
Pricing for the Hyundai Elantra starts at $19,880, which undercuts the least expensive Corolla by around $700. The next-step-up Elantra SEL, at $20,630, maintains a roughly similar advantage over the Corolla LE. The Elantra Value Edition adds heated seats, a sunroof and passive keyless entry for $21,530. Next up is the Elantra Eco at $22,180, which is nearly $2K less than the Corolla Hybrid, although the Eco’s fuel economy is substantially lower than the Hybrid’s.
The two models at the top of the Elantra lineup are the $23,730 Limited, which is about $1,300 less than the Corolla XLE, and the $24,730 Elantra Sport, which is about $1,800 less than the Corolla XSE — although the Toyotas come with more standard equipment.
2020 Toyota Corolla vs. Kia Forte
Another small sedan whose 106.3-inch wheelbase matches that of the Corolla is the Kia Forte, and its overall length is also within a half-inch of the Toyota’s. The Forte’s interior dimensions are close to or slightly exceed those of the Corolla. At 15.3 cubic feet, the Kia Forte’s trunk is more than two cubic feet larger than the Corolla’s.
Standard safety features on the Forte include forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are included on the GT-Line and above (they’re optional on the GT CVT). Adaptive cruise control is available only on the GT automatic. Even the base Forte comes with an 8-inch touch screen, and Android Auto is included as well as Apple CarPlay.
The Kia Forte has two available engines: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and a more powerful 1.6-liter turbo-4. The 2.0-liter is good for 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, figures that just exceed those of the Corolla’s standard 1.8-liter. A CVT is standard on all but the base Forte FE, which still comes with a 6-speed manual (the CVT is optional on the FE).
A more powerful 1.6-liter turbo is exclusive to the new-for-2020 Forte GT. This engine (which also powers the Hyundai Elantra Sport) is paired with either a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic or a 6-speed manual. The GT’s 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque out-muscle the max horsepower and torque of the Corolla’s top engine offering, a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter.
With its base engine and the CVT, the Forte’s fuel economy ranges from 29 to 31 mpg in the city, and from 40 to 41 mpg on the highway. (The base engine with the 6-speed stick fares less well, at 27/37-mpg city/highway.) Those city estimates are similar to the base Corolla engine’s, while the highway numbers are slightly better. The Corolla only reaches 40-mpg highway with its optional engine. The Forte GT’s 1.6-liter turbo gets 27/35-mpg city/highway with its CVT and 25/32 mpg with its 6-speed stick, which is not quite as good as the sport-themed Corollas with their less-powerful 2.0-liter.
The Kia Forte starts at $18,715 for the base FE with a 6-speed manual. Add an automatic, and the FE is $19,615, still about $800 less than the base Corolla L. The Forte’s two intermediate trim levels bracket the Corolla LE in price. The Forte LXS is $20,115, while the GT-Line is $21,315. (Note that the GT-Line does not have the upgraded powertrain and other mechanical features of the GT; it’s denoted mostly by sporty trim.)
The most expensive of the standard-engine Forte models is the EX for $22,915, which is roughly $2K less than the Corolla XLE. The Forte’s GT models are the most expensive variants at $23,215 with the CVT and $23,815 with the 6-speed manual. Both are less than the Corolla’s top-spec sporty offering, the $26,545 XSE.
2020 Toyota Corolla vs. Mazda3
The Mazda3 was redesigned for the 2019 model year, and like the Corolla is offered in sedan and hatchback body styles. Mazda has taken the 3 upmarket in features and finish, to an even greater degree than Toyota has done with the Corolla. Standard on all models is forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control. The Mazda’s central infotainment display screen is larger than the Toyota’s at 8.8 inches, and it’s controlled via a rotary knob. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all but the base trim level.
The Mazda3 sits astride a 107.3-inch wheelbase, which is one inch longer than the Corolla’s, and the Mazda is roughly an inch longer overall. The Mazda3 offers similar headroom and front legroom, fractionally more rear-seat legroom, and a bit more shoulder room front and rear. Trunk space is effectively equal between the two.
The Mazda3 has a single engine offering, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that’s larger and more powerful than either of the Corolla engines, with 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission is available only on the hatchback; the sedan comes with a 6-speed automatic. Unusual among compact sedans, the Mazda3 also can be had with all-wheel drive.
Given that its engine is larger and more powerful than the Corolla’s, it’s not too surprising that the Mazda3’s fuel economy is not as good. The front-wheel-drive Mazda3 sedan’s EPA estimates are 26-mpg city and 35-mpg highway; the top-spec Premium version does one mpg better in both the city and highway, at 27/36 mpg. The all-wheel-drive Mazda3 is rated at 25/32-mpg city/highway.
Mazda3 pricing starts at $22,420, considerably more expensive than the base Corolla L or the Corolla LE. The Mazda3 Select is $23,620, roughly equal to the Corolla SE. Next up is the Mazda3 Preferred at $25,120, putting it within $100 of the Corolla XLE. At the top of the range sits the Mazda3 Premium for $27,420, with is about $900 more than the most expensive Corolla. All-wheel drive can be had on the Mazda3 Select, Preferred and Premium trims, and adds $1,400.
 2020 Toyota Corolla PricingThe 2020 Toyota Corolla has a base Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $20,430 for the L model (including a $930 destination charge). Comparably equipped, price increases on the new Corolla range from $815 to $1,300. The LE is priced from $20,880, only $450 higher, making it an obvious choice over the base car.
The top model with the base 1.8 engine, the XLE, starts at $24,880, a significant $4,000 jump over the LE. Sport models equipped with the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder start at $22,880 for the SE CVT, which represents a $2K premium over the equivalent 1.8-liter Corolla LE. The 6-speed-manual SE is $23,580 and the additional $700 also includes a few extras such as passive keyless entry and a power sunroof. The XSE is $26,380 and features content similar to the XLE.
The Corolla Hybrid is sold in a single trim level, LE, and is priced in the middle of the range with a sticker starting at $23,880. That represents a $3,000 premium over the roughly comparable non-hybrid LE.
Be sure to check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area are paying for the new Corolla, and rest assured that when the time comes to sell your used Corolla, it will command a high resale value.

Driving the  2020 Toyota CorollaThe competence of the new platform shines in the 2020 Toyota Corolla driving experience. The car is solid, quiet and offers a comfortable ride without backing down when pushed. The steering is crisp, yet tends a touch toward the light side, which makes it easy to wheel about. Toyota has refined its continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), giving it a fixed-ratio first gear to take some of the elasticity out of its response when pulling away from a stop. Most drivers won’t be aware of its presence, and those who do notice probably would be better suited to the manual version to more effectively exploit the Corolla’s independent suspension.
The Corolla Hybrid does feel down on power compared to its conventional counterparts, but the instantaneous torque from the electric motor gives it acceptable off-the-line acceleration around town. Its handling is closer to the standard L and LE models than the slightly sportier SE and XSE, and its fuel economy is outstanding.
The 2.0-liter engine in the SE and XSE is preferable to the tepid 1.8-liter in the other models, as it offers both better fuel economy and more power — although even with the larger engine, the Corolla is far from heart-poundingly quick. Nor do the Corolla’s sporty trims rise to the level of the lively handling of the Honda Civic. Instead, the 2020 Toyota Corolla delivers what we would characterize as a mainstream small-car driving experience, but does so with greater polish and refinement than before.
RELATED: Best Small Cars of 2020
Interior ComfortToyota describes the Corolla’s interior design philosophy as “sensuous minimalism.” The layout is clean and horizontal with few lines, and the dash is dominated by an infotainment touch screen (7-inch diagonal on the base Corolla L, eight inches on all other models). Apple CarPlay is supported as is Amazon Alexa, but Android Auto is not. The system is easy to use and, helpfully, is flanked by conventional buttons. There are also volume and tuner knobs, and the climate-control system resides below. The instrument cluster houses a digital display.
The standard version is 4.2 inches, while a 7-inch configurable screen comes on upper-trim levels. Soft-touch materials can be found on all the upper surfaces, and on the SE and XSE, the front bucket seats are more contoured to provide additional support. Cloth upholstery is standard on the L and LE. The XLE uses SofTex Leatherette, while the SE and XSE combine SofTex with striped Sport fabric inserts.
A leather-wrapped steering wheel is included on SE, XSE and XLE trims. The cabin has a light, airy feel to it, although rear-seat accommodations are not as generous as before and trail most rivals. The new Corolla’s materials and level of fit and finish have improved to the point where they’re now akin to what you’d expect in a more premium vehicle.
Exterior StylingLike the cabin, the 2020 Toyota Corolla has a contemporary look with a front end dominated by a large trapezoidal mesh grille. The headlight units feature LED daytime running lights with two or three elements per side depending on trim level. The Corolla’s profile is clean, with a soft character line rising from the front wheel arch through the rear deck. From the back, the taillights are connected by a single strip running across the decklid.
While the front end shares a family resemblance to the latest Camry and Avalon, the overall shape and look of the Corolla are more on the understated 4-door side of the ledger than a flashy, Euro-inspired sports sedan. The sporty-themed SE and XSE feature larger, 18-inch wheels with gray accents, their own specific grille texture in gray metallic rather than black, a rear spoiler and restyled rocker-panel trim (the latter two items are color-matched in the SE and gray in the XSE). A special Nightshade Edition is based on the SE trim level and includes black wheels and additional black exterior elements.
Favorite FeaturesSPORT TRIM
No one will confuse a Corolla for a Subaru WRX; however, if you like to shift for yourself and experience the nimbleness of the independent rear suspension, the SE trim level with the 6-speed manual transplants the fun factor from the Corolla Hatchback into the sedan. The fancier XSE comes only with the CVT but retains the more-powerful engine and retuned chassis.
HYBRID POWERTRAIN
Smooth, quiet and comfortable, the Corolla Hybrid is a great choice for those who want near-Prius-level fuel economy (53-mpg city, 52-mpg highway) in an affordable, conventional-looking sedan body. The operation of the hybrid powertrain is seamless, including the stop/start function. The Hybrid’s pricing starts in the middle of the Corolla range.
REV MATCHING
The 6-speed manual transmission, which is exclusive to the Corolla SE, includes a nifty bit of tech more commonly found in sports cars: rev matching. When downshifting, the system automatically blips the throttle, raising engine revs to smooth the transition to the newly selected lower gear. The feature can make even neophyte stick-shift drivers look like accomplished pros.
Standard FeaturesAll Toyota Corolla models come with the Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 suite of driver assists. This includes forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, lane-departure alert and lane-keep assist, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control (with a stop-and-go feature on CVT models), road-sign assist and lane-tracing assist that helps to keep the vehicle centered in its lane.
XLE and XSE models also come with blind-spot monitoring. Sport models (SE and XSE) feature larger 18-inch wheels, contoured sport seats and a rear decklid spoiler. All trim levels come with power windows and door locks, standard 6-speaker audio with Apple CarPlay compatibility, and one or two USB ports. Automatic climate control is included on all models except the base Corolla L trim.
Factory OptionsAmong the upgrades available on the new Corolla are a Premium JBL sound system with nine speakers, connected navigation with over-the-air updates, a wireless cellphone charging pad, ambient interior lighting, passive keyless entry with push-button start, a premium 7-inch TFT (thin-film transistor) configurable instrument cluster display, SofTex Leatherette upholstery, 16-inch alloy wheels, a power moonroof, adaptive front lighting, color-keyed outside mirrors with turn signals and blind-spot monitor, Wi-Fi hotspot and satellite radio.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2020 Toyota Corolla comes with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder in L, LE and XLE trims. This updated engine has a 7-horsepower gain in output and is mated to a CVT. The new 2.0-liter engine offered in the sport versions (SE and XSE), makes 169 horsepower, and offers a choice of a 6-speed manual transmission (in the SE only) or the CVT. The Corolla Hybrid incorporates a 53-kW electric motor with the 1.8-liter engine and a CVT for combined output of 121 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque.

Top 9 Features of the 2020 Toyota Corolla
#1. Spacious
The 2020 Corolla sedan is a compact car, but it’s big enough for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to classify it as a midsize.
#2. Engaging drive
After years of being referred to as a 4-wheeled appliance, the new Corolla now has an element of fun as well as plenty of comfort.
#3. Hybrid model
According to the EPA, the 2020 Corolla Hybrid sedan averages an impressive 52 mpg. And there’s no penalty in trunk space.
#4. Available as a sedan or hatchback body style
The accepted wisdom is that Americans prefer trunks (measuring 13.1 cubic feet, by the way). If some buyers’ tastes skew European, the hatchback offers a handy 23.3 cubic feet of rear storage space.
#5. Driver aids
Every 2020 Corolla has automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, active lane keeping, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control.
#6. Not just a car
Over 11 generations, the Corolla has become the world’s best-selling car. It achieved this by being reliable, sturdy and holding its value. The new-for-2020 Corolla sedan is set to follow the same formula.
#7. Apple CarPlay
Apple CarPlay integrates iPhones to make them controllable from the Corolla’s 7-inch touch screen, or by using voice commands. Standard equipment.
#8. Amazon Alexa
Activated by spoken commands, bringing the ability to lock/unlock doors and check fuel levels remotely. Another standard feature.
#9. Excellent crash test scores
The 2020 Corolla (sedan and hatchback) has the full 5-star overall score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) deems it a “Top Safety Pick.”
 
Overview
The Toyota Corolla has been the Japanese automaker’s mainstay small-car offering for decades, and is one of the best-selling nameplates worldwide. The Corolla has long been known for its practicality, durability and fuel economy. But as the market for small cars shrinks in the United States, Toyota wanted to make the Corolla more enticing by imbuing the model with additional virtues.
First, it launched an all-new 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback last fall, and now Toyota has migrated the Corolla sedan to a slightly longer version of the hatch’s platform, which is known as the Toyota New Generation Architecture. That means the 2020 Toyota Corolla sedan is all-new from the ground up. Although it again uses the 106.3-inch wheelbase of its predecessor, the new model has a lower ride height, shorter front and longer rear overhangs, a wider track and a lower cowl.
There is an updated version of the standard 1.8-liter engine, and the Corolla also boasts a new engine offering: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine on SE and XSE trims. In addition to a larger engine, those sporty trims also (in the SE) offer the availability of a manual transmission, get a firmer chassis setup, and more expressive styling to appeal to the enthusiast set.
Additionally, for the first time there is a Corolla Hybrid model that mates the smaller engine to an electric motor and a battery pack. The hybrid version has fuel economy that approaches that of the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight.
A major effort with this latest redesign has been to infuse some driving excitement into the 2020 Toyota Corolla, thanks to a more sophisticated independent rear suspension that supplants the previous torsion-beam setup and greatly improves the Corolla’s handling. But more important, the new Corolla also seeks to offer class-above comfort in ride and cabin quietness as well as a long list of standard features that enable it to better compete against rivals such as the Honda Civic, as well as entries from Hyundai, Kia and Mazda.
Here’s a more detailed look at how the 2020 Corolla stacks up against some of its key competitors:
COMPARISONS
2020 Toyota Corolla vs. Honda Civic
The new Corolla and the Honda Civic are near mirror-images of each other when it comes to exterior dimensions. The two rivals both ride on a wheelbase of exactly 106.3 inches, and less than a half-inch separates them in overall length. Honda manages to squeeze a bit more interior space out of its similar-sized package, however, with just over two inches more rear-seat legroom and a few inches more shoulder room (headroom and front-seat legroom are similar). The Civic also has a larger trunk at 15.1 cubic feet to the Corolla’s 13.1.
The Civic’s base engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, and its 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque eclipse the output of the 1.8-liter base engine in the Corolla. At Honda, the step-up engine is a smaller 1.5-liter four bolstered by a turbocharger, while Toyota’s optional powerplant is a 2.0-liter four. Here again, the Civic’s output noses ahead of the Corolla’s, with the 1.5-liter turbo making 174 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque.
Both sedans employ a continuously variable automatic (CVT) as their main transmission offering but maintain limited availability of a 6-speed manual. Honda relegates its stick shift to the base engine but offers it in two trim levels, LX and Sport. Toyota pairs its manual transmission with its larger engine in the sport-themed Corolla SE. Unlike the Corolla, the 2020 Civic does not offer a hybrid engine option — instead, the Honda Insight is the brand’s gas-electric small car entry.
In the fuel-economy derby, the Civic and the Corolla are effectively tied when looking at estimates for their standard engines. With its base 2.0-liter, the Civic’s best numbers are 30/38-mpg city/highway, with the CVT. That exactly matches the estimates for the Corolla’s 1.8-liter base engine. The Civic Sport trim level loses one mpg in both measures, as does the Corolla XLE. Civic models with the manual transmission drop further, with estimates of 25/36-mpg city/highway.
Looking at the optional engines, the Civic has an advantage. Its 1.5-liter turbo has EPA estimates of 32-mpg city and 42-mpg highway, although the top-spec Touring model drops down to 30/38 mpg. That beats the Corolla with its 2.0-liter, which maxes out at 31/40-mpg city/highway, with the XSE dropping to 38-mpg highway and the SE manual at 29/36 mpg.
Both the Civic and the Corolla also offer a 4-door hatchback body style in addition to the sedan. Honda goes further by also making available a 2-door coupe, and the Civic’s sporty offerings go further than those of the Corolla, as the high-performance Civic Si and racy Civic Type R have no equivalent counterparts in the Corolla lineup.
Like the Corolla, all models in the Honda Civic family include forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights. The Civic’s infotainment screen in smaller than the Corolla’s, with a 7-inch unit on all but the base car, while the base Toyota gets a 7-inch screen and all other models are upgraded to an 8-inch unit. Honda’s system also is not as easy to use as Toyota’s, although it supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while Toyota’s works with CarPlay only. The two fanciest Civic trim levels, the EX-L and Touring, come with leather seats, while you can’t get leather on the Corolla, only SofTex synthetic leather.

All-wheel drive is optional in each version except Preferred (which turns out not to be the preferred model at all), costing between $2,000 and $2,300 extra, depending on the trim. Every Enclave comes with a 4-year/50,000-mile limited bumper-to-bumper warranty.
At these prices, the Enclave has an advantage of a few thousand dollars over the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60, while looking even more financially attractive against an Audi Q7 or a Volvo XC90. The Mazda CX-9, however, is less expensive than an Enclave and more engaging to drive.
Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Enclave. The Enclave has been an average performer in its class in regard to 5-year cost-to-own figures and is expected to retain at least half its value over three years.

Driving the  2020 Buick EnclaveThe Enclave moves in a smooth, soft and quiet manner. A refined and sophisticated multi-link independent rear suspension not only contributes to the excellent ride quality, but also endows it with the ability to take corners like a much smaller SUV.
GM’s Active Return Assist electric power steering provides useful feedback and requires less effort when bringing the wheel back to the straight-ahead position. And two optional all-wheel-drive systems bring optimum power distribution and traction.
The 3.6-liter V6 generates 310 horsepower, so there’s always sufficient muscle for passing or merging. Front-drive models feel slightly quicker off the line, thanks to the lower weight. Unless potential buyers live in the Snow Belt, the smart choice could be to pass on all-wheel drive, and save money and gas.
A less obvious but no less valid form of reassurance is the excellent outward vision, brought about by large glass areas and relatively thin pillars.
RELATED: Best Midsize Luxury SUVs of 2020
Interior ComfortA crossover SUV with luxury objectives has to have a great interior. The 2020 Enclave doesn’t disappoint. We’ve already mentioned how quiet it is, but other positive traits include soft-touch plastics, chrome and wood accents, and a layered dashboard of a clean, flowing design housing an 8-inch infotainment touch screen.
Between the comfortable front seats is a large center console with plenty of stowage space made possible by an electronic transmission interface using switches instead of a conventional shift lever.
The Enclave doesn’t have a bench in the second row, deploying two sumptuous captain’s chairs instead. The third row provides pleasant seating for two, but will take three if necessary.
Exterior StylingThe long wheelbase (120.9 inches between the axles) works wonders for space and ride quality, but Buick has also managed to dress the 2020 Enclave with smart styling that manages to keep the proportions elegant. LED exterior lighting and twin squared-off, chromed exhaust outlets also help to stop the Enclave from looking dowdy.
The range-topping Avenir trim comes with bigger alloy wheels and a mesh grille.
Favorite FeaturesINTERIOR SPACE
Even for a midsize-crossover SUV, the Buick Enclave is especially spacious. Legroom in the second row is 38.9 inches, while cargo space behind the third seating row is 23.6 cubic feet (more than the Mazda CX-9, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander), expanding to a maximum of 97.6 cubic feet when rows two and three are both folded down.
QUIET TUNING
Buick’s Quiet Tuning is a combination of chassis calibration, body rigidity, laminated glass, active noise cancelation and copious amounts of sound-deadening material. The result is an impressively hushed cabin.
Standard FeaturesIn Preferred trim, the entry-level 2020 Enclave still comes with many features. Such as LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/ignition, programmable power tailgate with gesture control, tri-zone automatic climate control, universal garage-door opener, six USB ports (two per row), OnStar, Wi-Fi, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration.
Standard safety equipment includes rear parking sensors, seven airbags and blind-spot monitoring. Compared with several mainstream rivals, this is a bit sparse. It’s not until the second most expensive trim when basic driver aids like forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking become standard.
Factory OptionsAny buyer who wants to go above Preferred trim will have a choice of all-wheel-drive systems. The Essence trim has the basic setup, while Premium and Avenir have a more sophisticated version.
Other options include the aforementioned Sport Touring package, navigation, upgraded Bose sound system, adaptive cruise control on higher-trim models with full-speed stop-and-go, adaptive suspension, heavy-duty cooling as part of the trailer package, and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionA 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 is the sole engine of the 2020 Enclave lineup, linked to a 9-speed automatic transmission and driving either the front wheels (FWD) in its standard setup, or all four with the optional all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. To help save a little fuel at idling, the engine has a stop/start feature that is one of the smoother examples out there.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates combined (city and highway) fuel consumption for the front-drive version at 21 mpg; the AWD model is expected to achieve 20 mpg. For comparison, the Acura MDX is rated up to 23 mpg for FWD and 22 mpg for AWD and the Toyota Highlander Hybrid can manage 29 mpg combined.
The Enclave has a basic towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. This goes up to 5,000 pounds with the optional trailer towing package that includes additional cooling and other tweaks.

#6 in Best Midsize Luxury SUVs of 2020
There’s a vehicle for virtually every niche. For example, the 2020 Buick Enclave midsize 3-row crossover SUV occupies a sparsely populated area between mainstream models such as the Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9, and true luxury contenders like the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX60, Audi Q7 and Volvo XC90.
Top-trim versions of vehicles like the Toyota Highlander come close, while the swishest Enclave moves toward the established premium examples. Because of this, it might be an easier decision to save a few bucks or go the other way and splash out on the real deal.
Those who do buy a new Enclave will enjoy a spacious and well-stocked cabin, plenty of tech choices, a strong engine and a refined suspension. As a way to have many luxury features without paying the full luxury price, the Enclave could be a good call.

The more recommendable SV begins at $34,470. At the top, a Platinum trim starts at $42,920. Adding all-wheel drive to any model is an extra $1,690. Loaded, a Pathfinder can reach nearly $48,000.
The Nissan Pathfinder’s pricing is similar to that of the Kia Telluride, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Hyundai Palisade, and we would recommend any of those over it because of their added safety features, better technology and overall freshness.

Driving the  2020 Nissan PathfinderIf there’s one trait we still appreciate about the Pathfinder and the way it drives, it’s the standard V6 engine. With 284 horsepower, it’s has a good amount of power. If there’s one thing that we still aren’t hot on, it’s the use of a CVT (continuously variable transmission), a type of automatic with no set gears. Simply put, competitors offer better powertrains. The Kia Telluride also comes with a standard V6, and it is both more powerful and connected to a slick-shifting 8-speed automatic.
For what it’s worth, Nissan’s CVT does a decent job replicating a traditional automatic, and it attains up to 27 mpg. All-wheel-drive Pathfinder models include a full-lock setting for rough or slippery surfaces, making the vehicle suitable for light off-roading. In the usual around-town environments, the ride is composed, but not particularly smooth.
RELATED: Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
Interior ComfortAll 2020 Pathfinder models have a 3-row/7-passenger setup. Unlike competitors, however, the Pathfinder does not offer the choice of replacing the 3-passenger 2nd-row bench with a pair of captain’s seats. That sort of setup enables both more comfort for those in the second row and easy access to the third row. That said, Nissan’s standard EZ Flex seating system does offers easy, tip-up access to the third row. Also unlike competitors, the Pathfinder doesn’t offer an 8-passenger option.
The Pathfinder’s interior is plush but, as with all its other aspects, feels dated. The front console is a bevy of buttons for audio and climate controls, and an 8-inch touch screen is standard. If you’re coming out of a truly old vehicle, say a decade or more, the 2020 Pathfinder might impress. But compared to fresher competitors like the Kia Telluride or 2020 Toyota Highlander, the Pathfinder’s age easily shows.
As for utility, luggage space behind the third row is a useful 16 cubic feet, expanding to 47.8 behind the second. With both rows folded flat, maximum cargo area is 79.8. These specs are good, but again, not as good as a Kia Telluride or Honda Pilot.
Exterior StylingThe Nissan Pathfinder’s exterior remains handsome if unassuming. Like the Pilot, the Pathfinder has a softly rounded shape vs. the tougher and blockier image projected by the Kia Telluride, Ford Explorer and GMC Acadia. The optional dual-pane moonroof on SL and Platinum models brings airiness to the whole cabin, while the gesture-controlled tailgate in those trims is convenient when your hands are full.
The new-for-2020 Pathfinder Rock Creek edition aims to bolster the Pathfinder’s ruggedness with a black grille, roof rails, door handles and other aesthetics, plus a standard tow hitch and splash guards.
Favorite FeaturesREAR-DOOR ALERT
Standard on every 2020 Pathfinder, this feature reminds the driver to check the rear seat for their most precious human cargo before exiting the car. The system takes note if a vehicle’s rear-passenger door was opened at the beginning of a trip, but not at its conclusion.
AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING
Many new vehicles have this feature as standard. But it’s no less welcome because of that. Using a network of sensors, the Pathfinder reads the distance to the vehicle in front, gives audible and visual alerts if that distance is reducing rapidly, then applies the brakes if the driver hasn’t responded in time.
Standard FeaturesThe Nissan Pathfinder is available in four trims: S, SV, SL and Platinum. The least expensive 2020 Pathfinder S model includes cloth upholstery with 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, tri-zone automatic climate control, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors, and an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio with Bluetooth streaming and USB inputs.
As we mentioned, the Pathfinder is among the rare new cars that doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration. If you’re truly set on buying one of these, we’d suggest stepping up to at least an SV trim, which adds 8-way-power driver’s seat, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, fog lights and remote-engine start.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, Pathfinder SL models add navigation and Nissan Connect services with emergency call and stolen-vehicle locator, surround-view monitor, leather seats for the first and second rows, LED headlights, heated front and 2nd-row seats, and heated steering wheel.
Top-line Nissan Pathfinder Platinum trims bring a 13-speaker Bose audio system, heated and cooled front seats, wood-grain interior, and dual-panel panoramic moonroof.
All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on all trims. The new Rock Creek package is optional on SV and SL trims, and adds unique exterior aesthetics and 2-tone interior. The Pathfinder Platinum can be further spruced up with a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Unlike almost every competitor, you can’t even get the latest safety features such as lane-keeping assist and road-departure mitigation on a Pathfinder. On better, more recommendable crossover SUVs like the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Kia Telluride, Hyundai Palisade, Ford Explorer and Subaru Ascent, that kind of active safety system comes standard.
Engine & TransmissionAll new Nissan Pathfinder models use a 3.5-liter V6 engine. It makes a good but not class-leading 284 horsepower. The only transmission is a CVT — a continuously variable unit that tends to drone. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is the basic setup, but AWD is available across the board. If there’s one bright spot with the Pathfinder, it’s the ability to tow 6,000 pounds — which is about 1,000 more than rivals. The Pathfinder also returns good fuel economy, up to 27 mpg on the highway.

#13 in Best Midsize SUVs for 2020
When it was introduced in 2013 as an all-new model, the Nissan Pathfinder impressed us with its strong and standard V6, good fuel efficiency and easy-access 3rd-row seats. Unfortunately, that was seven years ago, and by 2020 standards Nissan’s 3-row crossover SUV hasn’t kept up with fresher, better competitors.
Unlike the amazing new Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade, not to mention longtime benchmarks such as the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander, the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder lacks technology like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and active safety features like lane-departure warning. Surprisingly, these features can be found in a sub-"

The Charger R/T, the lowest-priced Hemi V8 Charger with 375 horsepower, starts at $37,990, while the 485-horsepower Scat Pack starts at $41,990. Finally, the SRT Hellcat begins at $73,590, bubbling over with 707 horsepower.
One caveat, though. While conventional price shopping is one thing, you cannot compare a Dodge Charger Hellcat with other conventional cars. It really competes with upper-end super sedans like the Mercedes E63 AMG that costs well over $100,000.

Driving the  2020 Dodge ChargerStarting with the base and 2nd-level SXT and GT models, the 2020 Dodge Charger accelerates and handles adequately, if without much thrill. Once underway, they shine on the highway, gobbling up miles, where they may also even reach their rated fuel economy number of 30 mpg. But as the road twists, the two lesser trim levels in the Charger range lose out to the middle and upper-level Charger brothers on handling, braking, and a feel of quality. The interiors feel slightly built to a price with middling cloth upholstery. However, if all-wheel drive is a consideration, only the SXT and GT trim levels can be had with this traction-focused system.
Next up the ladder are the Hemi V8 models that start with the R/T, making 370 horsepower from their 5.7-liter engine, which wakes up the performance. Both the aforementioned V6 GT and the V8 R/T offer a Performance Handling Group which adds Bilstein shock absorbers and high-performance suspension tuning, 20 x 9-inch forged alloy wheels with 245/45ZR20 all-season tires, and 4-piston Brembo brakes with fixed calipers, which we’ve driven and recommend highly. Inside, the handling package adds sports seats, a flat-bottomed leather steering wheel with shift paddles, and the Dodge Performance Pages app that keeps tabs on driving performance stats with an 8.4-inch diameter Uconnect infotainment screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also now standard on every Charger model.
The Charger Scat Pack ups the power stakes with a 6.4-liter Hemi V8 knocking out 485 horsepower, plus a completely different suspension with Bilstein shocks. Specific chassis changes from last year’s Scat Pack include 27 percent stiffer front springs with a 52 percent stiffer rear anti-roll bar. This is the sweetest of the many Charger variants, offering eye-opening yet usable performance & handling (0-60 mph in under 4.5 seconds) at a fairly reasonable cost and all the room you could ever expect from today’s sedans. On top of that, the new-for-2020 Charger Scat Pack Widebody adds 3.5-inch wider fender flares, 20×11-inch wheels with 305/35ZR20 Pirelli P-Zero all-season performance tires, and 3-mode Bilstein adaptive shocks with Auto, Sport, and Track modes. The Scat Pack Widebody may yield ride stiffness too severe for some as an everyday car, but it’s still a performance bargain.
Finally, the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat caps off Dodge’s 4-door musclecar lineup, powered by a 6.2-liter Hemi Hellcat V8 making 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. It’s actually only built as a Widebody now, and posts a top speed of 196 mph, reaching 60 mph from rest in just 3.6 seconds, traversing the quarter-mile mark in 10.96 seconds, and posting a maximum lateral acceleration on the skidpad of .96g.
Other Hellcat changes include electric power steering rather than hydraulic, making parking lot maneuvering easier. The effort required of the steering at road speeds can be adjusted by the driver through settings in the onboard Performance Pages app.
While we love all the horsepower we can get and tested both the Scat Pack and Hellcat Widebodies on the racetrack and the road, the Charger Scat Pack with its 485 horsepower was nearly as impressive around the racetrack as the 707 horsepower Hellcat, yet costs nearly $30,000 less, making it a much better realistic deal. Unless you’re at a dragstrip, you’ll never miss the additional 200 horsepower. Really. And no Chevy Impala, Toyota Avalon, or Nissan Maxima could ever elicit the same sort of smile on the driver’s face as can a few brisk minutes with a V8-powered Charger.
No matter which of the four different engines you choose, it will mate up with an adaptive 8-speed automatic with a manual shift mode that never gets in the way. A manual transmission is not offered.
Interior ComfortThe Charger, especially in Scat Pack and Hellcat regalia, is a total extrovert, but inside, it’s fairly businesslike. Akin to its 2-door Challenger brother, the Charger angles the instruments and controls toward the driver. Supportive seats in every trim level are comfortable, though the base SXT trim starts you off in somewhat cheap-feeling cloth. The big 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment touchscreen (optional on a few models, standard on others) is excellent, easy to navigate, and processes input quickly. We highly recommend it. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also now standard on every Charger model. Sportier models get grippy seats which are both comfortable on long drives and supportive when driving briskly, and rear-seat room is just plain ol’ big, even for adults.
Exterior StylingThere’s no mistaking the Dodge Charger for anything but a modern American sedan with sporty intentions. It even glowers at you from the front view. It’s big, but it doesn’t try to hide its size, either. All Chargers have a cove-like indentation at the sides, starting at the front doors, which tapers off in depth as it rises toward the back, accenting a feel of motion and — in yoga terms — a downward dog position. It’s all a fancy way to make it appear planted to the ground, and it works. Subtle changes for 2020 include a revised Hellcat Widebody grille and other minor updates.
Favorite FeaturesVIBRANT COLORS AND COLOR NAMES
Dodge clearly has fun with their cars, and that extends to naming their colors, like Go Man-go (orange), Hellraisin (purple), Cinnamon Stick (copper), ToRed (bright red), and Smoke Show (silver-gray).
BIG V8s
Three different V8s are offered in the Charger, capped by the bonkers 707-horsepower, supercharged Hellcat engine (717 hp in limited Daytona Anniversary trim), but the sweetest model that hits all the marks best and still costs in the low $40,000s is the 485-hp Charger Scat Pack.
Standard FeaturesMost notably, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are all now standard across the whole Charger range, including the base SXT sedan. Rear parking sensors, LED daytime running lights, a noise-reducing windshield, and front side glass, 7-inch infotainment touchscreen with Uconnect 4 are all standard now on the base 2020 Dodge Charger SXT.
Factory OptionsTrim levels from SXT, GT, R/T, Scat Pack, and Hellcat are also tethered to an increasing list of options that become standard as you walk up those levels, in addition to engine choices. But the bigger single options include higher-power and multiple-speaker audio systems from either Alpine or Harman Kardon. The big packages include the Performance Handling Group, Navigation, and Technology Group, which bundles the higher-tech active safety systems like adaptive cruise control with forward-collision warning and braking and lane departure warning. (Though blind-spot monitoring and cross-path detection are in the Driver Convenience Group and Plus Group and should really be in one group with the other active safety features.)
Engine & TransmissionFour distinct engines are available in the 2020 Dodge Charger. Starting with the SXT and GT, the 3.6-liter V6 with 292 horsepower (300 in the SXT with all-wheel drive and the GT), offering adequate power and quite decent highway fuel economy for the car’s size. The R/T model comes with the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 370 horsepower. Scat Pack models come with the 6.4-liter Hemi, making a stout 485 horsepower. Finally, the 6.2-liter supercharged, intercooled, and rip-snorting SRT Hellcat has 707 horsepower (and a slight boost to 717 in the Daytona 50th Anniversary). All engines are backed up by an 8-speed automatic transmission that rarely puts a foot wrong. No manual transmission is offered.

A wide-body option on Scat Pack and Hellcat models inspired by the Challenger Widebody adds big fender flares, Brembo brakes, suspension changes, and larger wheels & tires.
Electrically boosted power steering (rather than hydraulic power) is added to the Hellcat.
A new Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition of the Hellcat gets unique paint, graphics, and 717 horsepower.
All Scat Pack versions get suspension tweaks, including spring rates, shock damping, and other minor changes.

In the grand scheme of things, Dodge’s Charger is the last of the traditional big American sedans. Though not as huge as the land yachts that wafted over American highways from the 1950s through the 1980s, the 2020 Dodge Charger is still actually longer than its Dodge Durango 3-row SUV stablemate. And because of the giant market shift to SUVs where conventional cars are generally smaller than a generation ago, it changes the direct competition to cars like the Kia Stinger, Chevrolet Impala, Toyota Avalon, and Nissan Maxima. The Charger enjoys excellent interior space for front and rear passengers and also offers a huge trunk.
And while the base model comes standard with a comparatively modest 292-horsepower V6 engine (and rated at 300-hp when paired with optional all-wheel drive), the Charger’s overall design is far sportier than most family sedans. But where the automotive gods giveth, they taketh away, too. The Charger always has a bit of throwback in its proverbial soup, feeling a bit rougher around the edges than the latest Honda Accord, Chevy Impala, or Toyota Avalon in the large sedan class and fares less well on resale value, reliability, and the latest in fuel-efficient engine technology, though many enthusiasts flock to the Charger’s powerful V8s for a fix of massive power.
But out on the road, the Charger becomes a very good highway cruiser, especially the more modest V6 versions. They never lose their sense of size, always feeling big and heavy, but the Scat Pack and Hellcat Chargers basically defy the laws of physics in the handling gambit. They weigh well over 4,000 pounds, yet grip and change direction over twisty roads with astonishing ability. No one will ever confuse it for a sports car weighing 1,000 to 1,500 pounds less, but you can’t stuff five people and their luggage into a 2-seat sports car, either.

If you only need two rows and seating for five, you can shave $4,200 off that price with the Custom Edition.
Most buyers, however, will be better off in the more recommendable Tahoe LT. That midgrade variant offers more features and amenities, and starts just over $54,000.
Top-line Tahoe Premier editions bow at nearly $64,000. Adding 4-wheel drive to any model is an extra $3,000. If you want the special-edition Tahoe RST with the bigger 6.2-liter V8 engine on your Premier model, plan on spending over $70,000.
At its starting point, a 3-row Tahoe SUV begins slightly above the Nissan Armada, and a bit below its GMC Yukon twin and the better-equipped Toyota Sequoia, and a few thousand less than the Ford Expedition, which was also a 2019 Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Winner.
Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new SUV. The Chevy Tahoe’s resale value is very strong. In fact, in 2019 it earned the top spot in its class for Kelley Blue Book’s Best Resale Value Awards.

Driving the  2020 Chevrolet TahoeThe Tahoe drives quite a bit better than you might expect for a big, truck-based body-on-frame SUV, and certainly better than its predecessors. While not quite as comfortable as a car-based crossover SUV, today’s Tahoe rides admirably. This is truer still if you opt for the Magnetic Ride Control suspension that comes on the top-line Premier trim. There’s no getting around the Tahoe’s girth that can make it a handful in parking lots and other tight spaces, but its steering is light and makes piloting this ship seamless.
On the highway, the Tahoe is refined and quiet. The standard 5.3-liter V8 engine remains a gratifying powerhouse, and its 6-speed automatic transmission is a mostly smooth operator. We’ve tested the Tahoe over hill and dale and while towing off-road vehicles, and it’s always up to the task.
For even more potency, the Tahoe can now be had with GM’s more powerful 6.2-liter V8, which is used in the Cadillac Escalade and has already been available in the GMC Yukon. Equipped with this 420-horsepower engine as part of the special edition RST Performance Package, the Tahoe Premier model really gets up and goes, hitting 0-60 mph in less than six seconds. The RST — Rally Sport Truck — treatment is also available without the engine upgrade on Tahoe LT and Premier models.
Interior ComfortOne of the leading reasons people love the 2020 Chevy Tahoe is its massive interior. Among its non-GM peers, the Tahoe is the only full-size SUV that can accommodate up to nine passengers, a feat made possible by the LS trim’s available 3-person front bench seat. While the Tahoe’s third row isn’t as comfortable or roomy as the one in the Ford Expedition, it still serves as a suitable perch for kids or pets. Most Tahoe models seat eight, but there is a 5-passenger version that omits the rearmost seat, saving money and gaining cargo space.
 Speaking of space, with the 3rd-row in place, there’s a paltry 15.3 cubic feet left for gear. However, with said seat folded or removed, cargo capacity jumps to a massive 51.7 cubic feet.
 As for passenger comfort, we think most will find the Tahoe’s seats both wide and supportive. Those who need the convenience of a tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel and power-adjustable pedals will need to move up to the LT or Premier trims. Storage space is ample, thanks in part to the column-mounted gear selector that frees up space in the center console.
Exterior StylingFew SUVs look as SUV-like as the Chevy Tahoe. Big, blocky and bold, it is the pictorial definition of what many envision when they think of a traditional sport-utility vehicle. We like the Tahoe’s sharp-edged styling, sculpted flanks and new LED daytime running lights. The Tahoe looks wider than its GMC Yukon sibling thanks to the wide grille that blends into the headlights. Shorter drivers will love the available power running boards. Tahoe RST models add aggressive aesthetics like a black grille, mirror caps and bow-tie badges, and 22-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesCHEVY MYLINK Of the numerous infotainment setups we’ve tested, the MyLink system in the 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV is hands-down one of the best. It’s easy to use and navigate, with quick response times and big, colorful graphics. The system is not only compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, it also offers onboard 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and voice activation.
 6.2-LITER V8 ENGINEOnce offered only in the Cadillac Escalade and GMC Denali, the big 6.2-liter V8 is now available in the Tahoe as part of the Premier’s RST with Performance Package option. With 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, this engine can handle the biggest jobs while pushing acceleration times into sports-car territory. The engine also comes with a 10-speed automatic transmission and Magnetic Ride Control suspension.
Standard FeaturesFor 2020 the Tahoe is available in three main trims: LS, LT and Premier. At its least expensive, a Tahoe LS includes cloth seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry, rearview camera and rear parking sensors, cruise control, and the MyLink 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility and 6-speaker audio system.
 If you can afford roughly $5,000 more, we recommend stepping up to at least the Tahoe LT trim. It adds safety features like forward-collision alert and lane-keeping systems, plus amenities such as leather seating, power tailgate, Bose 9-speaker audio system, telescoping steering wheel and power-adjustable pedals, memory seating and universal garage-door opener. The LT trim also opens the door to options like 2nd-row bucket seats, sunroof and more.
Factory OptionsThe top-line Tahoe Premier comes with many of the amenities that are optional on the LT, including hands-free tailgate, navigation, blind-spot monitoring, keyless start, and heated steering wheel. Exclusive to the Premier are Magnetic Ride Control, high-intensity headlights, ventilated front seats, 10-speaker Bose audio, and optional power-retractable side steps. You’ll also need the Premier trim if you want adaptive cruise control and advanced high-speed autonomous braking.
If you go with the base LS trim, we highly recommend adding the Enhanced Driver Alert Package. For just $695 it adds forward-collision alert with low-speed forward emergency braking, power-adjustable pedals, lane-keep assist, lane-departure warning, and more.
Four-wheel drive can be had on all three trims instead of the standard 2-(rear)-wheel drive, and the optional Z71 off-road package amplifies the Tahoe’s capabilities with skidplates, upgraded suspension, hill-descent control and more.
The Tahoe RST edition is available on LT or Premier trims, but to add the 6.2-liter engine you’ll need to step up to the Premier. A rear-seat entertainment system with Blu-ray player and wireless headphones is available on LT and Premier trims.
Engine & TransmissionTwo V8 engines are available for the 2020 Chevy Tahoe. Most are powered by a 5.3-liter 355-horsepower V8 with high-tech fuel injection that enhances both fuel economy and power; it also features GM’s Active Cylinder Management, which imperceptibly shuts off half the cylinders under steady cruise to help preserve fuel. This engine works with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and while it’s relatively smooth, we do wish GM would offer the excellent 8-speed automatic that’s been available in some Silverado pickup models.
 Order the RST special edition and opt for the Performance Package, and the Tahoe Premier model gets the 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 and 10-speed automatic from the Cadillac Escalade. Two-wheel (2WD) and 4-wheel drive (4WD) with a proper low range for real off-road duty are available. With either engine the Tahoe is rated to tow up to 8,600 pounds in 2WD form, while 4-wheel-drive Tahoe models max out at 8,400 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?
Other than the deletion of some packages and regrouping of features, the 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV carries over with no changes of note.

With its attractive styling, capable interior and powerful standard V8 engine, the 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe remains one of the best full-size SUVs money can buy. Because it’s constructed atop a rugged truck-like frame, the Tahoe can haul and tow far more weight than a conventional crossover SUV like the Chevy Traverse or Honda Pilot. However, when it comes to trailering bragging rights, the Ford Expedition’s 9,300-pound rating beats out the Tahoe’s 8,600-pound limit.
While not as fuel-efficient as the Ford, the Tahoe’s standard V8 falls squarely in line with similar engines offered in the Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. There’s also an optional 6.2-liter V8 in the RST package that bumps horsepower to 420.

Driving the  2020 Hyundai Sonata HybridAfter driving the Sonata in multiple locations and over hundreds of miles, we can assert that its manners are right up there with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. If we’re splitting hairs, we’d say its personality is in the middle of those two — slightly less sporty than an Accord and the slightest bit less comfortable than a Camry. We see this as more of an asset than a fault, similar to the way Audi splits the difference between BMW and Mercedes among luxury cars.
Our seat time was in Sonata models with the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder turbo engine, which comes in SEL Plus and Limited models. This engine has less horsepower than the standard 2.5-liter, but more torque. This leads to smooth and confident acceleration from a stop, and enough in reserve for good if not great passing power. All models use an 8-speed automatic transmission that is seamless. The cabin is acceptably quiet, though we did notice modest wind noise from the driver-side door at elevated highway speeds.
One of the Sonata’s best driving features is its ability to take on much of the task itself. The Highway Drive Assist — standard in Limited models and optional in the SEL Plus — is among the better semi-autonomous systems. Returning to California from Arizona, we basically let the Sonata do most of the driving while keeping our hands on the wheel. Its adaptive cruise control paced the vehicle in front, and its lane-centering system kept the new Sonata centered and sure. It also worked well in stop-and-go traffic, though initially activating the Smart Cruise Control took a couple of tries.
We also spent some time in a 2020 Sonata Hybrid, a top-of-the-line Limited model. Our quick take: It feels much like a standard Sonata Limited that gets phenomenal fuel economy.
If you’re used to the smooth power delivery of a Prius or any other hybrid with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), the silky shifts of the Sonata Hybrid’s standard automatic make this Hyundai feel more like a car with a conventional drivetrain. The Sonata Hybrid Limited also has a 205-watt Solar Panel roof that charges the car’s 12-volt and hybrid lithium-ion batteries. Besides looking techy, the Solar Roof gives the new Sonata Hybrid a couple of extra miles of range per day, or about 700 “free” miles over the course of a year. Pretty nifty.
RELATED: Best Midsize Cars of 2020
Interior ComfortThe Sonata’s 5-passenger cabin has an open and contemporary design. The driver’s spot is a nice place to be, and we found the seat comfortable even after hours behind the wheel. Part of the Sonata’s airy feel can be attributed to its transmission selector, or lack thereof. Instead of a traditional lever, there are buttons. This setup takes some getting used to, but we did and think it is among the better executed of such layouts.
In the center of the dash is the infotainment screen — a commendable eight inches as standard or a large and crisp 10.25-inch version that’s optional on SEL Plus and standard on Limited models. Controls to adjust common functions like volume and climate are easy to see and use, though we wish there were also a dial for radio tuning and track selection.
On paper the Sonata’s rear-seat legroom pales to the Accord’s — 34.8 inches vs. 40.4 — but in reality still feels accommodating for adults. Furthermore, the Hyundai gives back that room up front, with 46.1 inches for driver and passenger vs. the Accord’s 42.3.
Exterior StylingWell, what do you think? Just look at that sinister, sultry front end, those LED running lights that extend up the hood and meet at a chrome strip that runs the rest of the way up the sides. Hyundai’s design executive said the team aimed for “sensuous sportiness” with this all-new Sonata. In a way it’s also a return to form and daring design, similar to the 6th-gen version that made waves back in 2011.
The front end will certainly be loved or loathed, but we think other elements of the new Sonata will be generally liked. Its side profile, like so many other sedans these days, strives to be a coupe, while its rear is nice and tucked with an almost-fastback profile.
Pro tip for spotters: Base Sonatas have a single, hidden tailpipe and grille with brightwork, while all other models have a gloss-black grille and twin-tip exhaust outlets.
Note: The new 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is distinguished by a revised grille, unique wheels and a rear spoiler that helps lower the coefficient of drag to an impressive 0.24. Also, the Solar Roof on the Hybrid Limited model is a design element unto itself.
Favorite FeaturesHYUNDAI DIGITAL KEY
No key? No problem. This feature — standard on all but base SE trims — turns your phone into a key, and also allows you to grant access to the Sonata for friends and family via their phone. At present it only works for the Android operating system, but also included is a hotel-like key card that also allows entry and activation.
BLIND-VIEW MONITOR
This class-exclusive feature, standard on Limited models, takes blind-spot monitoring to a whole new level. When you activate the turn signal, a real-time image of the left or right lane is displayed directly in front of you in the all-digital instrument cluster.
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Hyundai Sonata lineup is refreshingly simple, spanning these four trims: SE, SEL, SEL Plus and Limited. At its most basic, a Sonata SE includes the standard tech you want such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, plus 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat and LED headlights and taillights.
Also standard is a full suite of active safety and driver-assist features, including lane-keeping assist, forward-collision alert with automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go. As with all new Hyundais, the Sonata has a class-leading warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain.
Factory OptionsWhile the SE is solid, we’d recommend stepping up to at least an SEL trim. For $2,100 more, it adds blind-spot monitoring with collision-avoidance assist, heated front seats, 8-way-power driver’s seat, heated side mirrors, rear-seat armrest with cup holders, enhanced infotainment system with satellite radio and Blue Link remote vehicle access, dual-zone climate control, and proximity key with push-button start.
From there, the SEL Plus trim includes the turbo engine, fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster, the Digital Key (see Favorite Features), suede/Leatherette upholstery, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, rear-seat air vents (optional on SEL trims), auto-dimming rearview mirror, wireless phone charger, and body-color/satin-chrome door handles.
At the top, Sonata Limited models include the Blind View Monitor, leather interior, panoramic sunroof, head-up display, power-adjust passenger seat, surround-view rearview camera, ventilated front seats and heated steering wheel, 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, and 12-speaker Bose audio system. A seriously slick feature found in the Limited model is Remote Smart Parking Assist, which lets you drive the Sonata in and out of tight spaces while standing outside the vehicle. Using the key fob, it’s like the world’s biggest RC car.
Engine & TransmissionFor its debut year, the 8th-generation Hyundai Sonata offers a choice of two engines. SE and SEL models use a new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that makes 191 horsepower, while SEL Plus and Limited models come with a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 180 horsepower. While the higher-trim turbo engine has less horsepower, it offers more torque — 195 lb-ft compared to 181 lb-ft — which enables better off-the-line acceleration. All 2020 Sonatas are front-wheel drive and use an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission.
The new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is the one exception. It uses a 6-speed automatic transmission (with paddle shifters) that mates to a hybrid powertrain featuring a 2.0-liter gasoline engine and a 51-horsepower electric motor. Combined output is 192 horsepower.
The upcoming N Line Sonata will use a turbocharged version of the 2.5-liter engine that makes an estimated 290 horsepower.

2020 Hyundai Sonata is all-new
Marks eighth generation of Hyundai’s midsize sedan
Debuts with choice of two engines

#2 in Best Midsize Cars of 2020
The Hyundai Sonata is all-new for 2020, marking the eighth generation of this midsize family sedan. Again in its sights are the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, formidable rivals to be sure. But as we’ve come to expect from Hyundai, it is playing to win. That mindset has manifested in the best Sonata yet, one that brings loads of safety equipment in even its least expensive form, and unexpected technology and amenities in its highest trim. There’s also a 2020 Sonata Hybrid that gets up to 53 mpg on the highway. Furthermore, the goods come at a price that still undercuts competitors.
Part of the 2020 Hyundai Sonata’s revamp is a sleek new exterior design that will surely bring differences of opinion. Let your eyes decide. And if you’re among the few drivers seeking a manual-transmission family sedan, you’ll have to look to the Honda. Those factors aside, the 2020 Hyundai Sonata is a complete package and then some, and still boasts the best warranty in the business.

Driving the  2020 Mitsubishi OutlanderWith only 166 horsepower from the engine residing in most trims, the midsize 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander isn’t the most powerful SUV in its class; in fact, it’s one of the weakest. As many compacts are now blurring the line between compact and midsize, one might find comparisons with crossover SUVs like the Subaru Forester, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, but even these have more power than the Outlander’s 2.4-liter engine produces.
The standard continuously variable transmission (CVT) is a good one and helps the Outlander achieve respectable fuel-economy figures nearing 30-mpg highway.
If you find you need more muscle, we suggest moving up to the GT trim with its 3.0-liter V6 engine and conventional 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy drops only a few mpg, which we think is a good trade-off for the added power.
Another option is pricey, but greener. The Outlander PHEV employs a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and electric motor/hybrid system for a combined output of 190 horsepower. The added boost in torque from the electric motors aids in acceleration, and the Outlander PHEV can travel up to 22 miles solely on electric power. Unfortunately, this setup doesn’t do much to improve fuel economy, with an EPA estimated 25-mpg combined rating.
Interior ComfortSmall but noteworthy changes have taken place inside the Outlander for 2020. Most appreciated is the new driver’s seat power-lumbar support, which is now standard on all trims. Rear A/C vents, illuminated window switches and a driver-controlled automatic up/down switch for all windows are also standard, something many competitors offer only on top-line trims.
All 2020 Mitsubishi Outlanders are 7-seaters except for the PHEV, which is a 5-seater. The interior is handsome, and access to the small third row is easy. Fold down both rows of seats and there’s more than 63 cubic feet of available cargo space.
Exterior StylingAlthough the Outlander doesn’t particularly stand out in a class that includes the Chevrolet Blazer, Hyundai Santa Fe and to a lesser degree, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester, it does have a clean look that has recently been improved with an updated grille and headlights, plus revised 18-inch alloy wheels. This Mitsubishi is understatedly handsome, and people who live in, say, Buffalo, will appreciate the electric de-icer that keeps ice and snow from building up on the windshield wipers. The plug-in hybrid Outlander is distinguished by unique badging, plus a charge port hidden behind what looks like an additional fuel door.
Favorite FeaturesFORWARD-COLLISION MITIGATION
Now standard on all but the base ES trim, forward-collision mitigation with pedestrian detection can help avoid a collision with a car or person. The system will first warn the driver and, if no action is taken, it will automatically apply the brakes to avoid impact or lessen the severity of an unavoidable collision.
MULTI-VIEW CAMERA SYSTEM
Available only on the SEL and GT, this multi-view camera provides a bird’s-eye view of the vehicle, making it easier to perform difficult parking maneuvers as well as negotiate narrow thruways or off-road obstacle courses.
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander is available as an ES, SE, LE, SEL or GT; the PHEV comes only as an SEL or a GT. Base ES models are reasonably well-equipped with a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, driver’s seat power-lumbar support, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth, heated front seats and side mirrors, and 18-inch alloy wheels.
The better-equipped SE adds an 8-inch touch screen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, forward-collision mitigation, lane-departure warning, auto high beams, rain-sensing wipers, dual USB ports and push-button start.
The LE is even more thoroughly equipped, thanks to a sunroof, black exterior accents, a black headliner and safety features that include blind-spot monitoring, lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.
The SEL adds power front seats, optional leather interior trim and an available upgraded Mitsubishi Power Sound audio system.
In addition to the V6, Outlander GTs get LED headlights, power-folding mirrors and a conventional 6-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters.
Outlander PHEVs have DC Quick Charging capability, but only the GT has outlets in the rear seat and cargo areas to power electric devices.
Factory OptionsTwo primary option packages are available, the most comprehensive being the SEL Touring Package. For $3,000, Outlander buyers get LED headlights and fog lights, a power glass sunroof, the Mitsubishi Power Sound audio upgrade, a heated steering wheel and the multi-view camera system and adaptive cruise control. The SE Convenience Package pairs a glass sunroof with rear cross-traffic alert and lane-change assist and is attractively priced at $1,000. Pearl White paint is a $395 option.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2020 Outlander, in ES, SE, LE and SEL forms, is powered by a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that sends 166 horsepower to the front or all wheels (FWD, AWD) via a CVT. All-wheel-drive versions all use Mitsubishi’s improved Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup with Active Yaw Control. The 2.4-liter engine burns regular unleaded gasoline and it gives the Outlander a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds.
The Outlander GT, with its 224-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 engine, ups that to 3,500 pounds, but it does require premium fuel. The GT’s transmission is a conventional 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters.
As for the plug-in hybrid version of the Outlander, it pairs a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with two electric motors. This Outlander PHEV can run on electricity alone for up to 22 miles. When using the electrified powertrain in conjunction with the gasoline engine, which is most of the time, the Outlander hybrid has a range of 310 miles. Recharging takes around eight hours with a standard 120-volt outlet.

Mitsubishi may not be the best-known brand in the U.S., but it is still here and it is still building budget-conscious vehicles backed by a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV is a prime example.
This midsize-crossover SUV competes with the likes of the Chevrolet Blazer and Nissan Murano, but unlike those two it offers 7-passenger seating as well as something no other vehicle of this size does: a plug-in hybrid model capable of traveling up to 22 miles solely on electric power.
To its credit, the Outlander is somewhat uncommon, a fact that helps its otherwise generic styling stand out in a crowded parking lot full of Hyundai Santa Fes and Toyota RAV4s.

 The 2020 Hyundai Veloster N starts at $28,320. When ordered with the $2,100 Performance package, the new N climbs to $30,420, which is still thousands less expensive than its obvious competitor, the Honda Civic Type R.
 The Veloster also undercuts the VW GTI and Subaru WRX, but remains competitively priced against the Mazda3, Toyota Corolla hatchback and Subaru BRZ. 
There’s plenty of value in this sport hatch that’s further enhanced by Hyundai’s 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain guarantee.
Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As for resale, the Veloster holds slightly better-than-average numbers, on par with the VW Golf GTI and Toyota 86, but well below the Honda Civic Type-R and Subaru WRX.

Driving the  2020 Hyundai VelosterOne of the most significant changes made to last year’s all-new model was the addition of a multi-link independent rear suspension. As a result, the 2020 Hyundai Veloster has a more planted feel when you’re pushing it. Other improvements include better steering response, though it still could be sharpened to European levels.
The Turbo models pump out 201 horsepower from 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, while the standard, normally aspirated 2.0-liter models make 147 horsepower. The Turbo models aren’t that much more expensive and offer levels of performance more in line with the vehicle’s looks.
Overall, the Veloster feels light on its feet and is easy to drive quickly, but also has a stiff feel to the body and chassis. Hyundai has done an excellent job of controlling noise, vibration and harshness. There’s very little wind or tire noise transmitted to the cabin. Given its price point, if you had your eyes closed, you’d swear you were in a class-above car.
The Turbo R-Spec model comes with the much-improved 6-speed manual transmission, while higher-spec Turbo models are equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that has both paddles for shifting and a sequential mode on the gear selector. The Veloster features Normal, Sport and Smart driving modes — in Sport, the exhaust note is a bit louder and amplified through the sound system. The drive modes make a noticeable difference in throttle response and the shift points of the dual-clutch automatic.
The performance-oriented Veloster N, particularly when equipped with the optional Performance package and its electronic limited-slip differential, feels totally at home on a racetrack, yet it does not beat you up with overly stiff suspension in everyday driving. With 250 horsepower under the hood, the N is the most powerful trim in the Veloster lineup.
This is a car that has been tuned on the famous Nürburgring in Germany, and it shows. Each downshift of the 6-speed manual transmission is accompanied by an automatic throttle blip, and the chassis responds beautifully to steering inputs. Perhaps most important, the electronically controlled differential allows the driver to power out of tight corners without inducing any of the wild inside wheelspin so common with other powerful front-wheel-drive cars.
Interior ComfortThe Veloster interior is as intriguing and fun to look at as its exterior. The quality (and color) of the materials is first-rate, with abundant soft-touch surfaces for fingers and elbows. A twin-cockpit design separates the driver and passenger, with a wide plastic console wall isolating the passenger from easily getting to some controls.
Speaking of controls, we love how Hyundai has retained so many knobs, buttons and switches for the audio and climate systems, yet still manages to integrate a modern touch-screen infotainment display (seven inches on the base and eight inches on all others). There’s even an available head-up display showing safety, navigation and radio readouts. Switch to Sport mode and the display changes to an analog tach and digital speedometer.
Exterior StylingCompared to its first generation, the 2020 Hyundai Veloster has a much bolder and aggressive look thanks to its larger, cascading grille design that features a mesh insert. There are also larger lower inlets and supplemental slots to improve front wheel-arch aerodynamics, adding to the more muscular appearance.
The Veloster also sports a more sharply raked roofline, a rear deck-top spoiler, and a more pronounced rear diffuser and twin round center-mounted exhaust tips. There are LED daylight running lights and taillights, while LED main lighting is an option.
Beefy 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels contribute to the Veloster’s hunkered-down stance. The Turbo Ultimate model is further distinguished by a black roof.
The 2020 Veloster N is distinguished by its N-design front fascia and grille with brake-cooling ducts, along with LED headlights, unique rocker sills, and ultra-high-performance tires — 225/40R-18 Michelin Pilot SuperSport on the standard N and 235/35R-19 Pirelli P-Zeros on the N with the Performance package. In back, the N sports LED taillights, a large rear spoiler, an integrated diffuser and high-flow dual exhaust.
The N is available in black, white, red or blue, the last a light hue that reminds of the famous Gulf Oil livery of the legendary Porsche 917 race car.
Favorite FeaturesDOOR CONFIGURATION The 2020 Hyundai Veloster’s unique, long driver’s door is complemented on the passenger side by a 2-door setup. The design makes it much easier to load people, pets or things into the Veloster’s back seat, while giving the driver a longer window where the B-pillar doesn’t block his or her view.
 THE N PERFORMANCE PACKAGEFor a mere $2,100, the Veloster N Performance package adds 25 horsepower to the standard N model, as well as a limited-slip differential, 19-inch alloy wheels surrounded by Pirelli P Zero performance summer tires and large, vented front and rear brakes. Talk about track-ready!
Standard FeaturesFor 2020 the Hyundai Veloster comes in six trim levels: 2.0 Base, 2.0 Premium, Turbo R-Spec, Turbo, Turbo Ultimate and N. Even Base models benefit from such upscale safety features as forward-collision avoidance with automatic braking, lane-keeping assist, and automatic headlights.
Premium and up models get blind-spot collision warning as well as rear cross-traffic collision warning. A Driver Attention Warning system is standard on all models, monitoring your driving and alerting you when it’s time to take a break.
Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility come with all models, as well as cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity, and LCD touch screens.
Base models have 17-inch alloys while all other models come with 18-inch rims.
Factory OptionsUp-level models can be had with features like wireless charging, proximity keys with push-button start, Infinity premium audio with eight speakers, a sunroof, heated seats, automatic climate control, rain-sensing wipers and LED headlights.
Also available are Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires on the 6-speed-manual Turbo R-Spec and Turbo Ultimate models, smart cruise control on 7-speed automatic models, a 4.2-inch TFT (thin-film transistor) digital display in the instrument cluster and the 8.0-inch head-up display.
The N is available with the Performance package, which includes an electronic limited-slip differential, adjustable dampers, larger brakes, an active exhaust and 19-inch wheels shod with Pirelli P Zero tires, size 235/35R-19.
Engine & TransmissionPower for the 2020 Hyundai Veloster coupe comes from a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 147 horsepower. This engine is standard in both the base and Premium trims.
The Turbo, Turbo R-Spec and Turbo Ultimate all employ a more robust 201-horsepower 1.6-liter turbocharged four, with the R-Spec hooked to a 6-speed manual and the others a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.
At the top of the Veloster food chain is the sporty N that gets a turbo-4 2.0-liter engine good for 250 horsepower (275 with the Performance package). This engine is only available with a 6-speed manual transmission.

Unlike most sporty small coupes, the 2020 Hyundai Veloster distinguishes itself by a unique rear door on the passenger side. Although this design doesn’t detract from the Veloster’s overall good looks, it definitely makes it easier for people and things to move in and out of the rear seat.
Various trim levels bring various levels of performance, allowing the Veloster to appeal to first-time buyers as well as performance junkies looking for a fast, but inexpensive ride.
Up against more expensive, sedan-based rivals like the Subaru WRX and hatchback Honda Civic Type R, the Veloster comes up a bit short in the horsepower department, but it’s still quite quick and its price undercuts the WRX, GTI and Civic Type R by thousands of dollars.

Driving the  2020 Ford ExpeditionThere’s no denying the expansive size of the 2020 Expedition, but that doesn’t automatically mean lumbering weight. The combination of aluminum-intensive construction, turbocharged V6 engine and 10-speed transmission doesn’t exactly make the Expedition sprightly, but it’s more responsive and accelerative than its dimensions might suggest.
Things like moving off from a stoplight or merging onto a freeway are all tackled with confidence. The steering and brakes are also well calibrated, making the Expedition a pleasure to drive rather than a mere task.
Naturally, there’s some body roll, but the Expedition’s independent rear suspension and adjustable shocks mean it’s not to the same extent as a Toyota Sequoia or Chevy Tahoe.
For greater reassurance, we recommend opting for the 360-degree camera system.
Interior ComfortThere’s a premium look and feel to the 2020 Expedition’s cabin. It’s achieved in part by knurled surfaces of the controls for things like volume, temperature, gearshift and the driving-mode selector. And there’s no shortage of features, especially in the high-end Platinum model.
Second-row passengers enjoy comfortable seats with plenty of scope for adjustment and up to 42.6 inches of legroom. Circus entertainers can leave their stilts on (an exaggeration, but you get the idea). Passengers in the third row also have spacious quarters, especially in long-wheelbase Max versions.
Cargo area is similarly ample: 20.9 cubic feet, expanding to 104.6 behind the front seats.
Exterior StylingInstead of employing the design language of Ford’s F-150 pickup, which provides the foundation for the Expedition, the company chose to keep all its SUVs in one stylistic camp. So there’s a family resemblance to the Explorer in the overall profile and lighting units. And we’d argue that this is a good thing, since the 2020 Expedition exhibits a certain boldness and sophistication.
To some, Platinum models might be a bit too lavish with the chrome, but it almost gets lost among the wide expanses of sheetmetal. Expedition Max models have more of everything, with a longer wheelbase and additional cargo space.
Favorite FeaturesINDEPENDENT REAR SUSPENSION
The Expedition’s rear axles move independently. Unlike the solid axles on the Tahoe, Sequoia and Suburban. This brings benefits in ride and handling as well as enabling a flat cargo space when the 3rd-row seats are folded down.
BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO
This high-end audio make is more often associated with high-end names like Audi and Aston Martin. Now a fabulous 12-speaker B&O setup is available in the Ford Expedition.
Standard FeaturesThe big change here for the 2020 Expedition is that the whole lineup receives a set of driver-assistance features as standard. Under the term Ford Co-Pilot360, buyers acquire forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assistance and automatic high beams. Elsewhere in the safety department, the Expedition also has a rearview camera with grid lines and washer, multiple airbags, post-crash alert for emergency response, and trailer-sway control.
Other features in the entry-level XLT trim include power-folding 3rd-row seats, keyless entry/ignition, Bluetooth phone/audio, four USB ports, AM/FM/MP3/CD player and satellite radio, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, and a 6-speaker audio system.
Factory OptionsPerhaps the first option to consider in the 2020 Expedition is all-wheel drive, which comes with a terrain-management system. Features like leather upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, panoramic sunroof and heated/ventilated front seats are standard in the higher trims but available as options at the lower levels.
The Limited trim is eligible for the FX4 off-road package, plus the Texas and Stealth cosmetic packages. King Ranch has its own theme that involves a distinctive black/brown leather combination. Platinum models ramp up the luxury ambience even more with retractable running boards and active noise cancellation.
Other extras include a dual-headrest rear-seat entertainment system and 2nd-row captain’s chairs.
Engine & TransmissionOne engine powers the 2020 Ford Expedition range. It’s a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 generating 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. In Platinum models, it’s tuned for 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. That’s a lot of muscle, even for a full-size SUV. And the Expedition makes good use of it, thanks to a 10-speed automatic transmission.
Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is the basic setup, with all-wheel drive (AWD) on the options list. This system comes with a terrain-response function to maximize traction on different surfaces.
Considering the Expedition’s size, fuel economy is pretty good, averaging up to 23 mpg on the highway.

XLT trim becomes eligible for a Black Accent cosmetic package

The 2020 Ford Expedition takes the 20th-century idea of an 8-seater full-size American SUV and brings it bang up to date. It does this by deploying aluminum body panels, a fuel-efficient turbocharged engine, driver-assistance technology, and a sophisticated independent rear suspension. So even though it’s still based on a truck platform, its refinement is readily apparent. The Expedition Max versions are longer, providing more space for passengers and cargo.
The main competition in this sector comes from the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer Suburban variant, plus the extremely similar GMC Yukon and Yukon XL. Compared with those rivals, the Expedition has a higher tow rating, superior ride and handling, a level cargo floor and tolerable fuel economy.
There’s also another plus point. Kelley Blue Book gave the 2019 Expedition its Full-Size SUV Best Buy award.

Driving the  2020 Hyundai SonataAfter driving the Sonata in multiple locations and over hundreds of miles, we can assert that its manners are right up there with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. If we’re splitting hairs, we’d say its personality is in the middle of those two — slightly less sporty than an Accord and the slightest bit less comfortable than a Camry. We see this as more of an asset than a fault, similar to the way Audi splits the difference between BMW and Mercedes among luxury cars.
Our seat time was in Sonata models with the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder turbo engine, which comes in SEL Plus and Limited models. This engine has less horsepower than the standard 2.5-liter, but more torque. This leads to smooth and confident acceleration from a stop, and enough in reserve for good if not great passing power. All models use an 8-speed automatic transmission that is seamless. The cabin is acceptably quiet, though we did notice modest wind noise from the driver-side door at elevated highway speeds.
One of the Sonata’s best driving features is its ability to take on much of the task itself. The Highway Drive Assist — standard in Limited models and optional in the SEL Plus — is among the better semi-autonomous systems. Returning to California from Arizona, we basically let the Sonata do most of the driving while keeping our hands on the wheel. Its adaptive cruise control paced the vehicle in front, and its lane-centering system kept the new Sonata centered and sure. It also worked well in stop-and-go traffic, though initially activating the Smart Cruise Control took a couple of tries.
We also spent some time in a 2020 Sonata Hybrid, a top-of-the-line Limited model. Our quick take: It feels much like a standard Sonata Limited that gets phenomenal fuel economy.
If you’re used to the smooth power delivery of a Prius or any other hybrid with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), the silky shifts of the Sonata Hybrid’s standard automatic make this Hyundai feel more like a car with a conventional drivetrain. The Sonata Hybrid Limited also has a 205-watt Solar Panel roof that charges the car’s 12-volt and hybrid lithium-ion batteries. Besides looking techy, the Solar Roof gives the new Sonata Hybrid a couple of extra miles of range per day, or about 700 “free” miles over the course of a year. Pretty nifty.
RELATED: Best Midsize Cars of 2020
Interior ComfortThe Sonata’s 5-passenger cabin has an open and contemporary design. The driver’s spot is a nice place to be, and we found the seat comfortable even after hours behind the wheel. Part of the Sonata’s airy feel can be attributed to its transmission selector, or lack thereof. Instead of a traditional lever, there are buttons. This setup takes some getting used to, but we did and think it is among the better executed of such layouts.
In the center of the dash is the infotainment screen — a commendable eight inches as standard or a large and crisp 10.25-inch version that’s optional on SEL Plus and standard on Limited models. Controls to adjust common functions like volume and climate are easy to see and use, though we wish there were also a dial for radio tuning and track selection.
On paper the Sonata’s rear-seat legroom pales to the Accord’s — 34.8 inches vs. 40.4 — but in reality still feels accommodating for adults. Furthermore, the Hyundai gives back that room up front, with 46.1 inches for driver and passenger vs. the Accord’s 42.3.
Exterior StylingWell, what do you think? Just look at that sinister, sultry front end, those LED running lights that extend up the hood and meet at a chrome strip that runs the rest of the way up the sides. Hyundai’s design executive said the team aimed for “sensuous sportiness” with this all-new Sonata. In a way it’s also a return to form and daring design, similar to the 6th-gen version that made waves back in 2011.
The front end will certainly be loved or loathed, but we think other elements of the new Sonata will be generally liked. Its side profile, like so many other sedans these days, strives to be a coupe, while its rear is nice and tucked with an almost-fastback profile.
Pro tip for spotters: Base Sonatas have a single, hidden tailpipe and grille with brightwork, while all other models have a gloss-black grille and twin-tip exhaust outlets.
Note: The new 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is distinguished by a revised grille, unique wheels and a rear spoiler that helps lower the coefficient of drag to an impressive 0.24. Also, the Solar Roof on the Hybrid Limited model is a design element unto itself.
Favorite FeaturesHYUNDAI DIGITAL KEY
No key? No problem. This feature — standard on all but base SE trims — turns your phone into a key, and also allows you to grant access to the Sonata for friends and family via their phone. At present it only works for the Android operating system, but also included is a hotel-like key card that also allows entry and activation.
BLIND-VIEW MONITOR
This class-exclusive feature, standard on Limited models, takes blind-spot monitoring to a whole new level. When you activate the turn signal, a real-time image of the left or right lane is displayed directly in front of you in the all-digital instrument cluster.
Standard FeaturesThe 2020 Hyundai Sonata lineup is refreshingly simple, spanning these four trims: SE, SEL, SEL Plus and Limited. At its most basic, a Sonata SE includes the standard tech you want such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, plus 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat and LED headlights and taillights.
Also standard is a full suite of active safety and driver-assist features, including lane-keeping assist, forward-collision alert with automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go. As with all new Hyundais, the Sonata has a class-leading warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain.
Factory OptionsWhile the SE is solid, we’d recommend stepping up to at least an SEL trim. For $2,100 more, it adds blind-spot monitoring with collision-avoidance assist, heated front seats, 8-way-power driver’s seat, heated side mirrors, rear-seat armrest with cup holders, enhanced infotainment system with satellite radio and Blue Link remote vehicle access, dual-zone climate control, and proximity key with push-button start.
From there, the SEL Plus trim includes the turbo engine, fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster, the Digital Key (see Favorite Features), suede/Leatherette upholstery, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, rear-seat air vents (optional on SEL trims), auto-dimming rearview mirror, wireless phone charger, and body-color/satin-chrome door handles.
At the top, Sonata Limited models include the Blind View Monitor, leather interior, panoramic sunroof, head-up display, power-adjust passenger seat, surround-view rearview camera, ventilated front seats and heated steering wheel, 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, and 12-speaker Bose audio system. A seriously slick feature found in the Limited model is Remote Smart Parking Assist, which lets you drive the Sonata in and out of tight spaces while standing outside the vehicle. Using the key fob, it’s like the world’s biggest RC car.
Engine & TransmissionFor its debut year, the 8th-generation Hyundai Sonata offers a choice of two engines. SE and SEL models use a new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that makes 191 horsepower, while SEL Plus and Limited models come with a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 180 horsepower. While the higher-trim turbo engine has less horsepower, it offers more torque — 195 lb-ft compared to 181 lb-ft — which enables better off-the-line acceleration. All 2020 Sonatas are front-wheel drive and use an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission.
The new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is the one exception. It uses a 6-speed automatic transmission (with paddle shifters) that mates to a hybrid powertrain featuring a 2.0-liter gasoline engine and a 51-horsepower electric motor. Combined output is 192 horsepower.
The upcoming N Line Sonata will use a turbocharged version of the 2.5-liter engine that makes an estimated 290 horsepower.

2020 Hyundai Sonata is all-new
Marks eighth generation of Hyundai’s midsize sedan
Debuts with choice of two engines
Sonata Hybrid available in June

#2 in Best Midsize Cars of 2020
The Hyundai Sonata is all-new for 2020, marking the eighth generation of this midsize family sedan. Again in its sights are the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, formidable rivals to be sure. But as we’ve come to expect from Hyundai, it is playing to win. That mindset has manifested in the best Sonata yet, one that brings loads of safety equipment in even its least expensive form, and unexpected technology and amenities in its highest trim. There’s also a 2020 Sonata Hybrid that gets up to 53 mpg on the highway. Furthermore, the goods come at a price that still undercuts competitors.
Part of the 2020 Hyundai Sonata’s revamp is a sleek new exterior design that will surely bring differences of opinion. Let your eyes decide. And if you’re among the few drivers seeking a manual-transmission family sedan, you’ll have to look to the Honda. Those factors aside, the 2020 Hyundai Sonata is a complete package and then some, and still boasts the best warranty in the business.

Driving the  2020 Toyota Avalon HybridThe Avalon has long excelled as a large, comfortable sedan with a ride quality so plush that it bordered on floaty. With last year’s revamp, that is no longer the case. It is still very comfortable and refined, but it has more edge. The Avalon is hardly a sports sedan, but that isn’t its intent.
Even the new Avalon TRD model, with a lower ride height and stiffer suspension, remains at its best as a comfortable cruiser. But for those times when you want a zippier experience, the Avalon won’t protest unduly if thrown into a corner.
This is mostly the case with the TRD and Touring models, the latter of which has an adaptive suspension system. The standard V6 provides plenty of oomph, and the 8-speed automatic transmission does its work smoothly and precisely behind the scenes. Close your eyes (well, not literally) and you might think you’re in a Lexus.
If you prioritize fuel economy, the Avalon Hybrid delivers. It uses a 4-cylinder engine and battery-electric powertrain. No plugging in is required; it functions just as a traditional vehicle. The Avalon Hybrid has less power than the V6 and subsequently feels a bit slower, but not laggardly. The upside is fuel economy over 40 mpg. That is very impressive for a full-size sedan.
Interior ComfortThe Avalon is at once roomy and refined, tech-forward yet still simple enough to use even by seasoned drivers. All models feature a prominent 9-inch touch-screen display with redundant physical controls. We also like that the Avalon has a traditional gearshift rather than buttons, dials or some other method deemed futuristic. Roominess remains a core asset of the Avalon, and a big reason buyers prefer Toyota’s flagship sedan to its Camry sibling.
Rear-seat legroom is impressive even for taller passengers, and the front seats are supple enough to make long treks feel shorter than they are. Even lower trims of the Avalon boast above-average fit and finish, while top-line trims with features like quilted leather paneling could pass for a vehicle by Toyota’s luxury brand, Lexus. At over 16 cubic feet, the trunk is spacious, and fold-down rear seats add to the practicality. The new Avalon TRD model stands out with TRD-embroidered headrests, red stitching and assertive red seatbelts.
Exterior StylingFor its all-new generation that debuted last year, Toyota brought the sexy out for its Avalon sedan. Its more aggressive look is clearly an attempt to draw in younger buyers not interested in SUVs or wagons. From its massive wide-mouth grille to its distinctive character lines, the Avalon is all about impressing. There’s plenty of glass for good visibility, and the four corners are high enough to easily figure out where the car is, regardless of the driver’s position and seat height.
For those seeking an even sportier and more aggressive tone, the limited-edition 2020 Avalon TRD sits 0.6 inch lower, has an aero body kit and notable front splitter like a sports car, and wears 19-inch matte-black alloy wheels and a trunk-mounted spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE PLUS (TSS-P)
Like many new Toyotas, the 2020 Avalon boasts an impressive suite of active safety and driver-assistance features at no extra cost. The TSS-P system includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert, full-speed radar cruise control and more.
TOURING TRIM
The Touring trim is an overall excellent choice. You’ll still get the comfortable ride and feature-rich content of the Limited and XSE trims, but with more in the way of performance and driving enjoyment. If you can live without the Limited’s genuine leather seating, the Touring is the way to go.
Standard FeaturesToyota’s Avalon comes in five main trims, but even the least expensive has a good roster of standard equipment and is easy to recommend. The base 2020 Avalon XLE includes heated and 8-way power-adjustable fronts seats, SofTex faux leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control with rear-seat air vents, keyless entry with push-button start, auto-dimming rearview mirror, four USB charge ports, and a 301-horsepower V6 engine.
Standard infotainment features a 9-inch touch screen with Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa integration (but no Android Auto yet), eight speakers and a 3-year trial of the Safety Connect system with features like an emergency-assistance button.
All 2020 Avalons feature extensive safety systems including forward-collision alert with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure/lane-keeping assist, automatic high beams, radar cruise control and blind-spot monitoring. All Avalon models also come with two years or 25,000 miles of no-cost maintenance and roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsMost major options come by climbing trims and include leather interior, heated rear seats and ventilated front seats, 10-inch color head-up display, universal garage remote, premium JBL audio system with navigation, moonroof, surround-view rearview camera, parking sensors and the ability to stop the vehicle if a rear collision is anticipated from cross traffic while backing up.
The Avalon Touring model has a special Sport+ driving mode in addition to the standard Eco/Normal/Sport settings, plus adaptive suspension. The Avalon XSE has a stiffer, sport-tuned suspension, while the new Avalon TRD model goes even further with a track-tuned suspension, larger front brakes, lower ride height and aerodynamic enhancements.
The Avalon hybrid trims largely mirror their gasoline counterparts and come in XLE, XSE and Limited trims.
Engine & TransmissionWith the Toyota Avalon, you can have a powerful car with good fuel economy, or really impressive fuel economy with good power. The standard Avalon comes with a 301-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission.
The hybrid employs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with two electric-motor generators and a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Combined output is 215 horsepower, and combined fuel economy is up to 44 mpg.
The Toyota Avalon TRD has the standard V6 with no bump in power, but a performance exhaust and sportier suspension.
All 2020 Avalon models are front-wheel drive, and all run fine on regular 87-octane unleaded gasoline.

Top 10 Features of the 2020 Toyota Avalon
#1. Lexus-like refinement at Toyota prices
Lexus is Toyota’s luxury vehicle division, but this is where the two overlap. And the 2020 Avalon is a few thousand dollars less than a similar ES.
#2. Expansive rear passenger space
Rear legroom in the 2020 Avalon measures a generous 40.3 inches. And the rear seat is wide enough to take three adults instead of the usual two and a bit.
#3. Hushed cabin
Every 2020 Avalon has acoustic glass for the windshield and side windows.
#4. Toyota Safety Sense P
Fitted to every 2020 Avalon, this array of driver aids includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control and active lane-keeping. Blind-spot monitoring is also standard.
#5. Perfect crash test scores
It’s a full five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a “Top Safety Pick Plus” accolade from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) for the top two trims because of their superior headlights.
#6. Hybrid variant available
Those making low emissions a high priority will be just as comforted by the Avalon Hybrid XLE’s average of 44 mpg as they will by the extremely plush seating.
#7. Sweet V6
Toyota has plenty of hybrid expertise, but also makes a 301-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 that’s so refined and dependable it would impress a Swiss watchmaker. It’s the standard engine in the Avalon.
#8. Adaptive suspension
Available in Touring trim. An adaptive suspension — a setup that adjusts its settings within milliseconds according to the road and driver inputs — is the sort of feature more commonly found in premium marques like Mercedes-Benz.
#9. Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa
Every 2020 Avalon comes with these tech additions. Apple CarPlay integrates iPhones; Alexa allows users to lock/unlock doors and check fuel levels by speaking to an Alexa-enabled device.
#10. Resale values
The Avalon is expected to retain its worth much better than rivals like the Nissan Maxima, Kia Cadenza and Chrysler 300.
 
Overview
The 2020 Avalon is Toyota’s flagship sedan, the big brother to the Camry. This full-size sedan has comfortable ride manners, a roomy interior, standard V6 engine, and a strong history of reliability. Totally revamped just last year, the Avalon stays fresh with handsome design, technology including Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa integration, and Toyota’s robust suite of active safety features.
New for 2020 is a sportier TRD edition from Toyota’s performance division, while on the other end of the spectrum is a hybrid Avalon that earns up to 44 mpg. Perhaps just as noteworthy is the Avalon’s continued existence and updating. Former rivals such as the Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse have been axed as sales of full-size sedans lose favor.
But for traditionalists or road warriors seeking a big, comfortable sedan that easily eats up miles, the 2020 Toyota Avalon is our pick. About the only thing it lacks vs. competitors is the optional V8 and all-wheel drive of rivals like the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Challenger, or the lower starting price of the Kia Cadenza.

Driving the  2020 Toyota 4RunnerA relatively unsophisticated ride quality brings bearable manners on smooth roads and some cushioning over rougher surfaces, but the 2020 4Runner will lean noticeably if a corner is taken with anything like gusto. In general, this body-on-frame setup results in truck-like rather than car-like ride and handling.
However, the 270-horsepower V6 is a superb engine, with plenty of muscle for passing, towing and getting up to freeway speeds. Fuel economy, on the other hand, is not its best feature. The 4Runner’s weight and having only five forward gears in its automatic transmission have their impact on this situation. And we’ve found the brake pedal can be tricky to modulate. On challenging terrain, the 4Runner excels, thanks to a fairly narrow body and potential 9.6 inches of ground clearance (with the dedicated off-road suspension).
Interior ComfortThe cabin layout in the 2020 4Runner is simple but effective. Buttons and dials are large and easy to use, even when selecting the low-range gearing. The center console has the option of a 120-volt outlet and now includes an 8-inch touch screen for the multimedia system that has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for the first time. It also sports a new instrument panel that’s more easily visible.
The power-adjustable front seats are comfortable and supportive, fine for longer trips, while the reclining 2nd-row seats split and fold in a 40/20/40 configuration for some passenger/cargo versatility. Folding them flat opens up a load area of almost 90 cubic feet. The SR5 and Limited trim levels offer a 3rd-row seat, but that’s more kid-friendly than adult-sized, especially now that they’ve included two USB ports in the second row.
Exterior StylingOf all the trim levels available with the 2020 4Runner, the all-wheel-drive TRD Pro looks the most rugged, with a hood scoop, skidplates, chunky tires and raised suspension. Every version has a roof rack as standard.
The overall design is essentially a “2-box” approach enlivened somewhat by flared fenders. The front overhang is relatively short, which is good news for off-roaders. Even the base SR5 however, retains unique good looks among a sea of indecipherable mall crawlers.
The one reason Toyota’s been able to get away with not redesigning this SUV in over 10 years is that it did such a good job the last time.
Favorite FeaturesTOYOTA SAFETY SENSEToyota finally gets the 4Runner up to speed in the safety department by including its suite of safety features.
SMARTPHONE CONNECTIVITYThe 4Runner finally meets the future by integrating a larger 8-inch touch screen into the center stack and providing Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa compatibility to the infotainment equation.
Standard FeaturesApple CarPlay, Android Auto and Toyota Safety sense are huge wins when it comes to new standard features in the 4Runner across all trims that include the SR5/SR5 Premium, Limited, and TRD Off-Road/Off-Road Premium/Pro trim levels. The basic SR5 has an 8-inch touch screen, Entune Audio Plus with the Connected Navigation app and Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth music streaming, and an 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat.
The TRD models deploy all-wheel drive (the default is rear-wheel drive), add water-resistant seat fabric, locking rear differential, and multi-terrain selection with crawl control. TRD Pro receives a 15-speaker JBL sound system, navigation and the Fox suspension. Limited models have 20-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, leather-trimmed seats (heated/ventilated in front), moonroof, and an X-REAS (cross-linked relative absorber system) suspension for better body control.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is optional in the SR5 and Limited versions, standard in the TRD models. Other extras include the 3rd-row seat and a handy sliding cargo deck, while the off-road specialist TRD versions are also available with the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) that can disconnect the stabilizer bars to allow more axle travel and therefore help conquer tougher terrain. Other extras such as running boards, sliding rear cargo deck with under-floor storage and moonroof with sliding shades are offered as options on lower-trim levels.
Engine & TransmissionToyota’s midsize SUV is motivated by a strong 4.0-liter V6 generating 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is standard in the SR5 and Limited versions. A part-time all-wheel-drive (AWD) system is fitted to the TRD models, while a full-time AWD setup with a limited-slip locking center differential is offered in the Limited. In all cases, the transmission is a 5-speed automatic; AWD versions have low-range gearing. The 2020 4Runner is rated to tow 5,000 pounds. It’s okay to use regular gasoline, but fuel consumption is relatively poor, with all versions achieving an average of 18 mpg.

As crossover SUVs become ever more popular, the 2020 Toyota 4Runner SUV looks increasingly like a different breed. It isn’t based on a car platform but uses a body-on-frame construction, putting it in that category known as “old school.” But hey, Harvard is an old school. These places have their advantages.
The 4Runner midsize SUV is tough and remarkably capable when tarmac gives way to tougher terrain. Ford Explorer? Nissan Pathfinder? These are just nice names compared with the 4Runner’s affinity for the wild. It also enjoys Toyota’s virtually bombproof reliability. Now with Toyota Safety Sense and a larger 8-inch touch screen the 4Runner gets closer to the competition in the tech department.

Driving the  2020 Hyundai ElantraOverall, the Hyundai Elantra sedan leans more toward comfortable and controlled than involving and lively. The electrically assisted steering does its job efficiently, but not with any particular feel. The base 147-horsepower engine at least has some zest, while the brakes feel confident. The Eco model’s engine is a turbocharged 1.4-liter unit that balances a useful 128 horsepower with an average of 36 mpg. For more power, the Elantra GT hatchback brings 161 horses, while the Sport sedan model and the GT N Line enjoy 201. Incidentally, the Sport sedan and the GT N Line have a more sophisticated rear suspension, enhancing the cars’ agility.
Interior ComfortClever packaging means the Hyundai Elantra compact sedan has passenger space on a par with midsize sedans: 96 cubic feet. The GT hatchback is roomier by one cubic foot. Hyundai isn’t the only smart car company, of course. The Honda Civic sedan offers 98 cubic feet. The overall picture, though, is rosy for buyers who would like something bigger than the typical compact car, but don’t have the necessary funds. While lounging in the spacious cabin of the Elantra, we can appreciate the physical controls for things like the climate and audio systems, as opposed to scrolling through a bunch of sub-menus on a touch screen.
Exterior StylingIt might be tough to distinguish the 2020 Elantra sedan from its larger Sonata stablemate, but that’s not exactly a bad thing. The company’s current design approach is arguably easy on most people’s eyes, perhaps with an Audi-esque undertone to the front. The higher trims have LED headlights. Buyers should also find an alloy wheel design that works for them. Despite the roomy interior, the Elantra remains more than manageable at 15 feet long. About nine feet of that is the wheelbase, which is relatively expansive. Short wheelbases restrict legroom and contribute to a jiggly ride quality.
Favorite FeaturesPOWER TRUNK WITH A TRICK
This is so much smarter than having to do a one-footed dance under the rear bumper. Just stand at the rear of the Elantra sedan with the key fob somewhere near (like in a pocket or a purse) and the power-operated trunk lid will open after a few seconds.
QI WIRELESS CHARGING
Although we wish it were standard in every car, the 2020 Elantra in second-from-top Limited trim comes with a Qi charging pad, which is so much tidier and more convenient than fiddling with cables.
Standard FeaturesNow with dual-zone automatic climate control, an automatic transmission, forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance and driver-attention monitoring, the entry-level 2020 Elantra SE expands its inventory of standard equipment. The other features are general rather than generous, including a 5-inch infotainment display, selectable driving modes and 15-inch steel wheels. The SEL has a 7-inch touch screen, plus 16-inch alloy wheels, smartphone integration and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. All new Elantras include Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and a 5-year/60,000-mile standard warranty covering virtually everything else.
Factory OptionsThe higher up the trim levels, the more equipment the 2020 Elantra enjoys. For example, the Value Edition comes with heated front seats, sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, plus remote start and lock/unlock functions. The Limited brings leather upholstery, two USB ports, automatic high beams, a few more luxury touches, an upgraded audio system and eligibility for an options bundle that includes navigation, 8-inch touch screen, adaptive cruise control, and driver’s-side memory settings. The Sport has the most powerful engine, 18-inch alloy wheels, flat-bottomed steering wheel, sport front seats and bigger brakes, plus the option of that fancier infotainment system.
Engine & TransmissionPowering the 2020 Elantra SE, SEL, Value Edition and Limited variants is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder unit. This is linked to the new-for-2020 Intelligent Variable Transmission. The Eco version has a turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with a stop/start function and is paired to a 7-speed automated transmission. This same transmission is also in the Sport and GT N Line models, but these are propelled by a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. All versions are front-wheel drive and all run on regular gasoline, even the turbocharged engines.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2020 Elantra sedan gains an upgraded continuously variable transmission (CVT), that Hyundai calls an Intelligent Variable Transmission. The result is that average fuel consumption improves by two or three miles per gallon, depending on model. Standard safety equipment now includes forward-collision mitigation with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance and driver-attention monitoring. The Eco model has an engine stop/start function. And dual-zone automatic climate control becomes part of the package.
#4 in Best Small Cars of 2020
There’s no dispute, the 2020 Hyundai Elantra is really impressive. After a substantial makeover last year, Hyundai has made even more improvements this year. The bigger takeaway from these developments is that the compact-sedan scene is alive, well and thriving. Otherwise why would major manufacturers make such an effort? The Elantra competes with superb cars like the Honda Civic and Mazda3. It does so by emphasizing luxury and safety aspects, generous standard equipment, styling influenced by upscale cars, plus an unbeatable 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. For those seeking something sporty, there’s the hatchback Elantra GT N Line (taking over from the GT Sport).

Also, while this BMW has new, modern tech features, you’ll find better, more intuitive amenities in other full-size luxury sedans.",86450,"The Audi A8 starts at about $85,000, and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan starts at about $93,000 and climbs to about $230,000. Meanwhile, the Lexus LS is the value leader, starting at $76,475 while consistently offering strong resale values. While pricing is comparable to that of its competitors, other cars in this segment offer more advanced technology and luxury for the money.
Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what folks in your area are paying for the new 7 Series.
Driving the  2020 BMW 7 SeriesWe drove two European-spec variants of the 2020 BMW 7 Series, the 750i xDrive and the 745e xDrive plug-in hybrid. Though BMW defines itself as being the sports-sedan marque, there’s only so much sportiness a heavy, full-size car can offer. Also, the suspension of the 7 Series is biased toward comfort, and 2-axle air suspension comes standard.
On cobblestone surfaces, the supple suspension gave the 750i xDrive a smooth, compliant ride. On country roads and on highways, acceleration was very good, and there was never a want for more power. The 7 Series’ adaptive suspension allows you to maximize the sportiness of this sedan, and while it does still have some performance chops, the 7 Series is most at home in Comfort mode. The defeatable automatic start/stop wasn’t a distraction, and the interior is pleasantly quiet.
We briefly drove the 745e plug-in hybrid, which was also quiet and smooth. You can choose among Sport, Hybrid, Electric, Adaptive, and Individual modes, and you can reserve your 36 miles of all-electric range for around-town driving. The 745e PHEV drives much like a regular 7 Series, and while 36 miles doesn’t seem like much of an enticement for the additional cost, consider the added benefit of extended overall range when you drive the car as a hybrid.
This is a comfortable, spacious full-size luxury sedan that would be a pleasure to drive on long roads and offers an effortless way to cover hundreds of miles at a stretch.
Interior ComfortThe 2020 BMW 7 Series has put a stronger emphasis on digital interfaces, starting with the fully digital instrument cluster that’s embedded in a 12.3-inch screen. There’s a 10.25-inch control display at the top of the dashboard that serves as the hub for music, navigation and communications functions, and the iDrive controller uses a touch pad to help you navigate through it all.
An Intelligent Personal Assistant can help you find local restaurants and more, and software and navigation upgrades can be done remotely, over the air. Other modern touches: a wireless charging pad for smartphones, and Apple CarPlay.
Lux features include quad-zone climate control, heated and ventilated seats, and available Bowers & Wilkins Diamond 3D Surround Sound audio, and quilted Nappa leather, a 7 Series exclusive. Rear-seat passengers can use 10-inch HD screens and a Blu-ray player. An available remote lets passengers control their power-adjustable seats, choose massage functions, and adjust heated seats and ambient temperature.
Exterior StylingThe bolder, more aggressive profile was something global buyers wanted, and for 2020, BMW delivered.
For the new 7 Series, BMW expanded its trademark twin-kidney grille to giant proportions, making it 40 percent larger than it was in 2019. That change makes the front end more imposing, with a taller front profile with more chrome, and the grille sits at a flat, 90-degree angle to the rest of the car.
There are new design elements along the sides and rear of the 2020 BMW 7 Series as well: better defined contour lines on the hood and character lines along the body sides, and vented wings along the sides behind the front wheels. Slimmer, sleeker 3-dimensional LED headlights tie in nicely with the narrow 3D LED taillights, and there are redesigned chrome surrounds for the exhaust tips. The 2020 BMW 7 Series rides on new light-alloy wheels.
Favorite FeaturesLUXURY REAR-SEATING PACKAGE
Buyers of the 2020 BMW 7 Series can envelop rear-seat passengers in opulent luxury. This package comes with power-adjustable rear heated seats and armrests, with three levels of heat, plus eight types of massage. The rear seats are also ventilated. Want to go beyond luxury? The Rear Executive Lounge Seating Package adds a power footrest, rear-seat entertainment, and a 7-inch touch-screen controller.
PLUG-IN HYBRID POWERTRAIN
For 2020, the BMW 745e plug-in hybrid uses a new engine compared to last year’s PHEV model, plus a 12.0-kWh lithium battery that creates more all-electric range. These work together to make the car both more efficient and faster. You can even save the electric power for when you want it, such as driving around town.
Standard FeaturesThe most affordable 7 Series is the 740i, which comes with rear-wheel drive and is powered by a turbocharged inline-6 engine controlled by an 8-speed automatic transmission. Auto start/stop comes standard, as do brake-energy regeneration and driving dynamics control with driving modes. The sedan rides on 18-inch wheels. All 7 Series come with dynamic damper control and a self-leveling air suspension.
Inside, the new 7 Series comes with leather 20-way-power front seats with 4-way lumbar support and driver- and passenger-seat memory settings. Memory settings also include power mirror, audio and climate-control settings. A heated steering wheel is standard. You get a 600-watt, 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system, with Apple CarPlay. Android Auto compatibility is not yet offered. But Qi wireless charging does come standard, as do two USB ports.
Factory OptionsYou can step up to other engines, including V12 power, and all-wheel drive comes on all but the 740i. You can opt for quilted Nappa leather and a variety of wood trim choices. The Driving Assistance Professional Package adds adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, active lane-keeping assist with side-collision avoidance and automatic lane change. The package also has evasion assistant and cross-traffic alert, as well as steering and traffic-jam assistant.
The Autobahn Package offers active comfort drive with road preview, active roll stabilization, and includes rear-wheel steering. Other extras include power-adjustable rear heated/ventilated seats and armrests, plus eight types of massage, a power footrest, rear-seat entertainment, a 7-inch touch-screen remote, and a 1,400-watt, 16-speaker Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound system.

The Rear Executive Lounge Seating Package adds a power footrest, and rear-seat entertainment with a 7-inch touch-screen control.
Engine & TransmissionThe entry point for the 2020 BMW 7 Series is the rear-drive 740i, powered by a turbocharged inline 6-cylinder engine producing 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. It’s the only 7 Series that comes with rear drive (RWD). Add all-wheel drive (AWD), and you have the 740i xDrive. The 750i xDrive, likely to be the volume seller, has a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine producing 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Then there’s the M760i xDrive, with a V12 engine making 600 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque.
If fuel efficiency is what you seek, consider the 745e xDrive plug-in hybrid. Total system output of the 280-horsepower, turbo inline-6 and 113-horsepower electric motor is 389 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. The plug-in hybrid has more power and a higher range when driving in all-electric mode than in the outgoing model, and the 745e xDrive uses a 12.0-kWh lithium-ion battery, which is stored under the rear seats to free up more cargo space in the trunk. All engines are backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission.

Every powertrain benefits from more power, and the plug-in hybrid variant has both more power and more electric-only range.
One look at the significantly refreshed 2020 BMW 7 Series, and you can’t miss what sets it apart from the rest of the full-size luxury cars out there: a dominant upright grille, which is considerably larger than on the previous model. But there’s more to this BMW flagship sedan than polarizing new looks. It also benefits from an expanded roster of luxury and convenience amenities, which makes it more competitive in a posh, highly technologically savvy segment.
Each rival has its own personality: While the Audi A8 specializes in advanced technology, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class is arguably the most luxurious car in the segment, and the Lexus LS brings fine craftsmanship and reliability, the BMW aims to provide a balance between luxury and sportiness.

Which Model is Right for Me? 2020 BMW M4 Coupe
425-horsepower twin-turbo 6-cylinder
Leather interior
14-way front seats
Dual-zone climate control
8.8-inch touchscreen w/ Apple CarPlay
2020 BMW M4 Convertible
All features on the coupe, plus:
Retractable hardtop roof
Driving the  2020 BMW M4The BMW M4 really is the 4 Series taken to another level. Whereas BWM’s standard 4 Series coupe and convertible are quick yet compliant, the M4 is menacing and moody. It does 0-60 mph in as little as 3.9 seconds, and you can shave that time if you’re lucky enough to score one of the more powerful, limited-edition M4 CS models.
The M4’s suspension is also tighter than that of the standard model, which enables it to stick to pavement, but alternately means a harsher ride quality in everyday commutes.
The M4 is only available in rear-wheel drive, so know what you’re getting into if you regularly deal with slick roads. If that’s the case, the all-wheel-drive Audi RS 5 might be a better choice. That high-performance luxury coupe, along with the rear-drive Mercedes-AMG C 63 S Coupe, can also boast of 0-60-mph times of just 3.7 seconds.
Unlike its rivals, though, the BMW M4 still offers a manual transmission. The standard 6-speed manual offers rev-matched downshifts and is the real choice for drivers seeking the most engagement. We also simply prefer it to the optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic that isn’t as refined as the competitors’ automatics.
Interior ComfortBoth the M4 Coupe and M4 Convertible have seating for four passengers, though it’s no surprise that the rear seats are snug. Up front, this current M4 is still based on an older BMW design. That means you won’t get the slick all-digital instrument cluster available in the latest 3 Series or that model’s latest tech.
But this BMW is hardly a dinosaur. There’s a standard 8.8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay integration, leather upholstery, and 14-way-power front seats. The steering wheel is thick and feels great. Controls and buttons to adjust audio and climate controls are easy to use and see. On a practical side, the M4 coupe has split-folding rear seats, while the M4 convertible has a pass-through for longer objects like skis.
Exterior StylingThe M4 coupe and convertible have similar designs as the standard 4 Series, but the M editions’ traits are easy to see if you know where to look. The hood features a power dome that you can think of as a bicep signaling this performance car’s extra muscle. In back are quad exhaust outlets.
While the M4’s wheelbase is nearly identical to the standard 4 Series, this beefed-up model has a wider track and overall stance. The M4 convertible has a metal roof that retracts, while the M4 coupe’s fixed roof is carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, part of a weight-saving effort. Both models come with 18-inch wheels and high-performance non-run-flat tires.
Favorite FeaturesHARDTOP CONVERTIBLE
Yes, the hardtop adds weight to the M4, but we still think it’s an acceptable trade-off for having two cars in one: a coupe with a metal roof that offers sturdiness and safety, and an open-air cruiser for when the weather is nice. It’s also a differentiator between the M4’s Mercedes rival that uses a fabric top.
MANUAL TRANSMISSION
Even among BMWs, the M4 is among the rarity still offering a manual transmission. The automaker also hasn’t indicated if the next-gen M3 and M4 will offer one. All that to say, if you still want a new M4 with a manual, you may want to act sooner vs. later.
Standard FeaturesAside from its track-ready performance and extra power, the BMW M4 remains a luxury-sports coupe and convertible with a nice roster of premium features. Standard highlights include leather interior with carbon-fiber trim, 14-way-adjustable front seats with 3-stage heating, dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, auto-dimming rearview and side mirrors, hands-free trunk opening, universal garage remote, and power-folding and heated mirrors.
The standard infotainment system bundles an 8.8-inch touchscreen with navigation, 16-speaker Harman Kardon AM/FM/CD audio with HD Radio, SiriusXM, and 20-gig hard drive along with USB input and Bluetooth. With this BMW, you get Apple CarPlay compatibility, but not Android Auto.
Standard safety systems include lane-departure warning, frontal-collision warning with pedestrian detection, and lower-speed automatic emergency braking. The M4 for 2020 also gets three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.
Factory OptionsThe Executive Package bundles a head-up display, surround-view camera system, automatic high-beam control, adaptive LED headlights, and an aid to help steer you into a parallel-parking space.
The Competition Package boosts horsepower to 444, brings 20-inch wheels, a sport exhaust, and tweaks aspects of the M4’s steering, differential, and stability control for higher performance.
Individual options include blind-spot monitoring, moonroof for the coupe and neck warmer for the convertible, heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging and Wi-Fi hotspot, and carbon-ceramic brakes for a cool $8,150. The 7-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission is $2,900.
A good investment — and a good time — is the M Driver’s Package that gives you a day of driver training at one of BMW’s performance centers in California or South Carolina. The package also lifts the BWM M4’s top speed from 155 mph to 174 mph.
Engine & TransmissionThe BMW M4 uses a twin-turbo inline 6-cylinder that makes 425 horsepower, or 444 if you get the Competition Package. That’s a lot of power, but still less than the Mercedes-AMG C 63, which makes 469 horsepower in standard form and 503 horsepower in the S variant.
The BMW M4’s standard 6-speed manual is a joy to use and our preference, but many buyers will go for the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Rear-wheel drive is the only drivetrain offered. Like other new cars, the BMW M4 uses an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. Restarts can be rough, but there’s a button to disable the system.

Read Full Review","What's New?
No significant changes compared to 2019 model

Available as a coupe or hardtop convertible, the 2020 BMW M4 is the high-performance variant of the standard 4 Series. Like its luxury 2-door siblings, the M4 has premium appointments, a handsome design, and seating for four passengers.
The differentiator is muscle. Under the 2020 M4’s bulging hood is a twin-turbocharged inline 6-cylinder that makes 425 horsepower (or 444 with the Competition Package). In addition to its extra power, the M4 has track-ready hardware to help it corner better, brake harder, and be all-around faster.
Though this model is still a potent contender, an all-new BMW M4 is likely around the corner. While this current edition isn’t as technologically sophisticated as rivals like the Mercedes-AMG C 63 or Audi RS 5, the 2020 M4 remains a force to be reckoned with. And among its handful of rivals, it’s the only one left still offering a manual transmission.

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm.

April 15, 1912 was a bad day to be in steerage. Sometimes traveling first class pays serious dividends, like getting a seat on one of the few Titanic lifeboats. Yep, that was the day Captain “I’ll Be in My Cabin Snoozing” managed to run his unsinkable ship into an iceberg. Ahoy. For you, on the other hand, April could go down as a great month, particularly if you are on the hunt for a certified pre-owned 2019 Sierra 1500 truck. GMC isn’t making any financing offers on its CPO Sierra 1500s this month, but why not check them out anyway?
Being a CPO GMC vehicle means having passed a rigid inspection by a trained technician. GMC then provides these best-of-the-best GMC used trucks and SUVs with additional warranty protection. GMC further sweetens the pot with a few extra benefits like two free scheduled-maintenance visits and 24-hour roadside assistance.
The best deals in brief

CPO Sierras are the best of the best GMC Sierra models available, having passed a rigid inspection. They also come with extra warranties and several other added-value benefits.

Driving the Used 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabOur first drive of the 2019 GMC Sierra was in the Sierra Denali Crew Cab. Our truck was fitted with the excellent 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8, which is the top-of-the-line engine available in the new Sierra. This big V8 has a low, healthy growl, and power off the line is smooth and quick. The engine uses Dynamic Fuel Management to control cylinder operation, but we could never tell when it was working — it felt seamless. The new 10-speed automatic offers quick response when you accelerate, and power delivery is easy and rewarding. Shifts are smooth, not jumpy, and can be quickened when you choose the sport drive mode. Ride quality is excellent, and braking is nicely predictable and linear. When the previous Sierra was introduced, it boasted arguably the quietest interior in the segment. The new Sierra’s cabin is even quieter. Even though the interior doesn’t have the same pizzazz as that of the new Ram, controls are nicely placed and easy to use, and color choices are clean and tasteful. Another pleasant feature is that the GMC Sierra is spacious, and even the middle rear-seat passenger benefits from a flat floor.
Interior ComfortSharp and upscale, the GMC Sierra’s interior is classy and has a good amount of soft-touch surfaces, but doesn’t raise the bar in design. The cabin is wonderfully roomy and whisper quiet, and the head-up display is large and easy to read. Seats are comfortable, and if you get the 5-passenger Sierra, there is a good amount of storage in the center cargo area. There are also clever side-hinged storage areas in the front of the rear passenger seats. While the Sierra now has push-button start for the first time, you can’t get anything but a column shifter and manual tilt/telescoping wheel.
Exterior StylingThe biggest visual difference between the 2019 GMC Sierra and its Chevrolet Silverado kin is the styling, but that isn’t all. GMC has a higher-tech solution to truck bed access with the MultiPro tailgate, which lets you access gear six different ways. One position creates a tailgate step and uses a small bed handle to make it easier to climb up. If the new Sierra is equipped with power retractable steps, a button on the back angles the step closer to the bed. Also offered exclusively in the Sierra is a carbon-fiber bed. The off-road-designed AT4 trim rides higher and has dark exterior accents.
Favorite FeaturesMULTIPRO TAILGATE
The 2019 GMC Sierra is the only place you can get this innovative tailgate, which can be reconfigured six different ways to make it easier to load, organize and remove gear. It also comes up with a power up/down feature controlled by the key fob.
PROGRADE TRAILERING SYSTEM
From cameras that show you a view of the hitch while connecting a trailer and an extra camera to show you the area behind the trailer when on the road, to trailer-tire-pressure monitoring and a vehicle-specific capability label on the door jamb, the new Sierra has an expansive list of trailer towing features.
Standard FeaturesThe regular Sierra is powered by a 285-horsepower, 4.3-liter V6 with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Inside, there’s a 7-inch screen in the center of the dashboard. Bluetooth, one USB port and power door locks and windows are standard. Cruise control is an option, but every 2019 GMC Sierra comes with the Teen Driver safety suite. Every Sierra also comes with side corner steps in the rear bumper and 12 cargo tiedowns in the bed.
Factory OptionsIf you want the ultimate premium 2019 GMC Sierra, you should get the AT4, which includes a 2-inch suspension lift, skidplates and an off-road-ready wheel-and-tire setup — and you can also get it powered by the topline 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8. Plenty of pleasantries are offered on the Sierra Denali. That mega-list includes: an 8-inch color touch screen, 10-way power driver seat, heated driver/front passenger seats, a rear-camera mirror that shows you what’s behind your truck even when the cab is full, surround view camera system, MultiPro tailgate, power retractable side steps, and wheels up to 20 inches in size. Available safety equipment includes front pedestrian braking, forward-collision alert, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist with lane-departure warning, automatic braking, and lane-change alert with blind-zone alert.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2019 GMC Sierra will be offered with a choice of six engine/transmission combinations, including two different versions of GM’s 5.3-liter V8. For 2019, there are two types of cylinder-management systems to improve fuel economy. Active Fuel Economy is the better-known cylinder shut-off system that has helped boost GM truck mpg. New for 2019 is Dynamic Fuel Management, which is designed to fine-tune the balance between efficiency and power demand. It lets the engine operate anywhere between two and eight cylinders, within 17 different patterns. The new Sierra is initially available with both 5.3-liter V8s, as well as the 6.2-liter. The 4.3-liter V6, 2.7-liter turbo-4, and an upcoming 3.0-liter turbodiesel inline-6 with a 10-speed automatic will follow.

The interior is roomier and has new upscale new options, and GMC has introduced features that make it easier to tow a trailer or carry payload.
All-new from the ground up, the angular, chiseled 2019 GMC Sierra is longer, roomier and lighter than the previous truck, while staying highly capable. Its major changes keep it competitive in a quickly changing group that includes the recently updated Ford F-150 and new-for-2019 Ram 1500 and Chevrolet Silverado. The GMC Sierra is different from the Silverado with which it shares its underpinnings. The biggest differentiators are the GMC’s exterior styling, a more premium interior, and features that are only available on the GMC. The line ranges from basic work truck to the super-luxurious Denali. Maximum payload and towing capacities are very good, and the short bed, the most popular bed length for full-size trucks, is now the largest in the segment.

However, even if you get the top-line Versa SV, you’ll still pay less than $17,000, which is pretty good for a fully loaded new car. By comparison, the Kia Rio has a more powerful engine and a longer warranty, and starts around $15,000; same with the Chevy Sonic, Hyundai Accent and Toyota Yaris. Whatever you decide, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their Versa. Strong resale value is another characteristic of the Versa, where it’s a best-in-class leader.
OK, so what’s next?I’m interested in the newest version of this car. What’s for sale near me?I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.Then again, maybe I should be thinking about a used car.
Driving the Used 2019 Nissan VersaYou wouldn’t be wrong to think a sub-$13,500 car is going to be rough-riding, uncomfortable, underpowered and unsafe, but thankfully this is not the case with the 2019 Nissan Versa sedan. Larger and roomier than a Chevy Sonic, the Versa offers decent handling a cut above that of the Mitsubishi Mirage, but nowhere near as precise as the Honda Fit or Toyota Yaris iA. The Versa imparts a heavy feel, which is nice when surrounded by massive, speeding SUVs, and in this segment, its cabin is relatively quiet. The Versa isn’t going to impress you with rapid off-the-line acceleration, but it moves reasonably quickly, that is until you ask it to perform a high-speed passing maneuver. The tight turning circle makes it easy to park in tight spots, as does the excellent outward visibility. While the 5-speed manual is fun, the CVT (continuously variable automatic transmission) improves both performance and fuel economy.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Nissan Versa sedan has a roomy, nicely detailed and meticulously assembled interior, although its color choices are rather dark and drab. One of the most spacious in the subcompact class, the Versa offers 37 inches of rear-seat legroom, beating the Chevy Sonic by a good three inches. Headroom and hip room are also admirable, as is seat comfort. The instrument cluster and controls are fairly straightforward, easy to see and operate, while a standard 7-inch touch-screen audio system is unexpected at this price, as is air conditioning. The adjustable front driver’s seat and tilt steering wheel make it easy to find a comfortable driving position.
Exterior StylingFrom some angles it’s easy to confuse the 2019 Nissan Versa with the larger and more expensive Nissan Sentra and Altima sedans. The Versa, with its long 102.4-inch wheelbase and 175.4-inch overall length, is big for the subcompact class, and it looks aspirational with its chrome grille surround, our test car’s chrome door handles and its body-color outside mirrors. The Versa’s tall doors make entry and exit easier, and the long rear doors simplify installing a child safety seat. You get nicer-looking alloy wheels on the higher-end SV Special Edition model, as well as fog lights.
Favorite FeaturesGENEROUS REAR-SEAT LEGROOM Thanks to its 102.4-inch wheelbase, the subcompact 2019 Nissan Versa sedan offers more rear-seat legroom than in a Hyundai Accent, Chevy Sonic, Kia Rio or Toyota Yaris iA. Headroom and hip room are also quite good. SV models include a 60/40-folding rear seat allowing expansion of the generous 14.9-cubic-foot trunk.
 APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO There are still some $30,000 sedans out there that don’t offer this feature, but upgrade to the SV Special Edition package, and you’ll enjoy both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Nissan Versa is pretty basic, but it does come with air conditioning, power mirrors, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/aux audio system with 7-inch touch screen and a rearview monitor, tilt steering wheel, trip computer, Bluetooth for your phone, front disc/rear drum brakes, 15-inch steel wheels with covers, vanity mirrors and a rear defroster. It also comes with a 5-speed manual transmission and hand-cranked manual windows. If you want such features as power windows, power door locks, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver’s seat, or even a remote trunk release, you’ll have to step up to a higher trim level.
Factory OptionsClimbing the model ladder is the best way to get more stuff on the 2019 Versa. The mid-level S Plus gets a rear spoiler, cruise control and the CVT automatic. Top-of-the-line SV models gain upgraded seat fabric, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, 6-way-manual driver’s seat, power door locks and keyless entry. The SV Special Edition Package adds 15-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Intelligent Key with push-button start, Sirius XM, Nissan Connect plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Engine & TransmissionThe only engine available in the front-wheel-drive 2019 Nissan Versa sedan is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 109 horsepower. That’s not a lot of power, but the Versa’s not a lot of car, either. Besides, with the CVT automatic transmission it gets an impressive 39 mpg on the highway according to the EPA. If you get the basic Versa S you get a standard 5-speed manual transmission but we suggest skipping it and moving up to the S Plus model with the automatic if you can.
 1.6-liter inline-4 109 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 107 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/36 mpg (5-speed manual), 31/39 mpg (CVT automatic)

Driving the Used 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabWe drove Chevrolet Silverados equipped with the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter V8s. The 5.3-liter has plenty of power, and as the lighter truck with the same power it had last year makes the Silverado plenty spry. Adding to the power delivery is a transmission that now has much quicker response, a notable upgrade from a previous transmission that would suffer from the occasional slow, clunky shift. Another plus: We couldn’t tell when the fuel-management system was working. The 6.2-liter engine has a rumbling exhaust note and is more powerful than the 5.3-liter, but it’s not as dramatic a difference as you would think. It’s a nice option, but unless you need to tow more than the 11,600 pounds you can pull with the 5.3-liter V8, save your money and stick with the 5.3. The truck feels taut and more accurate, with little body roll. Everything from steering to braking feels natural and linear. And the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado drives smaller than it is, with excellent ride quality. The Silverado had already earned a reputation for its quiet cabins, and as far as we can tell, the 2019 model is even quieter.
Latest driving impressions: 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 4-cylinder Turbo
Interior ComfortWhile the Silverado’s interior is tasteful and attractive, it’s still conservative and not a big evolution from last year’s interior. However, the truck’s longer wheelbase translates into a spacious interior, with a flat floor in the crew-cab’s second row. Silverado interiors were already quiet; this one is even quieter. There are clever storage spaces inside, including nooks in the front of the rear seatbacks and spots under the rear seats. But there’s no power tilt/telescoping steering wheel in any trim level, and the largest touch screen you can get is an 8-inch screen. The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado doesn’t come with adaptive cruise control and, while there are a lot of new advanced safety systems, the blind-spot monitor doesn’t account for a vehicle in your trailer’s blind spot.
Exterior StylingChevy’s Silverado is available in eight trim levels, and the front end of each of them has two body-color tabs that meet a center bar in the grille. Some trim levels use copious amounts of chrome, others focus more on keeping things body-color, and some use black accents, so buyers can choose less or more chrome for their truck. The value trims have “Chevrolet” stamped in the center bar, with a small bow tie below, on the lower right. Higher up the line, the bar has the Chevrolet logo in the center. Opt for the Trail Boss, and the truck sits taller thanks to the lifted suspension, and the blacked-out wheels and door handles give the Silverado attitude.
Favorite FeaturesTOWING TECH
There’s a handy checklist for connecting a trailer, and you can store five trailer profiles. You can monitor the trailer tires’ pressures, and can test the trailer lights by yourself (usually a 2-person job), all through a cool smartphone app. An available rear camera shows you what’s behind your trailer. In addition, an alarm sounds if the trailer is disconnected while your truck is locked.
10-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
While you don’t need to spend the extra money on the 6.2-liter V8, with that investment you get this gem of a transmission. Its quick, smooth shifts make driving the 6.2-equipped Chevrolet Silverado especially satisfying. Hopefully, Chevrolet will expand the 10-speed’s availability in the future.
Standard FeaturesThe Work Truck, the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado’s base model, uses a 4.3-liter V6 engine with Adaptive Fuel Management (GM’s previous-generation fuel-management system), a 6-speed automatic transmission, 4-wheel disc brakes, and 17-inch painted steel wheels. Buyers can get a vinyl or cloth 40/20/40-split-bench seat. The Teen Driver safety suite comes on every Silverado. Chevrolet’s Infotainment 3 system is standard, operated through a 7-inch touch screen. Bluetooth is standard, as is Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity, and you get one USB port and one 12-volt outlet. Audio is channeled through a 6-speaker system. Silverados get 12 cargo tie-downs in the bed, plus CornerSteps in the rear bumper. Remote keyless entry, rear-window defogger, cruise control and power mirrors are optional, as is a spray-on bedliner.
Factory OptionsYou can get the 6.2-liter V8 with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and a max trailering package and Z71 off-road package are offered. Wheels sizes go up to 22 inches. Trailer tech, including the auxiliary trailer camera, is available, as is a power up/down tailgate. Auto stop/start is available with LT and above models. An 8-inch screen and a 7-speaker Bose audio system are offered, as are two 120-volt power outlets, a surround-vision camera setup, rear camera mirror, 15-inch head-up display, heated power side mirrors, front and rear heated leather seats, heated steering wheel, a sunroof, and wireless smartphone charging. The Trail Boss includes a 2-inch suspension lift, locking rear differential, skidplates, off-road tires and Rancho shocks.
Engine & Transmission2019 Chevrolet Silverados will be available in 2-wheel drive (2WD) and 4-wheel drive (4WD) forms and with a choice of six engine/transmission combinations, including two different versions of GM’s 5.3-liter V8. For 2019, there are two types of cylinder-management systems to improve fuel economy. Active Fuel Economy is the better-known cylinder shut-off system that has helped boost GM truck mpg. New for 2019 is Dynamic Fuel Management, designed to fine-tune the balance between efficiency and power demand. It lets the engine operate anywhere between two and eight cylinders, within 17 different patterns. The new Silverado is initially available with both 5.3-liter V8s, as well as the 6.2-liter, in many of the available trim levels.

The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado is one of the best-selling trucks in America, thanks to its well-rounded portfolio of strong performance, reliability and quiet, comfortable interiors. Known as a traditional, middle-of-the-road full-size pickup truck, for 2019, the all-new Silverado uses technology and modern engineering to keep the Chevy capable and tough while making it lighter, more fuel efficient and roomier inside. The truck segment is particularly competitive this year, as the Ram 1500 and GMC Sierra are also all-new, and the top-selling Ford F-150 continues to evolve and improve, further cementing its place as the half-ton-truck benchmark. The Silverado is still recognizable as a Chevrolet truck, but its new design advances this pickup’s styling far beyond what it once was.

Driving the Used 2019 Dodge ChallengerGiven the wide range of Challenger models and equipment, the driving experience for each is unlike the other. The SXT’s 305-horsepower V6 has plenty of power for the novice, and even offers the option of all-wheel drive. The same setup can be found in the GT, only with more features and suspension upgrades. The R/T offers the legendary 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine with 372 horsepower, while the R/T Scat Pack’s 392 V8 delivers an impressive 485 horses. The SRT Hellcat’s 717-horsepower 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8 is trumped only by the new-for-2019 Hellcat Redeye that delivers up an astounding 797 horsepower for a zero-to-60-mph run of just 3.4 seconds, a 10.8-second quarter-mile time and a top speed of 203 mph. The Widebody models come with wider wheels and tires for better grip, and Dodge offers a dizzying array of colors, add-ons and features to make the 2019 Challenger one of the most customizable performance cars money can buy.
Interior ComfortYou’d never know that the Challenger was capable of shenanigans from its pleasant and comfortable interior. The touch screen in the center is an old friend, enhanced this year with Uconnect 8.4, which brings Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s a retro feel that still looks modern, and we like the big driver-info center between the main gauges. No doubt, the thick rear pillars take some getting used to, but blind-spot warning and a rearview camera make the Challenger easy to drive. The rear seat can actually fit three across, unusual for this class, and the trunk is enormous, albeit with a high liftover.
Exterior StylingThe Challenger’s classic long-hood/short-deck proportions and wide stance grumble “performance” in every single model, and with their flared fenders and other details, the Widebody Hellcat and R/T models shout it outright. Details like hood scoops, badging and optional stripes throw in a retro feel. It just looks cool, successfully fighting the urge to be overly old-fashioned, and remains sleek and modern with a timeless appeal and the masculine swagger of an MMA champion. And if that swagger isn’t enough you can also get some of the bright colors with the fun names from back in the day, like IndiGO Blue, White Knuckle and Plum Crazy.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE
We all know muscle cars are all about blistering straight-line performance, but the Challenger SXT and GT models with all-wheel drive take a different tack. This feature not only improves the Challenger’s cornering and handling, but also winter-weather driving ability, something no other muscle car offers.
SRT HELLCAT REDEYE
Borrowing much of last year’s Demon components, the SRT Hellcat Redeye delivers an impressive performance-to-dollar ratio, with an eye-popping 797-horsepower 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8 yet with a starting price under $75,000.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Dodge Challenger SXT comes with the V6 engine, a Uconnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touch screen that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with Bluetooth, USB and auxiliary inputs, 2-zone automatic climate control, remote start and a host of additional convenience features. There are eight different Challenger models, each with its own list of “standard” equipment, but generally the higher up you go, the more stuff you get. Hound’s-tooth cloth seats are standard on all models, while an 8-speed automatic transmission is standard on V6 models and optional on V8 models.
Factory OptionsThe Challenger SXT and GT add all-wheel drive to V6 models, while the Challenger R/T gets the 5.7-liter V8. We recommend the Performance Handling Package for 5.7-liter models to upgrade the suspension and brakes. Challenger R/T Scat Pack 392 comes with the bigger V8 and generally nicer interior and equipment levels. The supercharged SRT Hellcat and Hellcat Widebody are basically loaded from the factory. Unlike the previous Demon, the SRT Hellcat Redeye comes with a back seat and can be upgraded with the same features as the Hellcat. We recommend the Uconnect 8.4 system, which enhances the infotainment with a bigger screen and navigation.
Engine & TransmissionIn the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) SXT and GT, a 305-horsepower 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 is the standard engine, with all-wheel drive (AWD) offered as an option on both trims. Moving to the R/T brings the first in a series of Hemi V8s, in this case a 375-horsepower 5.7-liter unit and a 6-speed manual transmission (the 8-speed automatic reduces horsepower to 372). The R/T Scat Pack is powered by a 6.4-liter Hemi V8, also known as the 392, rated at 485 horsepower with either the manual or 8-speed automatic. The SRT Hellcat adds a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with 717 horsepower, which would make it the king of the hill if it weren’t for the 797-horsepower SRT Hellcat Redeye. All V8-powered Challengers except the Redeye can be ordered with a 6-speed manual transmission, but the 8-speed automatic doesn’t shortchange performance. Obviously, none of these cars are fuel-economy kings, although the V6 models aren’t bad.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2019, the Dodge Challenger gets a new trim, the 797-horsepower Hellcat Redeye. The standard Hellcat’s horsepower rises to 717, and numerous trim and option upgrades are shuffled throughout the Challenger’s simplified lineup. All R/T Scat Pack models gain the power-bulge aluminum hood from the Hellcat, while the R/T version now comes in Widebody form.
In the world of muscle cars, the 2019 Dodge Challenger is an exceptional, competent machine. Built on the same platform as the Dodge Charger, the Challenger is larger than the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro, meaning it has a usable rear seat and trunk. In the areas of performance, the Challenger runs the gamut, starting with the 305-horsepower SXT and GT, all the way up to the fire-breathing 797-horsepower SRT Hellcat Redeye. Of course, most buyers will be more than happy with the R/T trims that offer impressive power, a surprisingly comfortable ride and a level of technology, features and 5-star crash rating the original Challenger could only dream of offering.

Driving the Used 2019 Toyota HighlanderWe like the Highlander for its comfort, high seating position and smooth operation. Unless you’re really pinching pennies and don’t care about meandering in the slow lane, skip the 4-cylinder that’s only available in the base Highlander. Opt instead for the V6 or the hybrid Highlander, which pairs a V6 with an electric motor. Both offer brisk acceleration, even with a car full of kids. Both are also quite fuel efficient, with the V6 returning up to 27 mpg and the hybrid 30 mpg. Whichever powertrain you choose, Toyota’s Highlander is an excellent family hauler. It has good steering feel, a good turning radius, and a comfortable yet controlled ride. While still not as athletic or fun to drive as the Mazda CX-9, the Highlander SE brings a little extra spice to the party thanks to a sport-tuned suspension.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Toyota Highlander has three rows of seats and the ability to accommodate seven or eight passengers. If you need to seat up to eight, go with the 2nd-row bench. Otherwise, there is a pair of captain’s seats available in the second row that are more comfortable but reduce total seat count to seven. Both rear rows fold nearly flat for better cargo flexibility. If you’re not using the third row on a regular basis, you’ll probably find it’s better left down, as cargo space is at a premium with it up. In front, we think the driver’s seat is above average in comfort, and depending on trim can be outfitted in leather and even offer heating and ventilation functions. Storage cubbies, cup holders and USB ports abound — all helpful for making trips less stressful. All Highlanders have a central touch screen for audio and information functionality — 6.1 inches in lower trims and eight inches in higher ones.
Exterior StylingWe generally like the Highlander’s look. It’s large but not imposing, muscular yet handsome. It has more a squared-off look vs. the rounded Honda Pilot. In this respect, the Highlander looks the part of a more traditional, slabbed SUV. Up front, it’s hard to miss that massive grille. Base models come with 18-inch wheels, while higher trims wear 19-inchers. All models except the base Highlander LE have a handy flip-up rear hatch window, which makes it easy to load and unload the rear without opening the entire tailgate. And all but base models include a power-operated tailgate.
Favorite FeaturesTOYOTA SAFETY SENSE
No matter which new Toyota Highlander you buy, it will come with this impressive suite of safety and driver-assistance features. Toyota Safety Sense will do everything from detect pedestrians and keep you within lanes to warn of a collision and even automatically apply the brakes if a collision appears imminent. Also helpful is adaptive cruise control.
DRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM
With the Highlander’s Driver Easy Speak, cries of “DON’T MAKE ME PULL THIS CAR OVER” are reduced to a mere vocal warning via an intercom system that allows the driver’s intention to be conveyed loud and clear to 3rd-row-seat occupants.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Highlander is offered in five main trims, starting with the LE. That base model is pretty basic but does include keyless entry, a total of five USB ports, the Entune infotainment system with 6.1-inch touch screen, and the Toyota Safety Sense suite of safety features. We recommend skipping that base trim for a better experience, even if it’s just one trim to LE Plus. That grants the proper V6 engine, power tailgate with flip-up hatch window, tri-zone climate control, 10-way-power driver’s seat, better-quality fabric seating, and a more robust Entune infotainment system with the larger, 8-inch screen.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, Highlander XLE models have a leather interior, navigation, moonroof, power-adjustable passenger seat, the Easy Speak intercom system, and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Highlander SE variants include a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch wheels, and darkened exterior aesthetics. Top-line Highlander Limited models include blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated and ventilated front seats, a premium JBL audio system, and standard seating for seven (2nd-row captain’s chairs). All-wheel drive is optional on all V6 models, and the Highlander can be further outfitted with a rear-seat Blu-ray entertainment system and, for Limited models, a panoramic moonroof and bird’s-eye rearview camera.
Engine & TransmissionThe Toyota Highlander offers three powertrain choices. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels (FWD) through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there’s the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, and comes standard on the Highlander hybrid. The 4-cylinder Toyota Highlander is only rated to tow 1,500 pounds, while V6 variants can pull a more robust 5,000 pounds. Note that the Highlander V6 uses an engine start/stop system to save fuel. That means it’s perfectly normal for the engine to shut off at stoplights. If that’s not your cup of tea, the system can be disabled with the press of a button.

The 2019 Toyota Highlander is among the most recommendable crossover SUVs for busy families. With three rows and seating for seven or eight passengers depending on configuration, the Highlander is roomy, versatile and easy to drive and live with. The 2019 Highlander is available in several trims, but all are exceptionally safe thanks to a robust suite of accident-avoidance and driver-assistance systems. A 4-cylinder is offered in base models, but you’re better off with the more powerful — and more efficient — V6. An impressive hybrid model is also available. Toyota’s midsize SUV remains a strong competitor to the Honda Pilot, not to mention newer competitors like the Volkswagen Atlas and Subaru Ascent. About our only qualm with the Highlander is its lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.

Driving the Used 2019 Subaru ForesterThe 2019 Subaru Forester is much quieter than the previous model, and its electric-assist steering, which seems a bit heavy at first, feels normal after a few minutes at the helm. Ride quality is outstanding, and even though the new Forester has 8.7 inches of ground clearance (the same as the outgoing model), body lean in corners is kept well in check. The updated 2.5-liter boxer engine, with 182 horsepower (up from 170), feels adequate if not overwhelming, yet still strong enough to move this 3,500-pound compact SUV up mountain passes without obvious strain. The CVT, updated by Subaru to be lighter and quieter, “downshifts” and “upshifts” like a traditional automatic when the driver is aggressive with the throttle. Subaru has worked to improve Forester brake feel, and this can be felt in the reduction of pedal stroke needed before speed retardation occurs. The Limited model that KBB tested at the Forester’s press preview near Asheville, North Carolina, had a particularly active beeper for lane-keep assist, and it took time to find the shut-off switch (it’s on the headliner, above the rearview mirror). If you’re the sort who takes corners aggressively, a new standard torque-vectoring system automatically applies the brakes to the inside wheels to help the Forester follow its intended path and not push wide. Last: If there’s one area needing improvement, it’s the automatic stop/start system, new for 2019. Although designed to be unobtrusive and save fuel while your Subaru idles at stoplights, the automatic restarts aren’t as smooth as they should be. Fortunately, the system can be shut off, which we did.
Interior ComfortEven though the 2019 Forester is narrower than competitors such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV4, Subaru has widened the front seating area by 1.2 inches, which enabled the manufacturer to move the front seats nearly an inch farther apart, making the area feel far roomier. Improved materials and a new wraparound dash highlight the 5-seat interior, and the infotainment touch screen (either a 6.5-incher or the preferable 8.0-inch unit) is right where you’d expect it to be — within easy reach atop the center stack. And thanks to the added wheelbase, the new Forester has significantly better rear-seat legroom. A 6-foot-tall passenger now fits very comfortably behind a 6-foot-tall driver. Impressive.
Exterior StylingSubaru clearly didn’t want to mess with success, so the all-new 2019 Forester doesn’t stray too far visually. And while this new Forester looks much like the previous one, the pleasant update is just enough to let us know that significant improvements have been made beneath the skin. Front, side and rear underguards are standard, as is lower body cladding to protect against mud and rocks. Also, roof rails are standard on all but the base model. The new Sport model is distinguished by its gloss-black exterior trim and orange accents on the black underguards and roof-rail mounts, plus orange interior stitching and other accents.
Favorite FeaturesENORMOUS CARGO OPENING
At 51.3 inches wide, the Forester’s rear cargo opening is huge, 5.3 inches wider than before and a full six inches better than the nearest competitor’s. Golf bags don’t need to be tilted to fit in back. An extra 1.1 extra inches of space between the rear-wheel intrusions also helps.
DRIVERFOCUS
This new tech, standard on the Forester Touring, uses infrared sensors and facial recognition to identify driver distraction or fatigue. If the driver has looked away from the road for three seconds, DriverFocus will sound a warning and even slow the car to a stop if necessary.
Standard FeaturesKey standard features on every 2019 Subaru Forester include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus EyeSight, the driver-assist safety suite featuring adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, pre-collision throttle management, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist. Also standard: trailer-stability assist, brake hold, automatic climate control, electronic parking brake, automatic power door locks (a first for the Forester) and LED headlights. The 2019 Forester also has active grille shutters in the front bumper (for better fuel economy), plus a rearview-camera washer, which will come in handy if you spend a lot of time on dirt roads.
Factory OptionsThe base 2019 Subaru Forester is available with 17-inch alloy wheels and roof rails, a package bargain-priced at $600. On the Forester Premium, there’s an available all-weather package and push-button start, plus blind-spot detection, lane-change assist and dual USB ports in the center rear console. The Forester Sport can be ordered with the 8-inch MultiMedia Plus system and a 9-speaker Harman Kardon stereo, while automatic reverse braking is available on the more opulent Limited. The top Forester, the Touring, can be ordered with Black or Saddle Brown perforated interior leather. In-vehicle Wi-Fi is available through your Subaru dealer.
Engine & TransmissionOne engine is available in the new Forester, a 2.5-liter flat-4 that produces 182 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 176 lb-ft of torque at 4,400 rpm (versus last year’s 170 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 174 lb-ft of torque at 4,100 rpm). Subaru says 90 percent of its parts are new, and this includes a stronger block and a new direct-injection system. This boxer powerplant mounts to one transmission: a CVT built and developed by Subaru. In Sport and Touring Foresters, the CVT features a manual mode that simulates a 7-speed automatic transmission via shift paddles. On all 2019 Foresters, however, there’s a new SI-Drive system allowing the driver to select between smooth (Intelligent) or crisp (Sport) powertrain performance. EPA fuel economy figures for the 2019 Subaru Forester are 26-mpg city/33-mpg highway/29-mpg combined.

All-new for 2019
Roomier on the inside, but only slightly larger

The Forester has been a big seller for Subaru, accounting for 27 percent of its U.S. sales. Here’s why: This Japan-built SUV artfully blends good interior capacity with a reasonably small overall size, which makes it a super-handy vehicle around town. And if you live in areas with harsh weather, or you occasionally like to explore areas with dirt roads, the Forester also shines, thanks to its 8.7 inches of ground clearance, rugged construction and full-time all-wheel drive. For 2019, the Subaru has completely revamped the Forester, keeping its spirit intact while replacing its chassis with the company’s strong new global platform already put to good use in the popular Crosstrek.

Driving the Used 2019 Chevrolet EquinoxWith three distinct powerplants, the 2019 Chevy Equinox has three distinct driving characteristics. The standard 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder is more than satisfactory. With a 6-speed automatic driving either the front wheels or all four wheels, the little turbo handily gets the Equinox going. We found it had enough grunt to tackle hilly roads, but it’s no barn-burner. The optional 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, however, packs significantly more power. Its 80-plus-horsepower advantage over the base engine grants surprising, chirp-the-tires acceleration off the line and plenty of power for passing. Floor it in a front-wheel-drive version, and you’ll be dealing with torque steer. Then there’s the diesel engine. Like the base gasoline model, this one won’t win many races, but it’s a fuel-economy champ. With an EPA-rated fuel economy of up to 39 mpg, nothing this side of a hybrid comes close. No matter which engine you choose, the Equinox has a ride quality that favors comfort and quiet over, say, the athleticism and nimbleness of a Mazda CX-5.
Interior ComfortChevy’s 2019 Equinox has a sensible and roomy 5-passenger interior. The front seats are supportive and good partners on trips. The 2nd-row bench has a recline feature, but we found the angle a little too sloped when in the max position. Conversely, it folds nearly flat in a 60/40 split, a big help when hauling gear. In all, the Equinox boasts 63.5 cubic feet of space with the rear seats down. That’s notably less than the Honda CR-V’s 75.8 cubic feet, but still quite usable. We also like the sub floor in the rear cargo area to secure smaller objects and keep them out of sight. Up front, the touch-screen system is easy to see and use, and controls for audio and climate are simple and in plain view. Most versions of the Equinox have basic cloth seating, but you can spruce it up with leather in the top-line Premier trim.
Exterior StylingLooking the part of a younger and smaller sibling to the midsize Chevy Traverse, the new Equinox retains a fresh look all its own. At just over 183 inches in length, the Equinox crossover SUV is large enough to have presence, but small enough to easily fit in parking spaces and garages. Roof rails are available to add utility and bolder SUV looks, while a hands-free tailgate on higher trims makes it easier to load and unload groceries and gear. Various packages, like the new Lights and Bright offering, add elements like a chrome grille surround and 19-inch wheels. Models with the 2.0-liter turbo engine stand apart with dual-exhaust outlets.
Favorite FeaturesDIESEL ENGINE
The new Equinox stands alone in its class with the availability of a diesel engine. And while diesels are (again) combating a bad reputation, those in the know understand that these powertrains have impressive torque and fuel efficiency. Emissions, meanwhile, are negated via fluid easily added every few thousand miles.
2.0-LITER TURBO ENGINE
The Equinox’s other optional engine, a 2.0-liter turbo, changes the character of Chevy’s crossover SUV. With 252 horsepower on tap, it makes the Equinox notably quicker. Accelerating from a stop becomes something of a guilty pleasure with this engine, available on LT and Premier trims.
Standard FeaturesThe Chevy Equinox is available in four main trims: L, LS, LT and Premier. The least expensive Equinox comes with a 1.5-liter turbo engine, keyless entry and push-button start, 7-inch infotainment system with four USB ports and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, 17-inch wheels, and the Teen Driver system that can set parameters and relay information on driving habits. Other highlights include General Motors’ OnStar telematics system and a subscription-based 4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi. The LS trim adds a compact spare tire, compass and carpeted floormats, plus allows for all-wheel drive and a few other options, but most buyers will be better off in at least an Equinox LT trim. The LT opens the door to the optional engines and comes with amenities like 8-way power-operated driver’s seat, SiriusXM satellite radio, tinted rear glass, high-intensity headlights, and color driver-information screen.
Factory OptionsThe top-line Equinox Premier model includes leather interior, heated front seats with driver-position memory, hands-free power tailgate, 8-inch infotainment system with optional navigation, dual-zone climate control, roof rails, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Unfortunately, and unlike competitors like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, you have to spring for the top-line Premier model, then still pay extra for safety features like forward-collision alert with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Other options include a Bose audio system that sounds much better than the subpar standard one, ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, and panoramic sunroof. A Redline Edition that’s available on models with the 2.0-liter turbo engine adds aggressive aesthetics like a black grille, black mirror caps and black Chevy bow-tie badge.
Engine & TransmissionYou have a choice of three engines in the 2019 Chevy Equinox. All are 4-cylinder and come standard in front-wheel drive (FWD), with all-wheel drive (AWD) optional for better traction on slippery surfaces. Standard is a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine with 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque. That’s enough oomph for most tasks, and is rated to tow 1,500 pounds. Optional is a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with 252 horsepower/260 lb-ft of torque that makes the Equinox feel quite a bit faster. It is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds. Then there’s the Equinox’s X factor — a diesel engine. The 1.6-liter turbodiesel has 137 horsepower/240 lb-ft of torque, but a remarkable fuel-economy rating of up to 39 mpg. The 1.5-liter gasoline engine and the diesel use a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0-liter turbo has a 9-speed automatic. All Equinox models have an idle start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle, such as at stoplights. Restarts can be annoying, and unlike in other automakers, the system can’t be deactivated.

Revamped last year as a slightly smaller but more sophisticated version of its former self, the 2019 Equinox is Chevrolet’s answer to compact-crossover SUVs like the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Ford Escape. It compares well to those rivals in its feature set and driving manners, and offers something no other can match: a diesel engine that earns nearly 40 mpg. Also available is a potent 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that can be had in lieu of the standard 1.5-liter turbo-4. The Equinox boasts laudable technology with standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration and 4G LTE connectivity. But to get active safety features such as lane-keep assist and automatic emergency braking, you must buy the highest trim and then spend extra on options.

From base LX and sporty SX to the efficient EX and hybrids, the Kia Optima meets multiple needs and budgets.","ConsIf you’re used to the higher seating position of an SUV or a crossover SUV, it might be tough to adjust back into a lower sedan such as the Optima, even with its better driving dynamics. Also, an all-wheel-drive Optima is not available.",23820,"The 2019 Kia Optima Hybrid starts at $28,090, while the Optima Plug-in Hybrid starts at $35,390. The PHEV, however, is eligible for nearly $5,000 in federal tax credits.
 Overall, the Optima’s prices are in line with the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and the rest of the midsize-sedan segment. Check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see how much others in your area paid for their 2019 Optimas. The Kia Optima is becoming a better long-term investment, beating half the segment in resale value.
Driving the Used 2019 Kia OptimaAlthough most people don’t think of the 2019 Kia Optima as a sports sedan, the turbocharged SX comes awfully close. While many newer sedans benefit from seven, eight or even more gear ratios, the Optima’s 6-speed automatic transmission — with paddles mounted to the back of a new flat-bottom steering wheel — works just fine. The transmission shifts smoothly and quickly, especially in Sport, one of the Optima’s four electronic driving modes. In spite of the SX’s sport-tuned suspension and low-profile P235/45-18 tires, the ride quality is neither too firm nor too floaty, and it’s complemented by electric-assist steering with a light but natural feel.
 In LX and S guise, Kia’s midsize Optima is geared more toward comfort, and the naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with 185 horsepower is adequate for most drivers. The Optima EX, with its turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine, ups the torque quotient while also returning an impressive 37 mpg on the highway, aided by a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that’s not as refined as the conventional 6-speed automatic.
 If high fuel efficiency is the priority, the 2019 Kia Optima hybrid and plug-in hybrid deliver. Though not quite as efficient as the Honda Accord Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid, at up to 45 mpg, the Kia Optima Hybrid is impressive nonetheless. The plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Optima, meanwhile, can travel up to 29 miles on electricity alone. Perhaps more relevant, it is eligible for carpool stickers in California.
Interior ComfortThe 5-seat cabin of the 2019 Kia Optima SX is highlighted by high-quality materials, a huge glove box, easy-to-read gauges and a 10-speaker harman/kardon sound system. The front seats — Euro-styled buckets unique to the SX with large side bolsters — are trimmed in black leather with perforated seating surfaces done in red hide. Heated and cooled, these seats offer excellent cornering support but are remarkably comfortable over long distances.
 Headroom front and back, even with the giant panoramic moonroof, is excellent, and there’s enough legroom for the Optima to accommodate four 6-footers comfortably. The Optima’s trunk is spacious at nearly 16 cubic feet. The Optima Hybrid gives up some space, coming in at 13.4, while the Kia Optima Plug-in Hybrid and its larger battery pack mean a smaller trunk that’s around 10 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingKBB staffers agree: The Optima is a styling success, a better-looking midsize sedan than its mechanically similar Hyundai Sonata cousin. And for 2019 the Optima has been made even more striking, thanks to an updated front fascia (with LED running lights) that shows a clear DNA link to the sporty rear-wheel-drive Kia Stinger. While it’s fair to say the Optima hasn’t changed significantly for 2019, it didn’t really need to; this midsize Kia sedan already boasted clean lines and a subtly aggressive stance.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SAFETY SUITE The new suite of standard safety technologies on the 209 Kia Optima is extensive. It includes Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Forward Collision Warning, Driver Attention Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning and Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Warning (your new best friend in crowded parking lots).
ANDROID AUTO & APPLE CARPLAY Android Auto and Apple CarPlay became standard on the Optima in 2018, providing the same friendly interface you’ve grown to appreciate on your phone. We love this tech now as much as we did then.
Standard FeaturesKia’s new Advanced Driver Assistance System (Blind-Spot Collision Warning, Parking Distance Warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Warning, Forward Collision Warning, Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Lane Change Assist, Lane-Keeping Assist Line and Lane Departure Warning) is included on standard 2019 Optimas (and remains optional on the hybrids). Also, UVO telematics is now tiered for easier use, and we continue to celebrate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which were added to the Optima’s list of standard equipment last year.
 Optima LX and S models are powered by a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The EX has a 1.6-liter turbo 4-cylinder and a dual-clutch 7-speed automatic gearbox, while the SX — distinguished by a honeycomb grille and red brake calipers — is motivated by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder mated to a 6-speed automatic.
 Other standard equipment on all 2019 Kia Optimas includes air conditioning, an 8-inch thin-film transistor (TFT) touch screen, a rearview camera, Sirius satellite radio and Bluetooth, along with aux and USB inputs.
Factory OptionsAs the top Optima, the SX is generously equipped but still can be ordered with the Limited Package. Included in this $3,800 package are Nappa interior leather, a flat-bottom steering wheel, 18-in. dark satin wheels, a black headliner, chrome side sills, body-color mirrors and rear spoiler, plus interior door and dash trim featuring perforated silver stitching. The package includes a handy surround-view monitor, SXL badges and four other colors of interior leather (besides standard black).
 Premium packages are available on the base Optima, the LX, along with the EX. On the LX, the $2,000 package includes a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a panoramic sunroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gloss-black door pillars. On the EX, the Premium Package, a $3,100 option, adds a power-adjustable front-passenger seat, a harman/kardon sound system (with 14 speakers), ambient lighting, a heated steering wheel and dual-zone full-automatic climate control. If you’d like to order a base 2019 Kia Optima S with a sunroof, you can — it’s available as a stand-alone $1,000 option.
Engine & TransmissionThe Kia Optima LX and S models are equipped with a naturally aspirated (non-turbocharged) 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that sends 185 horsepower to the front wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission. The EX model has better low-end torque and fuel economy, courtesy of a 178-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine that mates to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.
 If you’re looking for more power, the Optima SX’s turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder generates 245 horsepower in a smooth and linear fashion. This engine mates to a conventional 6-speed automatic that’s more refined than the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox in the EX.
 Note: The Optima Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid are available as 2019 models, but they are built in South Korea (as opposed to Kia’s plant in West Point, Georgia) and unchanged for 2019. As such, they continue to use a 2.0-liter non-turbo gasoline engine paired to an electric motor. The Kia Optima Plug-in Hybrid has a larger battery pack that allows the car to travel up to 29 miles on electricity alone.
 In EPA fuel economy, the Optima LX is rated up to 35-mpg highway, while the EX manages 37. The SX, in spite of its added power, still gets a respectable 30 mpg on the highway.

Read Full Review","What's New?Most significant, Kia’s new Advanced Driver Assistance System (Blind-Spot Collision Warning, Parking Distance Warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Warning, Forward Collision Warning, Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Lane Change Assist, Lane-Keeping Assist Line and Lane Departure Warning) is now included on the standard 2019 Optima, and is optional on the hybrids.
Moreover, the Optima’s UVO (voice recognition) telematics system is now broken down into three tiers to make it easier to understand and use. The 2019 Kia Optima also benefits from mildly revised front styling that links it to the Kia Stinger sports sedan.
As an attractive midsize sedan offering good fuel economy, technology, value and everyday ease of use, the Kia Optima is among the company’s best-selling models. Last year, the Optima was made more enticing with a standard 7-inch touch screen offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This year it gets even better as all 2019 Optimas are equipped with a standard suite of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Foremost among these new safety technologies is Forward Collision Avoidance Assist, which automatically applies the brakes to prevent a frontal collision (or minimize the severity of an impact).
 In addition to turbocharged engine options in standard models, the 2019 Kia Optima can also be had as a 45-mpg hybrid or a plug-in hybrid that can run up to 29 miles on electricity alone before the gasoline engine kicks in.
 As with all new Kia models, the Optima has a superb 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty that far exceeds the warranties of rivals like the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry and Chevrolet Malibu.

If you require an automatic transmission, expect to pay closer to $24,000, a big jump. The mid-level Frontier SV, in King Cab or Crew Cab form, is priced at around $24,500 and $27,500, respectively. If you want to buy a long-wheelbase Crew Cab Frontier SV with 4WD, you’ll pay around $31,500. At the top of the Frontier pricing spectrum is the short-wheelbase Crew Cab 4WD SL, priced at nearly $38,000. As always, please check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price before buying to see what others in your area are paying for their Frontier pickup truck. Nissan’s midsize pickup holds its value well, but not quite like the Toyota Tacoma does.
Driving the Used 2019 Nissan Frontier Crew CabThe new Frontier, though basic in nature compared to newer pickups, is comfortable. The well-shaped seats accommodate drivers of various sizes, and the suspension doesn’t toss you around. Even on rough roads with an empty bed, the Frontier isn’t bounced around, as you might expect. Our most recent test truck was a Frontier King Cab in base S trim. White with a gray interior, it was good basic transportation, a work truck with a 152-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission that was easy to shift. Clutch effort was light, which was much appreciated in stop-and-go traffic. Power from the 4-cylinder felt adequate around town, but the 16-valve engine felt taxed while getting the fully loaded Frontier up to highway speeds. Nor is sound-deadening a Frontier strong point; wind noise intrudes from around the mirrors, and there’s a fair amount of rumble from the engine and the road.
Interior ComfortNo one is going to confuse the simple cabin of the 2019 Nissan Frontier with that of, say, a luxurious new Ram pickup, but we appreciate its functional and elemental nature, which is very much in line with this pickup’s intended purpose. Open the rear-hinged doors of the King Cab model and you’ll find a pair of cramped seats that are suitable for children and short rides. If you plan on carrying passengers, opt for the Crew Cab. It has four traditional doors and room for three adults across the rear bench. The rear seats on all Frontier models flip up for more space, and the front-passenger seat can fold flat.
Exterior StylingBy today’s standards, the Nissan Frontier looks a bit conservative, but we feel it’s handsome in an understated way, even with its prominently flared fenders and aggressive-looking wheels. This midsize Nissan pickup also boasts a masculine quality, especially the Desert Runner and PRO-4X models with their off-road tires and available roof racks and crossbars. A long bed is available on the Frontier Crew Cab; it has the same 73.3-inch bed length as the smaller-cabin King Cab.
Favorite FeaturesPRO-4X The Nissan Frontier Pro-4X model boasts some serious off-road cred. Well beyond just 4-wheel drive, the Frontier Pro-4X packs a heavy-duty suspension, Bilstein high-pressure performance gas shock absorbers, skidplates protecting the fuel tank, oil pan and transfer case; 16-inch wheels, 265/75R16 All-Terrain tires and an electronically locking rear differential.
 MIDNIGHT EDITION PACKAGE Introduced in 2018, the Frontier Midnight Edition makes an already attractive pickup look even sharper. Visual enhancements include a gloss-black grille and 18-inch gloss-black alloy wheels, plus black step rails, body-color bumpers and black mirrors, door handles and badging. The Midnight Edition is available only on black, silver and white Frontiers.
Standard FeaturesThe King Cab S model is quite basic, with a 5-speed manual transmission and crank windows, although air conditioning, cruise control, an AM/FM/CD stereo and Bluetooth are now standard. Power windows and mirrors, and a USB-equipped audio system are available on the more civilized SV trims, which also include NissanConnect with mobile apps such as Facebook, and streaming audio like Pandora and iHeartRadio. The Crew Cab SL adds leather seats, Rockford Fosgate audio and a standard V6 engine. All 2-wheel-drive Frontiers have a brake-actuated limited-slip rear differential; all 4-wheel-drive models are fitted with a conventional limited-slip rear.
Factory OptionsFor 2019, Frontier SV models offer a popular SV Value Truck package that includes heated cloth seats, fog lights, a sliding bed extender, sonar parking sensors, dual-zone A/C, an auto-dimming mirror and a bed with a spray-in liner and four Utili-track tie-down anchors. While it seems a little strange that the Desert Runner is a 2-wheel-drive (2WD) model, it is fitted with Bilstein off-road shocks and off-road wheels and tires. The 4-wheel-drive (4WD) PRO-4X Frontiers add an electronic locking rear differential and skidplates. A Premium Package with power-adjustable leather seats and heated outside mirrors is available on the Crew Cab PRO-4X, while a power moonroof is available on the SL (standard) and SV (optional). The Midnight Edition is available only on the SV with automatic transmission.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine on the 2019 Nissan Frontier King Cab is a 152-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, which is paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. While the 4-cylinder is slightly more efficient than the 4.0-liter V6 (available in King Cab, standard in Crew Cab models or any 4WD Frontier), it’s a better choice. It produces 261 horsepower, so the V6-powered Frontiers have plenty of power with either the 6-speed manual or the 5-speed automatic. The 4-cylinder Frontier has a decent tow rating of 3,500 pounds; the 2WD Frontier V6 models can tow up to 6,500 pounds. Although the Frontier runs on regular unleaded gasoline, its EPA fuel economy falls short of the Chevy Colorado.

Driving the Used 2019 Jeep Grand CherokeeDespite its impressive off-road credentials, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a remarkably civilized prospect. In both city and highway driving, the Grand Cherokee exhibits the ride comfort of a luxury SUV with the power and handling of a large sedan. Straight-line performance varies by engine choice, but all models exhibit good cornering and braking, with minimal lean in hard turns. The steering still feels a bit soft and the boxy design experiences more wind noise than in sleeker rivals like the Nissan Murano or Ford Edge. Once off-road, however, the Grand Cherokee’s generous ground clearance and numerous 4×4 systems provide the confidence to go places the aforementioned competitors dare not tread. Those more interested in what the Grand Cherokee can do on road rather than off will no doubt gravitate to the performance models, with the 475-horsepower SRT trim claiming a 4.8-second 0-60-mph time, and the insane 707-horsepower Trackhawk slicing that time to a mere 3.4 seconds.
Interior ComfortDepending on trim, the Grand Cherokee spans from a reasonably comfortable SUV to one capable of giving some luxury brands a run for their money. All models are 2-row/5-passenger configurations — there is no 3rd-row option. This layout means good room for passengers and a healthy 36.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats. Folded, that space expands to 68.3 cubic feet. Base Laredo models look the part with cloth and manually adjusted front seats, but stepping up just one trim brings power operation to the driver. Higher-end models are awash in leather and feature heated and ventilated front seats.
Exterior StylingThe 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV has a muscular, handsome design. True to its off-road roots, the GC has 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with the performance-oriented SRT model sitting slightly lower (8.3 inches), and the high-performance Trackhawk lower still (8.1 inches). The new Trackhawk also stands out with quad tailpipes and “supercharged” emblazoned on the lower front doors. It also gets distinctive red tow hooks, an anti-glare hood decal, and 18-inch off-road wheels. Despite its tall profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, but you can opt for the power-operated liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesJEEP GRAND CHEROKEE TRACKHAWK
Putting a 707-horsepower supercharged engine in a Jeep might seem the height of absurdity, but we Americans love everything over the top, and that includes our cars. The Trackhawk can’t handle like its Hellcat cousins, but it does offer the traction of all-wheel drive and modest off-road ability.
QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION
When steel springs just aren’t enough, the Grand Cherokee’s optional Quadra-Lift air suspension provides five separate height settings ranging from near-car height for ease of entry to 10.6 inches for clearing the largest off-road obstacles. The Trailhawk trim gets a unique version for better off-road wheel articulation.
Standard FeaturesThe Grand Cherokee lineup now spans seven trims, including the roughly $88,000 Trackhawk high-performance SUV. Of course, most buyers will stay far south of that. Starting with the base Laredo, you get a V6 engine, new higher-resolution 7-inch touch-screen Uconnect system, blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, dual-zone climate control, parking sensors and a rearview camera. We recommend stepping up to at least a Limited model. This adds a power liftgate, power front seats, heated front and rear seats, and the ability to opt for the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 or 3.0-liter diesel V6.
Factory OptionsFrom advanced 4-wheel-drive (4WD) systems to an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect system with navigation and CarPlay/Android Auto capability, there’s a bevy of options available for the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Some can be had by climbing trims. The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, for example, comes with the Quadra-Drive II 4WD, plus creature comforts like ventilated front seats — a welcome feature on a hot day. Our ears are pleased with the premium Harman Kardon audio system. Active safety and driving features include adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist, which can move the vehicle back into a lane if it drifts, and automatic emergency braking if a collision appears imminent and the driver doesn’t take action.
Engine & TransmissionWhile Jeep offers no less than five engine options in the 2019 Grand Cherokee, most will roll out the door with either the 3.6-liter V6 or 5.7-liter Hemi V8. In truth the V6 has more than enough power for most needs, although the V8 is better for towing. A third choice is the 3.0-liter diesel V6 that offers more torque than the Hemi V8 and better fuel economy than the 3.6-liter V6. The high-performance Grand Cherokee SRT uses a 6.4-liter V8 that spits out 475 horsepower and can blast to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, while the Trackhawk boasts a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine borrowed from the Charger and Challenger Hellcat twins. With 707 horsepower, it screams to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds or less. The V6 engines come with 2-(rear)-wheel drive (2WD) or optional 4-wheel drive (4WD), while the V8 models are 4WD. All Grand Cherokees use an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Grand Cherokee is rated to tow an impressive 7,400 pounds.

As Jeep’s flagship SUV, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is as well regarded as its iconic stablemate, the Jeep Wrangler. This 5-passenger SUV is also known for its rugged off-road ability, luxurious interiors and powerful engine lineup. While competitively priced against such SUVs as the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano and Toyota 4Runner, many owners place the Grand Cherokee in the same league as the BMW X5, Land Rover Discovery and Volvo XC60. Of course, few rivals can match the big Jeep’s off-road ability, and none offer anything close to the 707-horsepower Trackhawk. Yet even in its less extravagant trims, the Grand Cherokee represents an outstanding value, with numerous standard features and cutting-edge options like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

Driving the Used 2019 BMW 5 SeriesAfter years of 5 Series cars appealing to enthusiasts, the previous generation received some criticism for being too luxurious. The new 5 Series moves the meter a little back toward the athletic, but without sacrificing smoothness. A driver could spend a leisurely day in comfort and serenity. Push it harder, though, and a deep well of ability gradually reveals itself. Selectable driving modes help in this regard; Sport is a good starting point. The 530i’s turbocharged 4-cylinder does a respectable job at the entry level, the plug-in hybrid version has its own virtues, the 540i is muscular, and the M550i xDrive is phenomenally quick.
Interior ComfortThis 2019 BMW 5 Series has an elegant dashboard design, covered either in simulated leather (SensaTec) or the real stuff. Switches and buttons are laid out sensibly, and the infotainment system (whose rotary control also has a touch-based operation; gesture control is optional) deploys a 10.25-inch screen. The jet-fighter transmission lever looks cool but can be awkward initially. There’s plenty of space to accommodate rear passengers. And the trunk is large: 18.7 cubic feet, easily enough for four golf bags.
Exterior StylingAll the usual BMW design cues are here, like the double-kidney grille and the Hofmeister kink in the rear side windows. In common with the larger 7 Series, the new 5 Series has a “hockey-stick” feature along the lower flanks. As a whole, the various shapes and lines work to emphasize the car’s width and length rather than its height. The BMW faithful will be happy, but the styling may not attract any new converts.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT ALL-WHEEL DRIVE
Every 2019 5 Series, even the 530e plug-in hybrid, is available with traction-enhancing all-wheel drive (AWD). BMW calls it xDrive. This marque is famed for its rear-drive (RWD) handling qualities and so distributes power 40/60 front to back. But all the power can go to either axle if necessary. Helping to make these split-second actions are sensors for lateral movement and steering angle.
REMOTE CONTROL PARKING
What might once have seemed like something from The Jetsons is now real. The 540i and M550i models allow their driver to get out and then maneuver the car into (and out of) tight parking spaces using buttons on the key fob.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 BMW 5 Series range starts off with the 530i. It has the lowest power output, but everything else is suitably lush for a car costing in excess of $50,000. As well as 18-inch alloy wheels and a moonroof, there are navigation with real-time traffic updates, 16-way power-adjustable front seats (with memory settings on the driver’s side), power-adjustable steering column, drive-mode selection, LED headlights, rearview camera, parking sensors, Apple CarPlay (previously an option), and advanced driver aids (blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, and lane-keeping alerts).
Factory OptionsExtras run the gamut from sensible to indulgent; all are tempting. A buyer may choose 20-way-adjustable front seats with heating/cooling/massaging functions, all-wheel drive, and a Bowers & Wilkins 1,400-watt/16-speaker setup, which is one of the absolute best automotive audio systems. An Executive package includes soft-closing doors and a powered rear sunshade; adaptive cruise control, side-collision avoidance and Traffic Jam Assist (partial self-driving) are in the Driver Assistance Plus bundle; a Dynamic Handling package brings an adaptive suspension, bigger brakes and rear-wheel steering.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2019 5 Series offers a variety of propulsion setups. The 530i has a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine making 248 horsepower. The 530e is a plug-in hybrid whose turbo-4 is augmented by an electric motor, for the same horsepower as the 530i, but slightly more torque. The 530e’s battery can be replenished in less than three hours using a 240-volt charger and has an electric-only range of 16 miles. The 540i is typical BMW territory — an inline-6 developing 335 horsepower. If the super-heated M5 is too much, there’s the 456-horsepower M550i that comes with all-wheel drive as standard. Each engine has an auto stop/start, but this function can be disabled. Every version employs an 8-speed automatic transmission.

A new Convenience package brings heated front seats, satellite radio and a powered trunk lid. The Premium package now includes wireless charging, Wi-Fi, head-up display, gesture control and automatic parallel parking.
To describe the 2019 BMW 5 Series merely as a premium-midsize sedan is to downplay the fact that this is one of the finest cars in the world. That sounds like crazy exaggeration, but consider the data. It’s spacious enough for most people’s needs, comes with plenty of luxury items and high-tech features (including a parking function using the key fob for remote control), the drivetrains are superb, and the ride quality/handling balance is close to perfect. We’re now a couple of years into its seventh generation and this freshness puts it on a par with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, while having a distinct edge over the Lexus GS and Audi A6 (a new generation of which debuts for 2019). Speaking of superb drivetrains, the high-performance 2019 BMW M5 is reviewed separately.

If you’re looking to be spoiled but not that spoiled, the Subaru Outback Limited is actually more accommodating both on- and off-road, plus you’ll have the option of a 6-cylinder engine.",43625,"Driving the Used 2016 Audi allroadWe love the way the 2016 Audi Allroad wagon rides and drives, but its fuel economy is woefully lacking. EPA figures aside, the Allroad’s potent 2.0-liter turbo is a perfect fit. We learned all about the Allroad’s capabilities on a recent mountain road trip where winter attacked us full force. The levels of rain, sleet, snow and driving wind we encountered were enough to force lesser cars toward the first exit ramp. Our Allroad, however, gave us the confidence to push on, safely arriving at our destination with a new respect for Audi’s luxury wagon. In everyday traffic, the Allroad rides a bit stiffer than one might expect, and its steering can feel vague at times. And, while Audi doesn’t advise taking the Allroad off-road, we’re fairly confident the 7.1 inches of ground clearance and quattro all-wheel drive can safely tackle sandy desert washes and snow-covered logging roads.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Audi Allroad wagon may not look as roomy as the Q5 SUV, but an additional 3.5 inches in length give it similar cargo volume at 27 (Allroad) vs. 29 cubic feet. With the rear seats folded, the difference grows to 50 vs. 57 cubic feet. The Allroad does, however, give up a couple inches in rear legroom to the Q5, which is something to consider if you regularly transport adults in back. Moving to the front seats, the Audi Allroad offers the same magic mix of materials, quality and design that keeps Audi interiors at the top of the rankings.
Exterior StylingLike Samson drawing power from his long locks, Audi’s 2016 Allroad sports wagon also derives much of its strength from an aesthetic source: contrasting, matte-finish wheel arches. Yeah, there are the raised ride height and stainless-steel skidplates, but the arches are the Allroad’s black turtleneck. Of course, Audi will gladly paint the whole car one color – but only if you give them another $1,000 (and only on silver, black and white models).
Favorite FeaturesAUDI CONNECT W/GOOGLE MAPSAlthough it requires a monthly subscription fee, we think the Google maps Street View image is one the best toys in the Audi connect toy box. Owners can also program the navigation route from a home computer, use voice commands to enter a destination and connect up to eight Wi-Fi devices.
BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIOAs part of the $4,000 Technology package, the 505-watt, 14-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system doesn’t come cheap (it was an $850 stand-alone option last year), but for audiophiles, it’s well worth it.
Standard FeaturesIn addition to leather seating and other luxury basics, Audi’s Allroad wagon for 2016 includes a panoramic sunroof, HID headlights with LED running lights, heated front seats and a 6.5-inch color screen with audio/climate/vehicle controls. Also onboard are Bluetooth prep, 3-zone climate control, a power rear liftgate and Audi’s music interface that allows accessing music from an iPod or iPhone and control of said device via the car’s audio system.
Factory OptionsA loaded 2016 Audi Allroad runs close to $60,000 and includes the world-class infotainment suite detailed in our Favorite Features section of this review, plus an impressive set of driver-assistance and personalization technologies, including side-assist blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control and navigation with Audi connect. Other options of note include Advanced Key keyless entry with push-button start, Bluetooth for streaming audio, sport front seats, rear-side airbags and the Bang & Olufsen audio upgrade.
Engine & TransmissionOther than unremarkable fuel economy, we like everything about the Allroad’s familiar powertrain. The renowned 2.0T engine is matched with a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic routing power to all four wheels via Quattro AWD. Audi says the 3,900-pound Allroad will scoot to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, which is quicker than we might have guessed based on our initial drives. On one hand, those drives took place at altitude, where thinner air can affect power output. On the other hand, turbocharged engines take less of a hit at altitude. Curiously and disappointingly, the Allroad’s rated fuel economy is almost identical as the heavier (by 200 pounds) and taller (by seven inches) Audi Q5 crossover. Top speed is electronically limited to 130 mph.

For the non-SUV driver who still needs the kind of capability and capacity only an SUV can provide, there’s the 2016 Audi Allroad luxury wagon. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the Allroad is endowed with additional ground clearance and protective cladding that permit it to venture lightly off-road. In terms of luxury, the Allroad outshines the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Subaru Outback Limited, although it also costs substantially more. The Allroad’s trump card is its ability to mimic luxury-car ride, handling and interior ambiance in a package that doesn’t feel bulky or claustrophobic. Unfortunately, the Allroad offers only one engine option that is not as fuel-efficient as the Q5’s diesel or as powerful as the V6-powered Cadillac XT5 or Infiniti QX50.

Driving the Used 2019 Toyota Tacoma Access CabFor most drivers, the 159-horsepower 2.7-liter engine can get the job done, but don’t look for stellar passing power when towing or climbing steep grades. While at first glance fuel-economy figures may seem attractive, they’re not all that much better than what the V6 delivers, leading us to suggest that if you can afford the extra cost, the V6 is the best choice. With 278 horsepower on tap, the 3.5-liter V6 moves the Tacoma with brisk bursts of acceleration and also enables it to tow up to 6,800 pounds. The 6-speed automatic is an older design, but it gets the job done; however, the 6-speed manual would still be our choice over the automatic. Seating is comfortable, and the cabin logically arranged with all the most important switchgear within easy reach. The Tacoma’s ride is firm but not jarring, and the steering is impressively responsive. We do think the Tacoma’s steering-wheel-and-pedal placement may prove challenging for drivers with long legs, but otherwise we have no gripes with the cabin layout.
Interior ComfortAs is Toyota’s tradition, assembly quality is excellent. The 2019 Tacoma interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting. It gets push-button start, and the handy multi-information display (between the main gauges) shows fuel economy, outside temperature and even off-road info such as trail mode or angle of the Tacoma on a steep hill. The new Tacoma also comes with the latest Entune system, the connectivity and entertainment-control center, and Qi wireless charging. However, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available on any model. Neither are power seats.
Exterior StylingNow in its third generation, the Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015 and it still looks fresh. Designed and built in the United States, the 2019 Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old-school. There are modern cues, such as LED daytime running lights, and the separate models — SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-road, TRD Pro and Limited — each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.
Favorite FeaturesTOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P

The Pro comes standard with unique hardware like Fox off-road shocks, a quarter-inch-thick aluminum skidplate, electronically locking rear differential, 5-mode Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control plus more ground clearance than the Chevy Colorado ZR2.
Standard FeaturesFor 2019 the Tacoma offers Toyota Safety Sense electronic driver aids as standard equipment. It includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. A rearview camera, a basic version of Entune connectivity, an automatic limited-slip differential, eight airbags, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a lockable tailgate, 16-inch wheels and adjustable tie-down cleats in the bed are also standard. The standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the rear wheels. Interestingly, the Tacoma uses old-school drum brakes in the rear, and power seats are not available, even in high-end models. On the other hand, the standard GoPro camera mount is as 21st-century as it gets.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2019 Toyota Tacoma roughly divide into features that make it more rugged and tough, and those that bump up technology and refinement. There’s the TRD Pro trim level, of course, but beyond that on the tough-truck side of the list are Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control, and a hard tonneau cover. On the technology side the Tacoma offers rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Making life more comfortable are push-button start with Smart Key, Qi wireless charging, tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated leather seats, Entune with a full app suite, and a JBL sound system. New this year is the TRD Pro Desert Air Intake for keeping fresh air flowing to the engine when churning up dust and sand.
Engine & TransmissionPower for the 2019 Toyota Tacoma comes from two sources. Standard is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine good for a modest 159 horsepower. Power can be routed to the rear wheels (2WD) or all four (4WD) but only via a 6-speed automatic transmission. A better choice is the 3.5-liter V6 that offers nearly 120 more horses and a significant boost in torque, yet delivers nearly identical fuel economy figures as the smaller 4-cylinder. You’ll also get a choice between the 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmission.

With the arrival of the new Ford Ranger and ever-expanding Chevy Colorado lineup, the aging 2019 Toyota Tacoma is feeling the pressure. However, that doesn’t seem to be slowing sales of America’s favorite midsize pickup. With over 30 configurations, Toyota builds a Tacoma for just about every need, and although it doesn’t offer the latest in infotainment or engine options, the Tacoma still has the muscle and capability to handle tough jobs. The TRD Pro appeals to those who like to get far off-road, while the base model with its frugal 4-cylinder engine is an affordable and economical small truck. And of course there’s the Tacoma’s legendary reputation for longevity, durability and reliability, not to mention stellar resale numbers.

OK, so what’s next? I’m interested in the newest version of this car. What’s for sale near me?I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.Then again, maybe I should be thinking about a used car.
Driving the Used 2019 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabChevy delivered a big surprise when it brought back the Colorado a few years back. It wasn’t just the fact that it reentered a market segment many wrote off for dead but just how good a job its designers and engineers pulled off. The 2019 pickup continues to impress. The Colorado features a solid and well-planted ride, with good performance even when carrying a full load in the cargo bed. The 2.8-liter Duramax diesel is a particularly good choice both for those hauling a trailer and for buyers looking for great mileage. The ZR2, meanwhile, offers a well-engineered alternative to the Toyota Tacoma if you’re into off-roading.
Interior ComfortWhile not quite as roomy or plush as comparable versions of the bigger Silverado, the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado offers a well-appointed cabin that goes well beyond the Spartan features you once expected from a midsize truck. The big updates for 2019, in fact, enhance the Colorado’s high-tech features, starting with its 3rd-generation infotainment system. Depending upon the trim level, it offers up to an 8-inch touch-screen display. That said, the cabin has the rugged feel of a truck that can stand up to serious work.
Exterior StylingUnlike the crossover-SUV-based Honda Ridgeline, the new Colorado retains its traditional body-on-frame bones and a classically rugged exterior design. That may be a little conservative for some buyers, but it reinforces the rugged capabilities of this midsize truck. That’s especially true of the ZR2, which is designed to go rock-crawling over the weekend and then take you to your office on Monday. The off-road edition features a raised suspension, a wider track, revised bumpers and a functional skidplate.
Favorite FeaturesDURAMAX DIESELThe Chevrolet Colorado (and its sibling, the GMC Canyon) is the only midsize truck available with a diesel engine, and the 2.8-liter Duramax is a prize. Smooth and powerful, it offers a first-rate driving experience along with superior fuel economy. A Smart diesel exhaust brake enhances control while reducing brake wear.
COLORADO ZR2Chevrolet pulled no punches introducing the 2018 Colorado ZR2; it continues for 2019 with serious off-road equipment including Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and additional skidplates under valuable components.
Standard FeaturesChevy has come up with a version of the Colorado for just about every taste, need and budget. Even the base model offers some welcome features, such as the CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate and cargo-box lighting. The mainstream LT trim adds an 8-inch touch screen for the updated 2019 model’s gen-3 infotainment system, with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio, as well as rear park assist. The ZR2 off-roader adds tow hooks, an off-road suspension package and skidplates.
Factory OptionsThe base 2019 Chevy Colorado features a 2.5-liter inline-4 engine. There are two optional powertrain packages: a 3.6-liter V-6 and the stump-pulling Duramax diesel. Like most trucks, Chevy also offers a wide range of body styles. That includes a crew cab, as well as standard and extended-length beds. You can add features like a spray-in bedliner, fog lights, cargo-bed storage rails, as well as all-wheel drive and a low-speed transfer case. The Z71 adds some off-road features, and the ZR2 takes you to rock-crawling extremes.
Engine & TransmissionWhere most midsize pickups offer a minimal choice of powertrain alternatives — if any choice at all — Chevy has three different packages, starting with the base 2.5-liter four, as well as a 3.6-liter V6 and the muscular 2.8-liter turbodiesel-4 that not only offers the truck’s best towing numbers, but also delivers its best fuel economy, at up to 30 mpg in rear-wheel-drive configuration. Depending on the model, the 2019 Chevy Colorado is available with either 2-wheel (rear) or 4-wheel drive (2WD, 4WD), and the Z71 and ZR2 models beef up off-road capabilities. A low-range gearbox is also on the option list.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Chevy Colorado helped mark the bow-tie brand’s 100th anniversary in 2018, so this year’s truck sees more modest updates, including the addition of some new exterior color and wheel options, as well as upgrades to its infotainment system. There are new power seats on upper-trim levels, and a new Rear Park Assist system.
Few recent vehicles have done more to change the market than the Chevrolet Colorado, which proved there’s real life left in the midsize-pickup segment. For many buyers, the Colorado offers all the interior space and cargo and towing capacity they need, while adding plenty of great features, good performance and handling and a reasonable price tag. Chevy has broadened the Colorado’s appeal by adding new variants, including both a diesel model and the rugged, off-road-oriented ZR2. The 2019 Colorado gets a number of small but welcome updates to enhance its appeal.

Antiquated safety and infotainment",33795,"The GMC Savana, the mechanical twin of the Chevrolet Express, is a full-size body-on-frame van. Available as a Passenger Van or a Cargo Van, the Savana has been around since 1996, and it looks much the same as it did back then.
No problem, really. With vans, it’s more about what they do than how they appear. And the Savana does a lot, whether it’s a Cargo Van schlepping tools and materials to the job site or a Passenger Van hauling a large family to, say, the Grand Canyon.
The Savana comes with a 135- or a 155-inch wheelbase, and overall lengths of 224 and 244 inches. The standard-length Savana Passenger Van seats 12 in four rows. The extended Savana seats 12 in four rows or 15 in five.
As a Cargo Van, the standard-length Savana has 124.6 inches of load floor behind its front seats, along with 239.7 cubic feet of cargo volume. In the Extended Savana Cargo Van, there’s 146.2 inches of load floor with an impressive 284.4 cubic feet of total cargo volume.
Three engines are available in the Savana. The base powerplant continues to be the long-lived 4.3-liter V6, which sends 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission.
Significantly better and stronger is GMC’s new heavy-duty 6.6-liter V8. With variable valve timing and a forged crankshaft, this iron-block engine produces 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque. That’s 11 percent more horsepower and 21 percent more peak torque than the 6.0-liter V8 it replaces. It teams with a heavy-duty 6-speed automatic.
Also available is a 2.8-liter turbodiesel inline-4. Although it puts out only 181 horsepower, the diesel sends a substantial 369 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels via an 8-speed automatic.
Always check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your are paying for their 2021 GMC Savana.
 2021 GMC Savana 1500 Cargo PricingA 2021 GMC Savana Cargo Van equipped with the 4.3-liter V6 starts at $33,795. That same van fitted with the new 6.6-liter V8 is $35,565. A diesel Savana Cargo Van starts at $37,865.
With an extended wheelbase, the Savana Cargo Van with the V6 starts at $35,695. Fully loaded and powered by the diesel engine, the extended Cargo Van can reach about $45,000.
The Savana Passenger Vans are a little pricier. The 2021 GMC Savana Passenger Van with standard wheelbase and 4.3-liter V6 starts at $37,695. With the 6.6-liter V8, it’s $39,390. A diesel GMC Savana Passenger Van starts at $41,690.
With the extended wheelbase, the 2021 GMC Savana Passenger Van starts at $39,695 with the V6, $41,390 with the V8, and $43,690 with the diesel. Fully loaded, a 15-passenger Savana with the V8 or diesel approaches $50,000.
The destination fee for all 2021 GMC Savana models is $1,295.
Competitors for the 2021 GMC Savana, which is built in Wentzville, Missouri, include the Ford Transit, the Ram ProMaster, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, the soon-to-be-discontinued Nissan NV, and even its Chevrolet Express corporate cousin.
Driving the  2021 GMC Savana 1500 CargoAlthough it’s an old-school truck-based van with an engine beneath a doghouse-style cover below the dash, the GMC Savana has remarkably pleasant driving manners. The view through the windshield is excellent, and the steering offers a good feel with a natural level of assist.
All three of GMC’s available engines put out good low-end torque, so they feel relatively relaxed while moving the big Savana about town, aided by the smooth-shifting 8- or 6-speed automatic gearboxes.
While it may feel like you’ve stepped back a decade when you climb into the Savana, it can be equipped with available modern touches such as a blind-spot monitor and a forward-collision-avoidance warning. Unfortunately, the GMC van does not have automatic emergency braking, and its rear passengers don’t get the safety-enhancing head restraints found on most of its competitors.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not provide fuel economy figures for big vans like the GMC Savana. We do know that the Savana has a large 31-gallon fuel tank, so it can go a long way between fill-ups. What’s more, the V6 and V8 run just fine on regular 87-octane gasoline.
Interior ComfortThe GMC Savana Cargo Van basically is an empty shell waiting for whatever shelving or racks the buyer seeks to install. It’s also available with an optional rear bench for three.
As a Passenger Van, the standard-wheelbase Savana in 2500 (three-quarter-ton) and 3500 (one-ton) forms seats 12 in a 2-3-3-4 arrangement. With the extended wheelbase, the Savana 3500 seats 12 (2-3-3-4) or 15 (2-3-3-3-4). The Max payload for the Savana 3500 is 4,503 pounds.
Rear air conditioning is available in the Savana, as is an auxiliary heater and a WiFi hotspot that provides an internet connection for up to seven devices at a distance of up to 50 feet.
Exterior StylingThe 2021 GMC Savana Cargo Van is available in four colors: Summit White, Onyx Black, Cardinal Red, and Quicksilver Metallic, the last a $495 option.
Chrome front and rear bumpers also are an option, as are white-painted wheels and heated rearview mirrors with black housings.
Favorite FeaturesTHE 6.6-LITER V8
This is a new engine in the GMC Savana. An iron-block pushrod V8, the 6.6 puts out 11 percent more horsepower and 21 percent more peak torque than the 6.0-liter V8 it replaces. It’s the engine you want in your Savana if you plan to do any serious towing.
5-PASSENGER CARGO VAN
You can order your Savana Cargo Van with a rear bench seat for 3, enabling you to take your small crew with you to the job site. Be warned, however: When you get this $1,965 option, the Savana’s six D-ring cargo tie-down anchors are removed.
Standard FeaturesStandard features on the 2021 GMC Savana Cargo Van include the 4.3-liter V6 and 8-speed automatic transmission, plus high-back bucket seats with armrests, power windows, air conditioning, swing-out passenger-side doors, an AM/FM stereo, and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the two front seats.
The Savana Passenger Van has the same V6 powertrain, and it comes standard with 12-passenger vinyl seating and air conditioning. It also has 16-inch wheels, a 3.42:1 rear-axle ratio, and the same basic AM/FM stereo with an MP3 player.
Factory OptionsOptions abound on the 2021 GMC Savana Cargo Van. Both the 6.6-liter V8 and the 2.8-liter turbodiesel are optional, as is Quicksilver Metallic paint.
Almost all options on the Savana Cargo Van come in packages. Two of the most notable are the $3,105 Safety Package (the 6.6-liter V8, blind-spot monitor, rear park assist, heated side-view mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, OnStar) and a $3,055 Enhanced Convenience Package (that doesn’t have heated side mirrors but does include keyless entry and remote start).
There’s also a simple Driver Convenience Package on the Savana; it combines cruise control and a tilt steering wheel for a reasonable $395.
The 2021 GMC Savana Passenger Van also is available in Quicksilver Metallic, and you can order it with upgraded cloth seat upholstery for $255.
Similarly, the Passenger Van is available with the same $3,105 Safety Package, as well as the same $3,055 Enhanced Safety Package and $395 Driver Convenience Package.
Stand-alone options on both Savanas include a heavy-duty second battery ($225), a 220-amp alternator ($75), a locking rear differential ($325), a heavy-duty towing kit ($280), and a sliding passenger-side door ($195). Rear park assist is also available for $295.
Stand-alone safety options on the 2021 GMC Savana include a blind-spot monitor ($395) and Forward-Collision Alert ($295). And if you want your extended-wheelbase Savana Passenger Van to have 15 seats instead of the standard 12, that’s an extra $475.
We’re also happy to report that both 2021 GMC Savanas are available with an upgraded AM/FM stereo that includes a USB port and a CD player. Don’t throw away your old CDs!
Engine & TransmissionThree engines are available in the 2021 GMC Savana.
The base powerplant is GM’s trusty 4.3-liter V6, which produces 276 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 298 lb-ft of torque at 3,900 rpm. This engine gets the job done with minimal fuss, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.
In the most significant Savana news for 2021, GMC has replaced last year’s 6.0-liter V8 with an all-new heavy-duty 6.6-liter V8 developed specifically for trucks. This iron-block engine – with a forged crankshaft and fuel-saving cylinder deactivation – produces 401 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 464 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm. Max tow capacity with this new 6.6-liter V8, which is teamed with a heavy-duty 6-speed automatic transmission, is an impressive 10,000 pounds.
Continuing to be available on both GMC Savana models is the 2.8-liter inline-4 turbodiesel, which mates to the 8-speed automatic transmission. This engine produces 181 horsepower at 3,400 rpm and a substantial 369 lb-ft of torque at only 2,000 rpm.
The EPA doesn’t provide fuel economy data for these large GMC vans. If you’re looking to squeak out some extra fuel economy out of your Savana, the diesel looks like your best choice.
All GMC Savana models are rear-wheel drive. If you need all-wheel drive (AWD), look to the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.

And if four doors are preferable to two, then definitely locate the nearest Mini dealership. Although the Beetle’s 174 horsepower is stronger than the entry-level Mini’s 134 horsepower, the latter enjoys better fuel consumption (38-mpg highway).
What's New?Trim levels for the 2019 VW Beetle are S, SE, Final Edition SE and Final Edition SEL, with equipment distributed more generously toward the higher end.
The 2019 Volkswagen Beetle enters its last year of production. All good things, etc. Over the course of its existence, the Beetle — available in coupe and convertible form — has been one of the few cars that transcend mere personal transportation to become a statement. Although it started out mimicking the looks of the original Beetle (the archetypal “people’s car”), this version has made its own impact on motoring society. Which might be a long-winded way of saying that it’s cute and it’s fun. The retro styling mixes with modern features and safety equipment to form a desirable combination. Now VW is closing this chapter in its story, but the Beetle is going out on a high note, with decent equipment levels and a punchy engine.
Used 2019 Volkswagen Beetle PricingThe 2019 Volkswagen Beetle S coupe launches the range with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $20,895. Add the destination charge of $895 and that makes $21,790. The SE trim starts at $25,290. The Final Edition SE model represents better value, starting at $24,040. And the Final Edition SEL coupe comes in at $26,890. The convertible models are priced at $26,890 (S), $29,290 (SE), $28,190 (Final Edition SE) and $30,890 (Final Edition SEL). For some context, the 2-door Mini Cooper hatchback starts at $22,750. The Fiat 500 subcompact hatch is priced from a more affordable $17,540, but its limited appeal means we’re less likely to recommend it to as many people. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area for their new VW Beetle. Keep in mind that resale values are not especially strong.
Driving the Used 2019 Volkswagen BeetleAlthough it’s no enthusiast’s dream, the 2019 Beetle has tidy handling that’s more comfortable than rivals like the Mini Cooper and Fiat 500, with a smoother ride quality and less noise on the freeway. The Beetle feels stable rather than nimble. The 174-horsepower turbocharged engine is satisfying, providing strong acceleration and reassuring passing power. It’s well-matched to the 6-speed automatic transmission, which has a Sport mode for more aggressive response, and a manual mode for those who like to get more involved. Outward vision is generally good, although rear-three-quarter vision is compromised in the convertible, both when the fabric roof is up and down.
Interior ComfortUp front, the VW Beetle sports bucket seats that are well-shaped and supportive, while space is exceptionally generous. A couple of passengers can fit in the back, but the smaller they are, the better. Overall, the interior design is clean and simple, with a blend of modern and retro touches. There are several stowage places for phones and the like, plus a double glove box. Coupe models are basically hatchbacks and a surprising amount of luggage area sits behind the rear seats: 15.4 cubic feet. There’s only 7.1 cubic feet in the convertible’s trunk and accessing that space is awkward.
Exterior StylingThe VW Beetle pays homage to the VW Beetle. In other words, the current model was inspired by the old classic. As such, its profile is one of the most recognizable car shapes ever. The curved hood, curved fenders, curved roof, round headlights and short overhangs at each end evoke Volkswagen’s cool pedigree. The convertible’s power-operated roof doesn’t fold completely into the body (as so many modern convertibles do), so the general effect is now unintentionally retro. But still quite pleasant in its way.
Favorite FeaturesFENDER PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEMOne of the strongest audio systems in this class, the VW Beetle’s optional Fender-branded premium audio system sends 400 watts through four speakers, four tweeters and a subwoofer in the trunk. Fender is renowned for its electric guitars and amplifiers, and this system is made in collaboration with Panasonic.
DRIVER-ASSISTANCE TECHNOLOGYEven the entry-level 2019 Beetle S trim has blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. It also has VW’s Intelligent Crash Response System that cuts the engine’s fuel supply, unlocks the doors and activates the hazard lights in the event of an airbag deployment. Plus, automatic post-collision braking to avoid secondary impacts after an accident.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Beetle range begins with the S trim, which has 16-inch alloy wheels, 5-inch infotainment touch screen, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cloth upholstery, and an 8-speaker audio system that includes AM/FM radio, CD player, Bluetooth, USB port and an auxiliary input. It has the aforementioned safety features as well. SE models improve matters with rain-sensing wipers, heated washer nozzles, 17-inch alloys, keyless entry/ignition, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, 6.3-inch touch screen, and ambient cabin lighting. A Final Edition SE brings stainless-steel pedals and cloth/simulated-leather seating surfaces. This trim is cheaper than the regular SE, but still enjoys much of the same equipment. The Final Edition SEL has 18-inch alloys, leather upholstery, Fender audio and parking sensors.
Factory OptionsFinal Edition versions of the 2019 VW Beetle aren’t really eligible for many options; the top model already has pretty much everything as standard. It’s the regular SE that offers the most extras, such as bigger wheels, bi-xenon headlights with LED daytime running lights and taillights, navigation, parking sensors front and rear, and the Fender-branded audio system.
Engine & TransmissionEvery 2019 Beetle is propelled by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine developing 174 horsepower. That’s sufficient muscle for most purposes. Highway cruising and city zipping are equally well served, especially in conjunction with the 6-speed automatic transmission and its Sport mode. Many turbocharged engines require premium fuel, but this unit is happy enough with regular. And fuel consumption (29 mpg combined) is unaffected by body style. Front-wheel drive is the only setup; there’s no option for all-wheel drive.

Driving the Used 2019 Chevrolet TraverseThe biggest crossover SUV in Chevy’s lineup is no longer a 3-row also-ran. It has more than enough power to keep you moving, even on steep hills, thanks to a gutsy, 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 — and the fact that the new model is about 350 pounds lighter than the previous-generation Traverse. The engine is paired to a smooth-shifting 9-speed automatic that always seems to find the right gear. Downshifts come quickly and smoothly, making for easy freeway entrances and high-speed passes. Chevy offers an alternative on the 2019 Traverse RS trim, a peppy, torquey turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4. The downside, especially for those in snowy climes, is that the turbo-4 is offered only in front-wheel drive. What’s particularly impressive about the Chevy Traverse is the way it maintains its poise on rough roads without leaning over while cornering. Credit a well-tuned electric power-assist steering system that offers just the right amount of road feel. It’s no sports car, but it maintains great poise for a family-hauler.
Interior ComfortOffering good visibility, the 2019 Chevy Traverse features a relatively flat roofline that ensures plenty of headroom for passengers in the second and third rows. Better yet, the back row is no longer a penalty box for adults. The new instrument cluster with its big infotainment screen is a step up. Pull the Chevy badges off and you might mistake the new Traverse for a more upscale brand. Adding to the ease of a long-distance trip: a 10-speaker Bose sound system, the latest infotainment technology Chevy offers, including an onboard 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and such features as active cruise control.
Exterior StylingAlthough a bit more modern and graceful, the latest-generation Chevy Traverse retains a more classic ute-like appearance than many of its competitors. The nose is slightly more raked, reflecting some of the steps taken to improve aerodynamics. There’s a more attractive grille, split by a crossbar emblazoned with the classic Chevrolet bow-tie logo. Our test vehicle was one of the new High Country models, which features tastefully selective chrome accents, including strips on the otherwise body-color side-mirror caps. What you might not notice is that the wheelbase has been stretched by two inches, key to giving lots more room to passengers and cargo.
Favorite FeaturesSMARTSLIDE 2nd-ROW SEAT
The SmartSlide 2nd-row seat makes getting to the third row a snap. No, it’s still not as easy as getting in and out of a minivan, but then again, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
HIDDEN STORAGE
Chevy’s Traverse offers a cool little hidden storage compartment behind the infotainment screen, with a twist: The screen keeps working even if it’s open, and you can lock the whole thing with a PIN if you like. There’s also a massive hidden compartment under the cargo floor that’s the same size in front- and all-wheel-drive models.
Standard FeaturesAvailable only in front-wheel drive, the base 2019 Chevrolet Traverse L model is reasonably well-equipped, with such niceties as six USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on the 7-inch Chevy MyLink touch screen, a rearview camera, Teen Driver monitoring tech, keyless ignition, and even a traction mode selection. You’ll find plenty more features as you step up…and up to the top-line High Country model introduced in 2018. There you’ll find standard features like an electronic parking aid and a 360-degree surround-view parking camera.
Factory OptionsChevy Traverse LS, LT, Premier and High Country models can all be ordered with all-wheel drive. Beyond that, LS models get tinted glass and a wider color palette. LT models with a cloth interior add nicer wheels, fog lights and roof rails. Order an LT model with leather, and you’ll also get a surround-view camera, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alerts, parking assist, and an upgraded infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen. In addition to its small turbocharged engine, RS models add a power tailgate, Bose audio system and navigation. Premier and High Country models include LED headlights, memory seats, hands-free rear tailgate, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and heated and cooled front seats. The High Country also adds a dual-clutch rear differential, adaptive cruise control, and remote start.
Engine & TransmissionWhile many vehicles in this segment are offered with just a single powertrain choice, Chevy opted to deliver two, including the peppy turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Traverse RS. The 2.0-liter model actually sacrifices 1 mpg on the highway but more than makes up for it with a 2-mpg gain around town. It also boasts better torque than the 3.6-liter V6 alternative. It’s only available in front-drive (FWD), however, so those who want all-wheel drive (AWD) will go for the bigger-displacement package. The V6 also bumps towing capacity up from 1,500 to 5,000 pounds. That engine is paired with a smooth-shifting new 9-speed automatic. For maximum traction, consider the Traverse High Country, which adds a dual-clutch transfer system, rather than the single-clutch unit on other AWD models.

Silver-painted aluminum wheels on certain models
Chevrolet is making major changes to its SUV lineup and one of the most significant updates brought an all-new version of the Traverse to market last year. The new version delivered an array of welcome changes, growing more spacious — with room for up to eight and plenty of cargo — even while shedding 350 pounds. It’s markedly better-looking than the outgoing model, inside and out, and offers both more features and more power. Chevy also introduced a new high-line version in the form of the Traverse High Country. Available in standard front-wheel drive and optional all-wheel drive, the Chevrolet Traverse is finally up to taking on a competitive set that includes such stalwarts as the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, Volkswagen Atlas and other crossover SUVs.

Its impressive track skills are backed by impeccable everyday manners and luxury credentials.","ConsBrand loyalties aside, the new M5, at $103,695 (including $995 destination), is a pricey proposition. And consider this: An M550i (reviewed separately) costs about $30,000 less, and this top model in the standard BMW 5 Series lineup packs a V8 punch.",103695,"What's New?The BMW M5 Competition ($110,995) is a new model for 2019. In addition to its 617-horsepower V8, this hyper-sporty M5 benefits from a more aggressively tuned chassis, firmer engine mounts, and lightweight forged wheels. Also, Apple CarPlay has been made standard in all 2019 BMW M5s.
The 2019 BMW M5 proves there’s still plenty of life for high-performance sedans, thanks largely to a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 that makes a nice even 600 horsepower. Aided by standard all-wheel drive, this 6th-generation Bavarian super-sedan puts the power down with composure as it streaks to 60 mph in a scant 3.2 seconds and reach an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. Of note: For serious drivers seeking serious thrills, the M5 can be switched into a rear-drive-only mode that allows burnouts and other shenanigans. Topping that is the new 2019 BMW M5 Competition — with its aggressively tuned suspension, firmer engine mounts and 617-horsepower V8, the new M5 Competition is the most powerful M5 model ever sold by BMW. Its top speed: 189 mph.
Used 2019 BMW M5 PricingThe 2019 BMW M5 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $103,695, including a destination charge of $995 and a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. The new 2019 BMW M5 Competition starts at $111,995, destination and gas-guzzler also included. How does this pricing compare to that of the M5’s natural foe, the Mercedes-AMG E63 S? Well, that hot Mercedes-AMG, powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 with 603 horsepower, starts at about $105,000, making these potent Germans remarkably similarly priced. Before ordering your 2019 BMW M5, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As the M5 was new for 2018, it’s too early to predict its resale value.
Driving the Used 2019 BMW M5The M5 is ferocious. On Portugal’s famed Estoril racetrack, which formerly hosted F1 races, we felt the M magic firsthand. The M-finessed all-wheel-drive system lets the M5 hit 60 mph in only 3.2 seconds, with all four wheels grappling the pavement and giving this big German sedan a sublime composure. In corners, the M5 hangs on better than any 2-ton midsize sedan rightfully should. It just sticks. This is in standard “4WD” (4-wheel-drive) mode. In “4WD Sport,” the system allows the M5 to slide around a bit more. In “2WD” (2-wheel-drive) mode, all power is sent to the rear wheels, as in all previous generations of M5. This disables traction control, allowing expert drivers to drift the M5 with skill. When not at the track, the 2019 BMW M5 drives like, well, a top-line 5 Series. Whereas past M5s could be rather beastly in city and suburbs, this one feels plush and serene when its driver-adjustable settings are tailored for comfort. We also like the 8-speed automatic transmission, which was new in 2018 and is far more refined than the 7-speed twin-clutch automatic used just a couple of years ago. If there’s anything the new M5 is missing when compared to past models, it’s a manual transmission. Not enough buyers were choosing it, says BMW.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 M5’s interior is like that of the standard 5 Series, but with everything taken up a notch in quality. The transmission selector, for example, one of the first things you’ll touch, is nubbier than the pistol grip of the standard model, and in the M5 it’s surrounded by additional buttons to help tailor how the vehicle drives. As it’s more of a toggle than a standard mechanism that moves up and down on a track, the selector can be a little awkward at first use. Also notable are two red buttons on the M5 that peer from on top of the steering wheel like little ears. Labeled M1 and M2, they enable you to call up two customized driving setups tailored to your preference for everything from steering feel and dampers to the xDrive setup.
Exterior StylingAs it does with its interior, the M5 retains the basic shape of its lesser 5 Series siblings, but with specific M touches for better performance. The M5’s track and overall width are slightly wider than those of the standard 5 Series sedan, while overall height is a touch higher. The roof of this high-performance BMW 5 Series sedan is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic to cut weight, and it also possesses a unique front apron with enlarged air intakes and standard 19-inch wheels. Another M5 giveaway? The quad exhaust outlets in back.
Favorite FeaturesM XDRIVE ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE SYSTEM In this arrangement, the front wheels are powered only when the rear wheels aren’t able to transmit any more torque to the road and additional traction is needed. Even in their default settings, the stability control and 4WD allow a certain amount of slip at the rear wheels, preserving the M5’s traditional rear-drive feel.
 BOWERS & WILKINS AUDIO SYSTEM This optional audio system — all 16 speakers and 1,400 watts of it — is among the finest we’ve heard in a car. In fact, we wrote an entire Audio Road Test review of it from our last time in a 2018 BMW 5 Series.
Standard FeaturesAs you’d expect of the top BMW 5 Series, the M5 is well equipped. In addition to all its performance upgrades, you’ll get 20-way-power front seats, extended Merino leather upholstery, head-up display, power-operated trunk, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and steering wheel, and universal garage remote. Safety features include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and frontal-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The M5 Competition, of note, comes with a special M Sport exhaust system that produces “an extremely distinctive sound with a sportier tone — especially when the engine is pushed hard and at high revs.”
Factory OptionsThe Driving Assist Plus package adds driving and safety aids like active cruise control (with Stop & Go), active lane-keeping assist and what BMW calls Traffic Jam Assistant. The Executive Package adds an extra dollop of luxury, courtesy of soft-close automatic doors, massaging front seats, wireless charging, and a surround-view camera with a 3D view. Executive includes heated rear seats too. If you order the M Driver’s Package, you can take your M5 to a course at a BMW Performance Center, and have its top speed raised to 189 mph. Individual options include the Bowers & Wilkins audio system, night vision, a moonroof, and carbon-ceramic brakes.
Engine & TransmissionThe twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 in the 2019 BMW M5 makes 600 horsepower. In the new BMW M5 Competition, the same basic V8 makes 617 horsepower, thanks to tuning tweaks and a less restrictive M Sport exhaust system. All-wheel drive keeps the 2019 M5 composed in hard acceleration, a genuinely thrilling experience peppered by the crisp shifts of BMW’s excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. While we’re glad BMW lets the M5 be switched to a rear-wheel-drive setting via an M-specific system, do so with caution because the M5’s twin-turbo V8 can smoke the car’s rear tires at will. And as ironic as it may be, the Autobahn-slaying M5 is fitted with an engine start/stop feature that saves fuel by cutting engine power at idle. Be warned, the automatic restarts are abrupt, so we regularly deactivated the system via a button below the red push-button ignition. 4.4-liter turbocharged V8 600 horsepower @ 5,700-6,600 rpm 553 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-5,700 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15 mpg/21 mpg 4.4-liter turbocharged V8 617 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 553 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-5,860 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A

Driving the Used 2019 Jeep WranglerOur experience driving the Jeep Wrangler was in the wilds of New Zealand, where rocks and boulders, rushing water, and rutted and muddy fields put the new Wrangler to the test. At least in theory — the reality is that none of the varied terrain proved much of a challenge to the Jeep. The Tru-Lok front and rear locking differentials helped make short work of the slick stuff, and both the V6 and turbocharged 4-cylinder provided plenty of torque and power whenever we asked for it. If more wheel travel is required, the anti-roll bars can be electronically disconnected. Rubicon models also come with tubular rock rails in addition to the standard four skidplates for extra undercarriage protection. Yet that’s all expected from a Jeep — what really surprised us was the new Wrangler’s civility around town. The improved steering, 5-link suspension, improved body mounts, retuned shocks, and even the drivetrain have all been upgraded for an around-town experience that belies this SUV’s off-road ability.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Jeep Wrangler interior combines elements of modern, sophisticated design with a simple and clean layout that has been part of the Wrangler’s DNA for decades. Nestled in the body-colored dash panels are such 21st-century touches as a large touch-screen infotainment system and available Alpine audio system. Of course, the prerequisite grab handles are still here, as is the removable top and protective incorporated rollbars. Base models are a bit less fancy, but move up to the big-dollar trims and you’ll get heated seats and steering wheel, navigation and even a leather-wrapped dash. The Wrangler 4-door offers more rear-seat legroom courtesy of a longer wheelbase.
Exterior StylingAt first glance, the 2019 Wrangler’s styling is purely evolutionary. However, there’s a lot going on that you may not notice at first glance. The Wrangler is more than two inches wider and has more than two inches of additional wheelbase over the last generation, all in the name of stability and comfort. The doors are made of aluminum, making them easier to remove. Folding down the windshield only requires removing four bolts instead of 28 as in previous Wrangler models. LED headlights and taillights are available, and multiple roof configurations are also available, making it easier than ever to enjoy the open-top off-roading Jeepers want, but the kind of quick shelter from rain they need.
Favorite FeaturesTURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINE
A turbocharged 4-cylinder engine might not seem like a Jeep standard, but in this case the little engine provides more torque than the V6, but less horsepower. Fuel economy is better, too, as the only transmission choice is the 8-speed automatic.
UPGRADED INTERIOR
The Wrangler’s interior is far from the Spartan layouts of the early CJ and YJ Wranglers, offering luxury touches like leather seats and dash, Uconnect audio with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and more safety and convenience features such as forward-collision warning and adaptive cruise control.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model Wrangler Sport comes standard with the V6 and 6-speed manual transmission. It also comes standard with 4-wheel drive, in this case Jeep’s Command-Trac system. You also get standard fog lights, underbody skidplates, push-button ignition, and Jeep’s new Sunrider with its clever sunroof panel. What’s more noteworthy is what’s missing. Power windows, air conditioning, a touch-screen audio system and Bluetooth are only available as options or on higher trim levels. The Sport does come with an 8-speaker audio system though, with USB and AUX inputs. Wrangler 4-door models come with an extra set of doors, 5-passenger seating capacity, and additional rear-seat and luggage space.
Factory OptionsFactory options include your choice of an 8-speed automatic or 4-cylinder turbo engine in any model. The trim ladder goes up through Sport S, Sahara (4-door only) and Rubicon models, each with varying levels of equipment. The Sport S adds power windows, air conditioning and keyless entry; the 4-door’s Sahara model adds upgraded trim and allows buyers to select the more advanced Selec-Trac full-time transfer case. Rubicon models are the most off-road ready, with tubular rock rails and an even more advanced 4-wheel-drive system. Option packages include different hardtop configurations, an 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system, and blind-spot sensors.
Engine & TransmissionAlthough the promise of a diesel engine is still on the table, for now the 2019 Jeep Wrangler makes do with two gasoline engines. The first is the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 good for 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. This engine can be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. Optional is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine pumping out 268 horses and 295 lb-ft of torque, the latter delivered very low in the rev band. The 4-cylinder is offered on all trims, but only with the 8-speed automatic. Four-wheel-drive systems include the Command-Trac part-time 2-speed transfer case, Selec-Trac 2-speed transfer case with full-time 4-wheel drive and the Rubicon’s Rock-Trac 2-speed transfer case with 4.0:1 low-range gear, front and rear electric locking differentials and disconnecting front sway bar.

Advanced Safety Group now has adaptive cruise control
New paint color: Bikini (an aqua green)

The 2019 Jeep Wrangler is the latest iteration of the iconic Jeep rock-crawler, newly redesigned last year with more features, power, safety and off-road ability. Offered with a choice of two or four doors, the Wrangler delivers the kind of open-air, off-road adventuring no other vehicle can match. Despite its many improvements, the 2019 Wrangler sticks with traditional solid front and rear axles and a choice of 4-wheel-drive systems. However, unlike Wranglers of old, this one actually delivers a reasonably civilized ride over paved roads, with a cabin that is downright plush on some trims. As the Ford Bronco is still another year out, the Wrangler has no real competition outside some off-road-ready pickups, and that’s just how Jeep likes it.

We suspect the all-new Acura RDX will undercut the X3, too.",42000,"What's New?All-new just last year, for 2019 the BMW X3 introduces the lower-priced, rear-wheel-drive sDrive30i model. Newly standard is park-distance control and the Active Guard safety system with frontal-collision warning and automatic emergency braking.
The 2019 BMW X3 is one of the coolest kids in one of the coolest classes among cars: the compact-luxury-SUV segment. Here it competes for the hearts, minds and dollars of upwardly mobile buyers who may also be considering a Mercedes-Benz GLC or Lexus NX, or an Audi Q5 or Acura RDX. The BMW X3 stands apart from such rivals by the fact that it was among the first of its kind, the trendsetter of the segment. Beyond its aspirational badge and German pedigree, the 2019 X3 is a real-deal BMW. It touts the brand’s dynamic performance and fun-to-drive manners while also boasting the latest technology and a cadre of creature comforts. The BMW X3 is hardly the least expensive compact-luxury SUV, but it’s still among the most desired.
Used 2019 BMW X3 PricingThe cost of getting into a new 2019 BMW X3 just got a little easier thanks to the reintroduction of a rear-drive base model. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the X3 sDrive30i starts just under $42,000, while the all-wheel-drive xDrive30i starts closer to $44,000. The more powerful, 6-cylinder X3 M40i is a significant jump in price, starting over $55,000. With options, these prices can easily rise by over $10,000. At its base point, the 2019 X3 is roughly in line with rivals like the Mercedes-Benz GLC, Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60. Rivals with lower starting prices include the Infiniti QX50 and Lexus NX, while the Porsche Macan is several thousand higher. Before buying your luxury-crossover SUV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The BMW X3’s resale value is expected to be about mid-pack, trailing rivals like the Lexus NX, Audi Q5 and Porsche Macan.
Driving the Used 2019 BMW X3It may be a cliché by now, but it still rings true: The BMW X3 puts the “sport” in sport-utility vehicle. That’s to say, the company’s penchant for creating sedans that are dynamic, fun to drive and powerful has crossed over into its crossover SUVs. Even the least expensive X3 boasts surprisingly good acceleration and handling. It hits the 0-60-mph benchmark in six seconds flat. The BMW X3 is among the top performers in its class for agile handling, too, thanks to the rear-biased all-wheel-drive system (AWD). New for 2019 is the return of a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) variant. In addition to saving money, it will feel most akin to a traditional 3 Series sedan. The turbocharged 4-cylinder X3 has all the power that most buyers will need, but for those craving an extra helping, the X3 M40i heaps it on with a turbocharged 6-cylinder that enables this BMW to fly from 0-60 mph in just 4.6 seconds. Tied to either engine is a smooth and gratifying 8-speed automatic transmission. With the Driving Dynamics Control, you can tailor vehicle settings to your liking. For example, we found the steering too firm in the Sport+ mode, but the Individual option let us tone that down while still enabling more aggressive settings for the engine and throttle. If you plan to use this BMW SUV for off-pavement excursions, you can take comfort in knowing the new X3 acquitted itself nicely on deeply rutted roads, where its eight inches of ground clearance eased fear of scrapes.
Interior ComfortBMW’s X3 has the same design aesthetic as other recent vehicles from the German luxury brand. There’s a wide-view display mounted high on the dash, the iDrive control knob alongside BMW’s unique gear selector, and the same ergonomics of the BMW ownership experience for the past couple of decades. It leans more toward the minimalistic end, but there’s built-in premium feel to its simplicity. Controls for common functions like audio and climate are logical and easy to reach, but the iDrive circular controller for screen functions and even the pistol-like gearshift are best first studied at a standstill. The X3 is extraordinarily roomy inside, even for its compact class. The driver and front passenger have plenty of space, and most rear-seat passengers will find good legroom. Headroom is similarly plentiful, and the cargo space is near the top of the class in both usability and outright space. In addition to a flat-floor cargo area, there’s room for small items should you want to hide them beneath the floor.
Exterior StylingIf it seems even small cars today are bigger, it’s not your imagination. This new, 3rd-generation X3 is actually a little bigger than the first-generation BMW X5, which is technically a size bigger. But the X3 wears its volume well and doesn’t look oversized. The optional 20- or 21-inch wheels look great, and the wide stance imparts a sense of stability. We think the overall integration of headlights, grille and other elements feels more cohesive on this model than that of the previous generation. The same is true in the back, where the taillights flow cleanly into the tailgate. The X3 M40i wears more aggressive sheet metal, with deeper front and rear bumpers, body-color side-sill extensions, and more aggressive wheel-and-tire combinations.
Favorite FeaturesM40i The X3 M40i is the ideal solution if you’re stuck choosing between a sports sedan and an SUV. With plentiful power from its 6-cylinder engine, surprisingly good handling, sharp steering and excellent brakes, you’d think it was a sporty wagon. But it’s comfortable off pavement as well, something most sporty sedans can’t match.
 SPACE MANAGEMENT The 2019 BMW X3 manages its tidy dimensions admirably, offering ample interior space for front and rear passengers, and all their stuff in the cargo area. We particularly like the triple-split-folding rear seatbacks, which allow you to fold down the center section for long objects without having to sacrifice two seating positions.
Standard FeaturesOut the gate, the new base model X3 sDrive30i comes nicely equipped with power tailgate, 3-zone automatic climate control, 10-way-power front seats, SensaTec faux leather upholstery, rain-sensing windshield wipers, universal garage-door opener and, for 2019, standard parking sensors. Also new is the Active Guard system with frontal-collision warning and the Automatic City Collision Mitigation braking system, which can automatically apply the brakes if the vehicle senses an impending crash. The standard iDrive infotainment system bundles a 10.25-inch screen that can be controlled by touch or the iDrive dial, and a 12-speaker/205-watt AM/FM/HD Radio with USB input and Bluetooth streaming. Apple CarPlay integration is available, but it’s an extra $300. If you’re married to Android Auto, be aware that the X3 doesn’t support it at this time.
Factory OptionsThe X3 xDrive30i adds all-wheel drive (BMW calls it “xDrive”), and like the sDrive30i model offers three jumping off points: xLine, Luxury and M Sport. The Luxury line, for example, adds chrome trim, while the M Sport gives the standard model sporty-looking flair. While there are plenty of stand-alone options, BMW has grouped many of them into ""tiers."" The Convenience tier adds amenities like lumbar support, keyless entry, satellite radio and a panoramic sunroof. Premium adds a head-up display, navigation, Apple CarPlay, and heated steering wheel and seats. The Executive tier includes adaptive full LED headlights, digital instrument cluster, parking assistant, surround view with 3D view, and BMW’s Gesture Control. Besides a more powerful engine and other performance gear, the M40i takes a different approach, offering many of those features as stand-alone option packages. Note that both models offer leather as an option, not standard. Other options include the Driver Assistance Plus package that bundles adaptive cruise control, active lane-keeping assist and other active-safety features, while the Dynamic Handling package features dynamic damper control, M Sport brake and variable sport steering. Also in the offering are a premium harman/kardon audio system, wireless phone charger, and Wi-Fi hotspot.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available for the 2019 BMW X3, and neither is a bad call. The X3 sDrive30i and xDrive30i get a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder putting out 248 horsepower. This is an engine that’s been doing yeoman’s duty under the hoods of virtually every BMW out there these days, and if you choose it you’ll likely never feel shortchanged. With the new sDrive30i model, you can once again get a rear-wheel-drive X3. The xDrive of the others means they are all-wheel drive, a good choice if you live in cold-weather states or plan light off-roading. The upgrade engine in the X3 M40i is the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 that, again, finds itself under the hood of many other BMW vehicles. With power (355 horsepower) and torque (369 lb-ft) to spare, this engine hardly ever feels strained. Both come connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission, and both drive all four wheels. Fuel economy is better than many of its rivals, too. To help eke out more miles per gallon, the X3 uses a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle. If you’re not keen on the engine constantly switching off and on in traffic, it can be defeated with the press of a button.

Driving the Used 2019 Nissan PathfinderThis V6 is good. Moving off from a standstill or providing extra thrust for decisive overtaking, it never seems to come up short. Sending power to the front wheels (FWD) in standard form or the optional all-wheel-drive (AWD) system is a continuously variable transmission (CVT). These units don’t tend to find that many fans. They have a tendency to drone and be slow in their responses (the transmissions, not the fans). Still, Nissan uses them a lot and has engineered them to the point of making a fair impersonation of a regular automatic. In an all-wheel-drive 2019 Pathfinder, it includes a full-lock setting for rough or slippery surfaces, making the vehicle suitable for light off-roading adventures. In the usual urban and suburban environments, the ride is composed, yet not particularly smooth.
Interior ComfortWith seating for up to seven, the 3-row Nissan Pathfinder has plenty of space in the first two rows. But as is so often the case, the third row is best suited to younger, more flexible members of the family. The reclining 2nd-row seats can also slide, providing easier access to the back. Those up front will like the standard 8-inch infotainment touch screen and quickly get to grips with the controls. Ergonomics in general is well-thought-out, including a height-adjustable driver’s seat. Luggage space behind the third row is a useful 16 cubic feet, expanding to 47.8 behind the second. With both rows folded flat, maximum cargo area is 79.8, which is around average for the class.
Exterior StylingNissan, a company that doesn’t mind taking stylistic risks (Exhibit A: the Juke), sticks to unadventurous and conservative with its 2019 Pathfinder. That’s not a bad thing; there’s a better chance of having broader appeal. The proportions work well together, and the overall look shouldn’t be dated by the time an owner makes that final payment. The optional dual-pane moonroof brings an airiness to the whole cabin, while the gesture-controlled tailgate in the higher trim levels (wave a foot under the rear bumper) is exceptionally convenient.
Favorite FeaturesREAR-DOOR ALERTWe all forget things from time to time, like shopping, pets, dry cleaning, or even kids. There’s no judgment here. Nissan’s handy system takes note if a vehicle’s rear-passenger door was opened at the beginning of a trip, but not at its conclusion.
AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKINGMany new vehicles have this feature as standard. But it’s no less welcome because of that. Using a network of sensors, the Pathfinder reads the distance to the vehicle in front, gives audible and visual alerts if that distance is reducing rapidly, then applies the brakes if the driver hasn’t responded in time.
Standard FeaturesIn ascending order of equipment levels, the 2019 Nissan Pathfinder comes in S, SV, SL and Platinum trims. The S still enjoys that exuberant V6, 18-inch alloy wheels, 8-inch touch screen, push-button ignition, rear parking sensors, 3-zone climate control, four USB Type-A ports, two USB Type-C ports, 6-speaker audio system with HD radio and a CD player, forward-collision mitigation, and Rear Door Alert. There’s also Easy Fill Tire Alert, a handy little feature that beeps the horn once the tires are at the correct pressure.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is optional on all versions of the 2019 Pathfinder crossover SUV. The SV becomes eligible for more extras, such as blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, navigation, heated steering wheel/front seats/side mirrors, and a towing package. The SL has those driver aids as standard, along with leather upholstery and the motion-activated tailgate, while options include 20-inch alloy wheels, 13-speaker Bose audio, and the dual-pane panoramic moonroof. The Platinum has virtually all these features included in the price, with a rear-seat entertainment system as one of the few extras.
Engine & TransmissionNow we come to the Nissan Pathfinder’s secret weapon. This all-aluminum 3.5-liter V6 is the sole source of Pathfinder propulsion. It develops a meaty 284 horsepower and an equally substantial 259 lb-ft of torque for a pleasing low-end punch. Such muscle allows the Pathfinder to tow 6,000 pounds, making it a top choice for those with a 2-axle trailer. And the engine performs all this with regular gasoline, as opposed to the pricier premium stuff.
 3.5-liter V6 284 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm 259 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (FWD), 19/26 mpg (AWD)
Read Full Review","What's New?The 2019 Pathfinder now has rear parking sensors throughout the range, along with a pair of new-design Type-C USB ports joining four regular Type-A USB ports. Adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the SV trim level, while LED headlights are fitted to the top two trims. Mocha Almond Pearl joins the exterior paint choices.
The 2019 Nissan Pathfinder is a mainstream 3-row crossover SUV. One aspect that makes it stand out in a crowded field of strong contenders is its punchy 284-horsepower V6 that comes as standard. In other respects, the Pathfinder keeps up to date with forward-collision mitigation and blind-spot monitoring, while staying with the pack in terms of safety scores. Buyers have also found its infotainment system easy to navigate. The 2019 Pathfinder’s principal rivals are, however, superb. These include (in no particular order) the revised-for-2019 Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Chevrolet Traverse, Volkswagen Atlas and Ford Explorer.

Driving the Used 2019 Dodge ChargerEven the most basic 2019 Dodge Charger can be a handful, with the standard 3.6-liter V6 producing 292 horsepower (300 horsepower in the GT and SXT AWD). All-wheel drive is optional, but only on the V6-powered models. Stepping up to the R/T and higher trims brings Hemi V8 power ranging from 370 to an astounding 707 in the Charger SRT Hellcat. All Chargers use an 8-speed automatic transmission, which for some reason seems less problematic here than in other Fiat/Chrysler vehicles. All the Chargers deliver impressive cornering, responsive steering and strong brakes, and while the Hellcat is every gearhead’s dream, a more realistic goal would be the R/T Scat Pack with its 485-horsepower 6.4-liter Hemi V8. This model delivers blisteringly fast acceleration, with a reported 0-60-mph time of 4.4 seconds and a top speed of 175 mph. 
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Dodge Charger may be loud and boisterous on the outside, but inside it’s all business. The handsome interior features a cockpit-like dash that angles most of the important bits toward the driver. Depending on the model, you’ll find form-fitting sport seats in leather, Alcantara or new hound’s-tooth cloth. The gauge-cluster screen can be configured to display all types of info, while a nice big 8.4-inch touch screen highlights the excellent Uconnect infotainment system, which we highly recommend. Rear-seat comfort is surprisingly good, with generous hip-, head- and legroom providing plenty of room for adults.
Exterior StylingThis is no wallflower. No shrinking violet. No wolf in sheep’s clothing. No cliché. The Dodge Charger for 2019 looks like what it is: a modern American sedan with plenty of horsepower. It looks tough. It looks mean. It looks you right in the eye. Despite a roofline and overall shape unmistakably linked to previous Chargers built from 1968-1970, this sedan successfully fights being old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern front to rear. Its smoothly rounded nose makes obvious aerodynamic contributions, and the attractive rear includes Dodge’s distinctive layout of the “racetrack” taillight arrangement. New for 2019 are a revised grille and highly sculpted hood on GT and R/T trims.

 6.2-LITER HELLCAT SUPERCHARGED V8 Americans do everything big, which is why while the rest of world stands slack-jawed at the 707 horsepower generated by the Hellcat’s 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8, we Yanks just shrug.
Standard FeaturesLED daytime running lights, acoustic front glass and windshield, power windows with express front up/down, rearview camera, rear parking sensors, 7-inch touch screen with Uconnect 4, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are all standard features on the base 2019 Dodge Charger SXT. Also standard are chrome exhaust tips, automatic headlights that turn themselves on and off, power mirrors, 17-inch wheels and tires, and an electronic reconfigurable gauge cluster. The standard powertrain is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with a strong 292 horsepower backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsTrim levels are tied closely to engine choices, with corresponding moves upward not only in performance but also in features and luxury. Depending on the trim level and options chosen you can have a Charger with a base price well under $30 grand or well over $60,000, and with horsepower just under 300 or more than twice that. Major options include a power sunroof, Alpine and Harman Kardon sound systems, and several packages: Performance Handling Group, Technology Group, Driver Confidence Group, Navigation and others. Forward emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring are available in the Premium Group.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2019 Charger sedan is available with four engine choices. Standard in the SXT and GT models is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with 292 horsepower (300 in the SXT AWD and GT) and plenty of performance for just about anybody. Next up is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 of 370 horsepower, in R/T and Daytona versions. It’s one more step to a 6.4-liter Hemi of 485 horsepower the in R/T Scat Pack trim. And, if a 485-horsepower Hemi isn’t quite enough, there’s the 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi in the SRT Hellcat, with 707 horsepower. In all cases, the transmission is an 8-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive (RWD). All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on the SXT.

The R/T Scat Pack and Hellcat get a new grille and launch assist, while the Hellcat gets an After Run Chiller and Torque Reserve. 
Muscle cars are a uniquely American phenomenon, so when Dodge decided to build a family sedan, it came as no surprise the result turned out like the 2019 Dodge Charger. Powered by its rear wheels, the Charger shuns the cornering-killing setup of such front-drive competitors as the Honda Accord or Chevrolet Impala, although Dodge does offer an all-wheel-drive option. You won’t find any hybrid or small-displacement turbos under the Charger’s hood, just V6 and V8 grunt creating a lineup ranging from the 292-horsepower SXT to the 707-horsepower SRT Hellcat. What lies in between these two is a line of aggressive, powerful and well-equipped sedans born in the U.S.A. and unlike anything else on the road.

Driving the Used 2019 Nissan Versa NoteYes, the 2019 Versa Note is short on thrills, but at least it’s easy to drive, with light steering, excellent outward vision and compact dimensions making easy work of parking. The engine sounds a bit grainy at high revs, and there’s no real joy other than fuel economy to be had from the continually variable transmission (CVT). Ride quality is on the soft side, which is fine for rough surfaces on straight roads, but the car leans over through the curves, while the steering lacks any kind of feel for what the front wheels are doing. It soon becomes apparent, though, that they will not like to be pushed at all, breaking into understeer and letting the nose run wide at a point when most other cars are still gripping the cornering line, leaving the driver with no other option but to ease off the throttle.
Interior ComfortA shortage of thrills is matched by an absence of frills. It’s pretty basic in here, as the hand-cranked windows illustrate. The plastics are a reminder that the 2019 Versa Note’s retail price is comparatively low. There’s only one interior color: Charcoal. However, everything is put together well. Finding the ideal driving position is easy, there’s 40.8 inches of front headroom and an adult-friendly 37 inches of rear legroom. Plus the aforementioned cargo area, which expands to 38.3 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded down. This is one of the most spacious cabins in the subcompact-hatchback class.
Exterior StylingWe’ve already put forward the argument that hatchbacks can be more aesthetically pleasing than their sedan siblings. It could quite easily ring true in this case. Short overhangs, sculpted doors and a large rear spoiler above the rear window (on the SR model) convey a fun character. From a purely practical point of view, the tall doors mean easy entry and exit. The wide-opening rear doors, meanwhile, prove their worth when fitting a child seat, and when buckling in or extracting your bundle of Cheerios-covered joy.
Favorite FeaturesLARGE CARGO CAPACITY For a subcompact hatch that’s just 163 inches long, the 2019 Versa Note enjoys 18.8 cubic feet of luggage space behind its rear seats. That’s better than some midsize-crossover SUVs, let alone direct competition like the Honda Fit (16.6), Chevrolet Sonic (14.9) or Ford Fiesta (10.1).
 EASY FILL TIRE ALERT Many of us have scrambled around looking for the correct tire-pressure information. With the 2019 Versa Note, we just attach the air line to the valve and this highly convenient feature (optional in SV trim, standard in the SR) first flashes the hazard lights to indicate it’s working, then beeps the horn once there’s sufficient inflation.
Standard FeaturesYou know things are bleak when you look at the list of standard equipment and the manufacturer mentions something that really ought to go without saying, like a speedometer. As well as the aforementioned wind-up windows, the extremely sparse S model has 15-inch steel wheels — but no power locks, driver’s-seat height adjustment, cruise control, or even a remote trunk release. And whereas most cars have brake discs at both ends, the Versa Note puts drums at the back. But it does have air conditioning, Bluetooth, a 4-speaker audio system, and active grille shutters for optimum aerodynamic/fuel efficiency. Luckily, the 2019 Versa Note is cheap enough to consider going up to the next SV level, which has a few more amenities and is eligible for some options.
Factory OptionsThe SV provides power windows/locks and cruise control. As mentioned in the “What’s New” section, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto joins this trim, which is also eligible for the SV Special Edition package that includes 15-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/ignition, fog lights and the Easy Fill Tire Alert feature. The range-topping SR trim level has that package’s contents as standard, but goes with 16-inch alloy wheels. The cloth interior is also enlivened by an orange stripe on each seat. Other options include premium paint, frameless self-dimming rearview mirror with universal garage-door opener, and a Rockford Fosgate audio system upgrade.
Engine & TransmissionThis might sound odd, but there’s a downside to achieving 39 mpg on the highway. Such impressive fuel economy is the result of unimpressive muscle: 109 horsepower from a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine bolted to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) tuned for frugality rather than fun. Let’s not bother with zero-to-60-mph times or top speeds; let’s just say the front-drive-only 2019 Versa Note eventually becomes quick enough to keep up with the general freeway flow, which isn’t really an issue during the rush hours anyway.

Read Full Review","What's New?After some additions late in the 2018 model year (rearview camera and 7-inch infotainment touch screen), the only tweak for the 2019 Versa Note is the inclusion of Nissan Connect for the uppermost SV and SR trims, bringing remote services, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, and satellite radio.
The 2019 Nissan Versa Note is the hatchback version of the Versa subcompact sedan. It’s long been the accepted wisdom that Americans prefer sedans to hatchbacks, while other parts of the world favor the latter over the former. Admittedly, having a lockable trunklid keeps valuables safely out of sight and out of reach. But how often do we leave valuables in the car compared with how often we need cargo/passenger versatility? And although this next point is purely subjective, hatchbacks tend to look less awkward than their sedan counterparts. The Versa Note is no sports machine, but it is relatively spacious, cheap to buy and economical to run. It could work well for first-time buyers, small families and commuters looking to keep expenses low.

Driving the Used 2019 GMC YukonAs with its Tahoe and Escalade brethren, the GMC Yukon shows how far GM’s full-size SUVs have come. Though still based on sturdy truck-like body-on-frame construction, the Yukon is quite comfortable considering it also has the capability to tow over 8,000 pounds and go off-roading. Its ride manners shine best on long and wide highways. Opting for magnetic ride control further smooths the driving experience by constantly monitoring and adapting the suspension to quell road imperfections. There’s no denying the size of the Yukon, even in standard form and especially in the longer Yukon XL. It can be a handful in parking lots and a squeeze to put in a garage, so make sure you measure yours first if you plan to park inside. The Yukon’s standard 5.3-liter V8 engine is a potent and gratifying workhorse. We’ve used it to pull trailers and RVs, climb grades and meander along Interstates. It’s always up for the task at hand and rarely feels out of breath. Standard on the 2019 Yukon Denali and now available on the mid-grade SLT trim if you opt for the Graphite Performance Edition is the larger and more powerful 6.2-liter V8. With 420 horsepower/460 lb-ft of torque on tap, it will happily squeal the tires if you lay into it. The base V8 engine remains paired to a mostly smooth 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2-liter V8 uses a refined 10-speed automatic. Unlike a crossover SUV, the 4-wheel-drive system available on the Tahoe is the real deal, with legit low-range gearing thanks to a 2-speed transfer case.
Interior ComfortAs with the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban, the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL are among the few new vehicles other than a van that can seat up to nine passengers. The caveat there is you’ll have to go with the base SLE trim and then opt for a bench seat in front. Far more buyers will choose the more comfortable bucket seats up front, making total passenger count eight. Captain’s seats can also be had in the second row, which makes seating capacity top out at seven. Regardless of setup, the Tahoe is quite roomy, as should be expected of a full-size SUV. Cargo space behind the third row, however, is surprisingly limited at just over 15 cubic feet. Folding the third row, however, expands that space to nearly 52 cubic feet. If you regularly need to use the third row and carry cargo, well, that’s what the Yukon XL is for. Ergonomics on the base Yukon SLE detracts due to a steering column that only tilts and doesn’t telescope. In addition to getting leather instead of cloth, another reason to opt for at least the mid-grade SLT trim is to get a telescoping steering wheel and power-adjustable pedals.
Exterior StylingThe Yukon comes in two sizes: big and bigger. The standard model has an overall length of 203.9 inches — nearly 17 feet. The Yukon XL comes in at 224.4 inches — nearly 19 feet. Like its Tahoe/Suburban/Escalade relatives, the GMC Yukon is slab-sided, big and bold. GMC’s variant of this boxy SUV has its own touches, and further varies its own theme between the standard and Denali models. The Yukon Denali is even more upscale, featuring a prominent honeycomb grille and lots of glitzy chrome. With GMC’s big SUV come big wheels, ranging in size from the standard 18 inches up to optional 22s.
Favorite FeaturesGRAPHITE PERFORMANCE EDITIONOpt for this package, and you can get the Yukon’s bigger and more powerful engine without quite having to spend Denali money. Whereas that top-line Yukon starts at nearly $68,000, you can get an SLT variant with the 6.2-liter V8, 10-speed transmission and other goodies for a few thousand less.
ENHANCED DRIVER ALERTSafety is paramount when driving, especially so when you’re piloting a 5,000-plus-pound SUV. This package adds active-safety features like forward-collision warning with automatic braking, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist. It’s standard on SLT trims and a bargain at only $545 extra on base SLE models.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 GMC Yukon is available in three trims: SLE, SLT and the range-topping Denali. The base SLE offers more standard features than the base Chevy Tahoe LS, but it’s also more expensive. Standard features include 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, keyless entry, front and rear parking sensors, rearview camera, tri-zone climate control, 9-speaker Bose audio system, and 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. If you can swing roughly $5,000 more, we recommend stepping up to the mid-trim SLT trim. It includes conveniences like leather upholstery, a steering wheel that telescopes and tilts, power-adjustable pedals, and power tailgate. It also includes the Enhanced Driver Alert Package with safety features like lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. All models also come with GM’s OnStar telecommunications service (subscription required after trial period) with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity.
Factory OptionsAt the top end, the new Yukon Denali ladles on features and amenities including the bigger V8 engine, magnetic-ride-control suspension, hands-free tailgate, navigation, upgraded Bose audio system with active-noise cancellation, head-up display, perforated leather seating with heated and ventilated front seats, and wireless phone-charging cradle. All Yukon models can be had with 4-wheel drive (4WD) in lieu of the standard (rear-) 2-wheel drive (2WD). In addition to the Graphite Edition packages, the SLT trim can also be had with the new Standard Edition Value Package that bundles sunroof, 2nd-row bucket seats and 20-inch wheels. Other options include blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and power-folding rear seats. A rear-seat entertainment system is also available.
Engine & TransmissionTwo V8 engine choices are available for the 2019 Yukon and Yukon XL. Standard is a 5.3-liter V8 making 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Optional is a 6.2-liter V8 that makes a more robust 420 horsepower/460 lb-ft of torque and is linked to a 10-speed automatic. The 6.2-liter V8 was formerly reserved for Denali models, but is now available on mid-grade SLT trims if you opt for the Graphite Performance Edition. Both engines feature the efficiency benefits of direct gasoline injection and Active Cylinder Management, which seamlessly shuts off half the cylinders during steady cruising to save fuel. Even with these technologies, Yukons aren’t exactly fuel misers. The GMC Yukon is 2WD, with 4WD optional on all trims. The tow rating maxes out at 8,500 pounds, which is slightly lower than the Tahoe’s 8,600-pound rating, and less than the Ford Expedition’s rating of up to 9,300 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2019 GMC Yukon adds an aggressive-looking Graphite Edition for the mid-grade SLT trim that includes 22-inch wheels, blacked-out aesthetics and unique suspension. Building on that is the Graphite Performance Edition, which includes the more powerful 6.2-liter V8, 10-speed transmission and magnetic ride control that were formerly reserved for the top-line Denali edition.
The GMC Yukon and its extended-length variant, the Yukon XL, are the mechanical twins of the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, respectively. The Yukon Denali, meanwhile, is so plush you might mistake it for these models’ luxury sibling, the Cadillac Escalade. All three of these full-size GM sport-utility vehicles are built in the same factory in Arlington, Texas. The GMC variant stands out with its own design aesthetics, and aims to have a slightly more upscale feel than its Chevy counterparts. As a traditional body-on-frame 3-row SUV, it excels at towing and hauling, but as with its kin and Ford Expedition rival, trades some efficiency and comfort for its rugged capabilities. For 2019, the optional and larger of its V8 engine choices can be had on a lower-grade trim.

It’s heavy, which means fuel economy generally lags competitors. The weight also means that even with the available V6 engine it never feels quick; as for the base 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, just skip over that. The Cherokee comes more alive with the new turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder thanks to its better torque delivery. All three engines come connected to a 9-speed automatic that occasionally lags downshifts and upshifts, but at least it’s much smoother than it was when the current Cherokee debuted in 2014. With the extra weight — we’re talking hundreds more than an equivalently equipped CR-V — comes poor fuel economy. However, ride and handling are spot-on, and even though the Cherokee isn’t quick, neither are its competitors. Once you head off-road though, the Cherokee really shines. The Cherokee Trailhawk with its Active Drive Lock all-wheel-drive system is the most rugged choice, but even standard Cherokee models with Active Drive II and its low-range offer capability that most others can’t match. Throw in the available 4,500 pounds of towing capacity with the V6, and the case for the 2019 Cherokee gets clearer.
Interior ComfortSimple but classy, the 2019 Cherokee benefits from a handful of interior upgrades. The subtle dash redesign includes larger air vents, more soft-touch materials, and a bit more storage room as well. The standard infotainment system gets an upgrade to a 7-inch screen that now includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The front seats are comfortable enough, but the driving position takes a hit thanks to a steering wheel that neither tilts high enough nor telescopes enough. Rear-seat passengers get decent leg- and headroom, and the seatbacks recline a tiny bit as well. Surprisingly, Jeep found an additional three cubic feet of cargo space, although the resulting 25.8 cubic feet still trails many competitors.
Exterior StylingGone at last are the odd 3-level headlights that have drawn curious looks since the Cherokee debuted in 2014. Instead there’s a new nose, with new LED headlights sandwiched into a slim enclosure that looks much more similar to the Compass and Grand Cherokee. In back, the license plate moves from the bumper to the tailgate, there are reshaped taillights, and the overall appearance is tidier. The 2019 Cherokee is a solidly handsome compact SUV, even if it’s not a beauty queen like the Mazda CX-5. We especially like the rugged looks of the Trailhawk, with its beefy tires, black-out hood, and red tow hooks projecting from its lower-profile bumper.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBOIt seems like every automaker is introducing a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder these days, and Jeep is no exception. The same basic engine that Jeep recently debuted in the all-new Wrangler, the new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder offers up just as much horsepower as the V6, but more torque, giving the Cherokee decent acceleration at last.
TRAILHAWKThis is a Jeep after all, and there are reputations to be upheld. The Trailhawk increases the ride height, offers the most sophisticated all-wheel drive system, and includes things like a rock-crawl mode and bright red tow hooks. It’s not just appearances though, as the Trailhawk really does acquit itself surprisingly well over the rough stuff.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2019 Jeep Cherokee Latitude comes standard with front-wheel drive (FWD), the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and 17-inch steel wheels. The 7-inch Uconnect 4 screen includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, along with Bluetooth, three USB ports, and the display for the rearview camera. Along with hill-start assist and start/stop, the base Latitude also comes with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-path detection standard; those last are usually upgrades at this price level. There’s also standard air conditioning, the 6-way manually adjustable seats covered in durable cloth, a black-and-white digital info display between the gauges, and keyless entry. If you get all-wheel drive (AWD), Jeep’s Selec-Terrain traction-management system is part of the package.
Factory OptionsThe most obvious options are related to the drivetrain. The base 4-cylinder can (and should) be skipped in favor of either the V6 or, even better, the new turbocharged 4-cylinder. Various AWD systems are also available, with the Jeep Active Drive Lock reserved for Trailhawk models. Other options come as you climb the trim ladder. Limited models get a larger Uconnect screen, leather upholstery and power driver and passenger seats. The luxurious Overland comes standard with the 3.2-liter V6, plus navigation, an upgraded audio system, and generally nicer interior trim. The trail-rated Trailhawk model adds under-body skidplates, a more aggressive AWD system, upgraded suspension, and other enhancements to make it more capable off road.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2.4-liter 4-cylinder manages 180 horsepower, but it has a lot of Cherokee to haul around, and it strains under any but the lightest throttle. Instead, skip it entirely and pick between the 271-horsepower 3.2-liter V6, or even better, the 270-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that’s new this year. While the horsepower numbers are nearly identical, the new turbo-4 has a distinct advantage in torque, offering up 295 lb-ft versus the 239 lb-ft of the V6. However, the V6 can tow 4,500 pounds, 500 more than the turbocharged 4-cylinder. All engines come connected to a 9-speed automatic that’s reasonably smooth, but often slow to respond; it’s better with the V6 and turbocharged engines. All-wheel drive is also available with all three engines, depending on which model you choose.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2019 Jeep Cherokee benefits from a thorough refresh. Updates include a restyled front end that brings the Cherokee closer to the Compass and Grand Cherokee design aesthetic, an updated interior with nicer materials and a bit more cargo space, and a new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.
The 2019 Jeep Cherokee solidifies the Jeep crossover SUV as a unique proposition in the compact-SUV class. While segment leaders like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue — along with virtually every other player in the class — have concentrated on around-town utility, the Cherokee stays true to its Jeep roots with a Trailhawk model that is surprisingly capable off-road. It’s a good trick, and the Cherokee Trailhawk is comfortable on terrain that would send its competition running for the soft comfort of smooth asphalt. Yet it’s not a one-trick pony, offering a V6 engine that can tow up to 4,500 pounds, a new turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes the Cherokee feel almost peppy, and, at last, rugged Jeep good looks. We wish it weighed less, and that there was more cargo space, but if you want a comfortable around-town ride and still want to hit rough terrain in your compact-crossover SUV, the 2019 Jeep Cherokee is in a class of one.

Driving the Used 2019 Dodge DurangoAlthough the V8 engines in the 2019 Durango are arguably more newsworthy, the entry-level-yet-refined V6 works well, delivering 293 horsepower and capable of towing 6,400 pounds. It’s complemented by an 8-speed automatic transmission that only occasionally “hunts” for the right gear. On the other hand, these V8 engines do distinguish the Durango. The 5.7-liter unit generates 360 horsepower, for superb acceleration with a resonant rumble and a tow rating of 7,400 pounds. The 6.4-liter in the SRT trim develops 475 horsepower, good enough to sprint from standstill to 60 mph in a fleeting 4.4 seconds or tow 8,600 pounds. Ease off the throttle, though, and every version of the Durango can be quiet and comfortable.
Interior ComfortIt’s a pleasant place inside the 2019 Durango, with an air about it that seems higher in quality than most rivals, the deluxe Citadel trim in particular. This is the version with heated/ventilated front seats and heated 2nd-row seats. Most trim levels offer captain’s chairs to replace the bench in the second row, which also make it easier to access the third row and use booster seats. Cargo space when all three rows are in place is useful at 17 cubic feet, expanding to 43.3 and then 85.1. The front-passenger seat also folds down, so the Durango can take quite long items. Citadel and SRT versions may also be specified with headliners of simulated suede.
Exterior StylingThe revamped GT’s front end now offers the option of an SRT-style hood with a center air inlet. In general, the 2019 Durango’s styling roams a territory that encompasses a certain toughness, a fair amount of chrome in a few trim levels, and a subtly sporty look in others. The “racetrack taillight” design that spans the entire rear end is certainly distinctive, but can also come across as obnoxiously bright to anyone driving behind the Durango at night.
Favorite FeaturesDURANGO SRT Our favorite iteration, because it brings out our enthusiast side. It seats only six, but it’s seriously quick, yet also comfortable and capable. And sounds glorious while carrying out its duties.
 UCONNECT 8.4 The Uconnect system in Dodge (and Chrysler and Jeep vehicles) is one of the best touch-screen-based infotainment setups. The latest version has a clean appearance with a user-friendly interface and comes with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
Standard FeaturesThe SXT entry-level trim has seating for five, tri-zone automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, V6 engine (with a Sport mode to spice up the driving experience), load-leveling rear shock absorbers, leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry/ignition, and an infotainment system that includes AM/FM radio, Bluetooth, auxiliary audio input, six speakers and a 7-inch touch screen. Moving up the 2019 Durango’s trim levels brings more equipment, such as a power tailgate, sunroof, navigation, Nappa leather seats, and more. Versions with V8 engines receive beefier brakes, while the SRT also has a sport-tuned adaptive suspension.
Factory OptionsSome options are available in the base 2019 Durango SXT, such as a sunroof, all-wheel drive with low-range gearing, roof rails, cosmetic additions, 20-inch alloy wheels, satellite radio, trailer-prep package, and rear parking sensors. But the higher trims are eligible for more extras, including an 825-watt/19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, 8.4-inch infotainment system with navigation, Blu-ray/DVD rear-seat entertainment system, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision mitigation, and lane-keeping assistance. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is optional throughout the range. For towing, choose the 220-amp alternator, heavy-duty engine oil cooler and Class IV hitch receiver.
Engine & TransmissionThe 3.6-liter V6 that’s standard in the lower 2019 Durango trims is capable of respectable acceleration and confident overtaking. It’s also less thirsty than its V8 counterparts. The 5.7-liter V8 is standard in the R/T and optional in the Citadel version; the 6.4-liter V8 is exclusive to the all-wheel-drive-only (and dauntingly quick) SRT. The rest of the range has rear-wheel drive (RWD) as standard with all-wheel drive (AWD) on their options lists. All engines are linked to an 8-speed automatic transmission, and the V8s can deactivate four cylinders under light loads to help save some gasoline.

And the Citadel model has 2nd-row captain’s chairs as standard.
The 2019 Dodge Durango has its own special place in the automotive world. It’s a midsize SUV offering V8 muscle and a remarkable towing capacity of 8,600 pounds. It can also seat up to seven with adult-friendly space in the third row. There’s nothing else around that can match this combination of talents, especially at the Durango’s price level. Granted, this generation has been on sale since 2011, which is a long time in vehicle years (they’re a bit like dog years), but it still has plenty to offer. Such as Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration as standard, a user-friendly infotainment system, and respectable off-road credentials, thanks to 8.1 inches of ground clearance and (optional) all-wheel drive with low-range gearing.

Destination price is an additional $895. If you want AWD, the SportWagen 4Motion begins at $24,395. As with the FWD model, opting for an automatic transmission is an extra $1,100. The SportWagen SE, which comes with an automatic transmission, starts at $29,995. At these prices, the SportWagen starts above the Subaru Impreza 5-door, which is slightly smaller but comes standard with all-wheel drive. At $26,895, the more rugged and better equipped VW Golf Alltrack commands a premium over the SportWagen 4Motion on which it’s based. Another alternative in this class, the Kia Niro hybrid, starts at $23,490. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The VW Golf SportWagen’s resale value is expected to be about average, but still significantly trail that of the Subaru Impreza.
Driving the Used 2019 Volkswagen Golf SportWagenThe Volkswagen Golf SportWagen proudly stands at the corner where fun and practicality intersect. The new 1.4-liter engine that powers front-wheel-drive (FWD) models loses horsepower to the older 1.8-liter that still powers all-wheel-drive (AWD) versions, but we’ve found it peppy nonetheless. It is also quite fuel-efficient. Like its Golf and Jetta siblings, the SportWagen stands out among compact cars with its taut yet comfortable driving manners. It isn’t the most powerful thing on the road, but this VW manages to feel spry overall. The new 8-speed automatic transmission is remarkably smooth. And if manual transmissions are your thing, we’re happy to report that there’s an excellent one in this VW. It’s so easy to use that even a new driver could learn on it. SportWagen 4Motion models use Volkswagen’s all-wheel-drive system, and we highly endorse it if you live in a cold-weather state or otherwise have to deal with slick or snowy roads. Unfortunately, the 4Motion AWD system is available only on base S models. If you want a fancier version — that is also more rugged and has a bit more ground clearance — look to the VW Alltrack.
Interior ComfortA big reason you buy a wagon is for space, and the VW SportWagen delivers it in spades. For such a modestly sized 5-passenger vehicle, this VW makes excellent use of its interior. Behind the rear seats is a flat floor with a substantial 30.4 cubic feet of space. When you need room for longer items or more stuff, the seats fold nearly flat, creating 66.5 cubic feet. That’s on par with a small SUV. Aside from its roominess, the SportWagen’s interior is well laid out. Controls for climate and audio are easy to see and use. S models have a 6.5-inch touch screen, while the SE variants feature a larger and crisper 8-inch screen. Cloth upholstery comes in the S trims, and SE models have a more premium Leatherette.
Exterior StylingVW’s 2019 SportWagen looks more prominent than the Golf hatchback, because it is. The wagon is over a foot longer than the hatchback, giving it a long, lean and purposeful appearance. Just last year VW upgraded the look of the SportWagen with new front-end styling, including new LED daytime-running lights and LED taillights. Wagons aren’t nearly as common as they used to be, and the SportWagen’s long roof and upright hatch make it stand out further with a distinctive European flavor. It looks sporty yet practical, and it has the kind of classic shape that holds up for years to come.
Favorite Features4MOTION ALL-WHEEL DRIVEDespite the popularity of all-wheel drive, Volkswagen is among just a handful of automakers to offer it on small cars. VW’s excellent 4Motion all-wheel-drive system is available on the Golf SportWagen, and it can be had with an automatic or a manual transmission. The system increases the wagon’s traction on all road surfaces including the snowy and slushy messes of winter.
VOLKSWAGEN WARRANTYCalled the People First Warranty and introduced for the 2018 model year, it bolsters confidence in new Volkswagens with coverage of six years or 72,000 miles. Furthermore, it can be transferred to the next owner should you sell the vehicle while it’s still under warranty.
Standard FeaturesThe Golf SportWagen lineup has been simplified for 2019, with just two trims offered: S and SE. In base S form, you’ll get the basics like cruise control and power accessories, plus a leather-covered steering wheel, roof rails, 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and a 6-speaker infotainment AM/FM/HD Radio system with a 6.5-inch display, USB port and Bluetooth connectivity. We like that all SportWagen models include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink smartphone integration. All-wheel-drive 4Motion SportWagen models, only offered in S trim, also get heated seats, 16-inch wheels, and the larger 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. The SportWagen S comes with a 6-speed manual transmission. An 8-speed automatic is $1,100 extra.
Factory OptionsIf you opt for the Golf SportWagen S, we highly recommend adding the Driver Assist Package. It’s only $450, and it has the potential to prevent an accident with features like forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and a blind-spot monitor. The SportWagen SE includes those features, plus other aids like lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and an enhanced blind-spot monitoring that can counter steer the car if a collision appears imminent. SE models are also upgraded with Leatherette upholstery, panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, fog lights, heated front seats, a 115-volt power outlet in the rear cargo area, push-button start and keyless entry. Opting for the SE also gets a better infotainment system with an 8-inch screen, auxiliary input and a CD player (it’s in the glove box). The SE comes with an automatic transmission as standard.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2019, front-wheel-drive (FWD) versions of the Golf SportWagen replace the former 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder for a smaller 1.4-liter turbo that is also used in the all-new 2019 Jetta. The engine doesn’t have quite as much power as the 1.8, but is even more efficient, hitting up to 37 mpg on the highway. It is linked to your choice of a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive (AWD) SportWagens, called 4Motion, retain the more powerful 1.8-liter. In addition to the 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that most buyers will prefer, it can be had with an engaging and easy-to-use 6-speed manual.

Base S trims now offer the Driver Assistance package with features like blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking. The top-line SEL trim has been discontinued.
The 2019 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen is something of a rare breed these days: a small station wagon. But its niche status amid a sea of SUVs makes it all the more special. True to its name, this VW wagon is sporty yet immensely practical and efficient. It has more cargo capacity than the Subaru Impreza 5-door and every other hatchback in its class, while its turbocharged engine and taut European driving manners grant satisfying driving manners while earning up to 37 mpg. Drivers requiring the traction of all-wheel drive can get that in the 4Motion SportWagen, and both models can be had with another rarity — a manual transmission. Starting at"

The upright greenhouse provides good headroom and outward visibility, while the Renegade’s overall image is pure Jeep.","ConsWhen it comes to driving, you’ll have more fun in a Mazda CX-3 or Nissan Kicks. The Honda HR-V offers better resale and reliability, as do many of the Renegade’s competitors. The slightly larger Subaru Crosstrek can go anywhere the Renegade can, offers better fuel economy and comes standard with all-wheel drive.",23000,"Used 2019 Jeep Renegade PricingThe 2019 Jeep Renegade has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $23,000 for a base, 2WD model. That’s an attractive price but offers few frills. With popular features such as air conditioning and a touch-screen infotainment system, expect costs to rise to the mid-$20,000 range. At the upper end, loaded Trailhawk and Limited models can reach well past $30,000. At these prices, the Renegade is in line with the Fiat 500X, Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V, above that of the more hard-to-define Kia Soul but below a comparably equipped Subaru Crosstrek. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Jeep Renegade. As for the Renegade’s resale, it seems to hold about average values, well below the Honda HR-V and Subaru Crosstrek, but on par with the Chevrolet Trax.
Driving the Used 2019 Jeep RenegadeThe 2019 Renegade jettisons the old 1.4-liter turbo in favor of a new 1.3-liter turbo producing 177 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Unlike the old engine, this one is available only with the 9-speed automatic. While unique in this segment, we’ve had issues in the past with this transmission, namely its sluggish response time and shift habits. We’ll have to wait and see if this new model delivers faster shifts. The standard engine remains the 2.4-liter Tigershark, which offers 180 horsepower, but only 175 lb-ft of torque. The Renegade is a heavy vehicle, even more so when equipped with its 4-wheel-drive system. As a result, acceleration is about average for this class. On the road, the Renegade’s performance is adequate for daily commutes, but a far cry from the more athletic performance of the Mazda CX-3, Honda HR-V and Toyota C-HR. However, when the paved road ends, most of the Renegade’s competitors lack the ability to follow, the one exception being the Subaru Crosstrek.
Interior ComfortYou and the 2019 Renegade may be in rush-hour gridlock, but the mud splatter printed on the face of the Jeep’s tachometer will remind you that the weekend is getting closer by the second. It’s as if the SUV were telling you, “Hang in there. You can make it.” The Jeep Renegade can fit five but is really more comfortable with just four people on board. There’s also 18.5 cubic feet of storage capacity behind the rear seats. That expands to over 50 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, and in all but base models, the front-passenger seat folds to accommodate longer items like surfboards.
Exterior StylingRound headlights? Check. Seven-slotted vertical grille? Check. Rugged attitude? Check. Short overhangs for rock climbing? Check. One of the best things about the 2019 Jeep Renegade is that it looks like a Jeep. A real Jeep. It’s as if the Renegade is a greatest-hits mix tape engineered from the DNA of the iconic Wrangler and the luxurious Grand Cherokee. Its angles and upright greenhouse even sample from the Willys MB of the 1940s. Still, the Renegade manages to be more modern than retro, with plenty of black trim and curvaceous surfacing. Although the “X” featured in its unique taillights is derived from army jerrycans. And that’s just cool.
Favorite FeaturesSELEC-TERRAINSimilar to the advanced 4×4 systems found on Land Rovers, the Jeep Renegade’s 4-wheel-drive system allows the driver to select up to five settings; Auto, Snow, Sand, Mud and, on Trailhawk trims, Rock. The Trailhawk also includes Hill Descent Control and a 20:1 rock crawl ratio.
MY SKY OPEN AIR SUNROOFThe My Sky sunroof features removable panels that can be stored in the cargo area creating a very Wrangler-like open-air experience. If you just want fresh air, the front panel can be slid back or vented like a traditional power sunroof. The Renegade also offers a power glass panoramic sunroof.
Standard FeaturesJeep’s Renegade for 2019 comes in four trims: Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk. The base model’s roughly $23,000 starting price is tempting and grants immediate access to the Jeep brand, but is rather light on content with simpler features like an AM/FM radio with USB input, 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat, tilt/telescopic steering column, rearview camera, power windows and door locks, and 16-inch wheels. Most glaring is its lack of standard air conditioning and cruise control. We recommend stepping up even one trim level to Latitude, which brings those two basic features along with a 7-inch Uconnect touch-screen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.
Factory OptionsFour-wheel drive is optional on all new Jeep Renegade models except Trailhawk, where it’s standard. The 1.3-liter turbocharged engine is standard on Limited and Trailhawk models, optional on all others. Other options that vary by trim include blind-spot monitoring and lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, leather seats, navigation, heated seats and steering wheel, 506-watt Beats audio with nine speakers, the My Sky removable-roof system, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control and rear park-assist. Four-wheel-drive models have a terrain-select system that optimizes the Jeep’s traction for settings like Snow, Sand, Mud and — on Trailhawk models — Rock.
Engine & TransmissionTwo 4-cylinder engines are available for the 2019 Jeep Renegade. Sport and Latitude models come with a 2.4-liter engine, while Limited and Trailhawk use a new 1.3-liter turbocharged engine that is optional on the other trims. Both can be had with 4WD instead of the standard 2-wheel-(front) drive (2WD). A 9-speed automatic is standard across the line. The Jeep Renegade can tow up to 2,000 pounds with the 2.4-liter engine and 4WD.

In the competitive field of subcompact SUVs, the 2019 Jeep Renegade is a standout. Unlike the Mazda CX-3 or Honda HR-V, the Renegade offers two engine choices plus an advanced 4-wheel-drive (4WD) system with settings for Snow, Sand, Mud and, on the Trailhawk trim, Rock.

I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.
Then again, maybe I should be thinking about a used car.
Driving the Used 2019 Cadillac EscaladeIt looks imposing and it intimidates other drivers like Dale Earnhardt, but from behind the wheel the 2019 Cadillac Escalade is a pussycat. The Caddy is comfortable, easy-to-drive, sure-footed and powerful. Sure it’s big, and parking this beast or backing it up in tight parking garages can be challenging, but on the road it’s like a high-riding luxury sedan with impeccable manners and a refined ride. Cadillac’s 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V8 is a lovable brute. Power for passing and merging is never in short supply and the new 10-speed automatic transmission is responsive and smooth. GM’s Magnetic Ride Control does an admirable job managing the Escalade’s bulk, allowing it to soak up rough roads and negotiate tight turns with little fuss. The power-steering assist is appropriately proportioned. Add the optional 4-wheel drive and the Escalade becomes a winter warrior capable of tackling all kinds of road conditions.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Cadillac Escalade is all about interior room, with the ESV offering an abundance of it in all three rows. Soft leather covers the seats while wood inlays and loads of high-tech add-ons grace the dash. With the 2nd-row bench option the Escalade can seat eight, although we imagine most will prefer the bucket-seat setup that allows for easy access to the third row. That third row can fold flat into the floor, but creates a slight rise at the rear liftgate opening, requiring items to be lifted a few additional inches before sliding in. With both the second and third rows folded, open space increases to 94.2 cubic feet or over 120 cubic feet in the Escalade ESV.
Exterior StylingYou can’t miss the new Escalade’s massive grille, but you might not see the active-aero shutters behind it, which close to improve aerodynamics on the highway and increase fuel economy. The 2019 Cadillac Escalade also benefits from full-LED headlights with four crystals in the headlights that act as the high beams, giving off radiant light. The long vertical taillights also employ LEDs, making it easier to follow the Escalade when weather conditions are less than ideal, which improves safety. Originally installed for aerodynamic purposes, the rear spoiler not only adds a sporting flair to the SUV’s derriere, it also hides the rear-windshield wiper. At 224.3 inches, the Escalade ESV model is about two feet longer than the standard model.
Favorite FeaturesAUTOMATIC PARK ASSIST
Parallel parking can be a chore in itself, but when you add nearly 19 feet of automobile to the mix, the task seems daunting. Thankfully, Cadillac’s Automatic Park Assist comes standard. Just pull up to a spot and the ultrasonic sensors do the steering while you work the pedals and gear selector.
MASSAGE FRONT SEATS
Every Escalade includes multi-way power-adjustable front seats that both heat and cool, but the Platinum trim takes it step further by offering a massaging feature. Used in tandem with the heat setting, the seats offer a muscle-relaxing session that can be set for anti-fatigue, rolling or kneading at varying degrees of intensity.
Standard FeaturesStandard luxuries on the new Cadillac Escalade include 12-way power-adjustable seats, 20-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels, Magnetic Ride Control and hands-free power liftgate. A remote starter, tri-zone climate control, and a reconfigurable instrument cluster further the Escalade’s appeal, as do a power-folding 3rd-row seat, heated and cooled front seats, front and rear park assists, rain-sensing wipers, a surround-vision camera, Automatic Park Assist, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible 16-speaker Bose Centerpoint audio, onboard Wi-Fi, CUE with navigation and a power tilt/telescopic steering column with heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. Also standard is Automatic Park Assist, which can practically parallel-park the SUV for you, and Surround Vision, which provides a bird’s-eye 360-degree view of the vehicle and its surroundings.
Factory OptionsLane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, adaptive cruise control, side blind-zone alert, rear-camera mirror, cross-traffic alert, upgraded braking systems and 22-inch machine-finished wheels are all available on the 2019 Cadillac Escalade. For buyers seeking the most indulgence, the range-topping Platinum line comes with Nappa semi-aniline leather, suede microfiber headliner and climate-controlled 18-way-adjustable front seats complete with massaging functionality for the driver’s side. A head-up display is also available, as are a sunroof, a rear-entertainment system with a 9-inch overhead screen, wireless headphones and remote control. Top Platinum models get a unique chrome grille, power-retractable side steps, a suede headliner and a leather-wrapped instrument cluster and console.
Engine & TransmissionCadillac offers only one engine choice for the 2019 Escalade and Escalade ESV: a 6.2-liter V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Standard models are pushed by their rear wheels (2WD), with 4-wheel drive (4WD) an extra-cost option. Regardless of drive mode, GM’s newest 10-speed automatic transmission takes care of power delivery, providing smooth shifts and pretty respectable highway fuel economy considering the massive weight it’s tasked with helping move. Premium fuel is not required but recommended, helping save a few cents at the pump when you don’t need the full muscle and might of the Escalade’s big V8.

The 2019 Cadillac Escalade doesn’t do anything small or subtle. It’s a full-size luxury SUV that unashamedly declares itself king of the hill with copious amounts of chrome trim, yards of leather, a massive 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 engine and just about every electronic gadget known to the automotive industry. Offered in regular and king size (Escalade ESV), the Chevy Suburban-based Escalade has everything it needs to go toe-to-toe with the Infiniti QX80, Land Rover Range Rover and Lexus LX.

Driving the Used 2019 Toyota 4RunnerA relatively unsophisticated ride quality brings bearable manners on smooth roads and some cushioning over rougher surfaces, but the 2019 4Runner will lean noticeably if a corner is taken with anything like gusto. In general, this body-on-frame setup results in truck-like rather than car-like ride and handling. However, the 270-horsepower V6 is a superb engine, with plenty of muscle for passing, towing and getting up to freeway speeds. Fuel economy, on the other hand, is not its best feature. The 4Runner’s weight and only having five forward gears in its automatic transmission have their impact on this situation. And we’ve found the brake pedal can be tricky to modulate. On challenging terrain, the 4Runner excels, thanks to a fairly narrow body and potential 9.6 inches of ground clearance (with the dedicated off-road suspension).
Interior ComfortThe cabin layout in the 2019 4Runner is simple but effective. Buttons and dials are large and easy to use, even when selecting the low-range gearing. The center console has the option of a 120-volt outlet. The power-adjustable front seats are comfortable and supportive, fine for longer trips, while the reclining 2nd-row seats split and fold in a 40/20/40 configuration for some passenger/cargo versatility. Folding them flat opens up a load area of almost 90 cubic feet. The SR5 and Limited trim levels offer a 3rd-row seat, but that’s more kid-friendly than adult-sized.
Exterior StylingOf all the trim levels available with the 2019 4Runner, the all-wheel-drive TRD Pro looks the most rugged, with a hood scoop, skidplates, chunky tires and raised suspension. Every version has a roof rack as standard. The overall design is essentially a “2-box” approach enlivened somewhat by flared fenders. The front overhang is relatively short, which is good news for off-roaders.
Favorite FeaturesREAR LIFTGATE POWER WINDOW This feature has a two-fold benefit. It allows stuff to be loaded into the cargo area without opening the entire tailgate. And if rearward vision is hampered by caked-on dust or mud, simply lower the window for a short-term fix.
 TRD PRO This is the serious off-roading version, with shocks from Fox (a well-respected third-party manufacturer), Nitto Terra Grappler all-terrain tires, and extra under-body protection — the front skidplate is 0.25 of an inch thick.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 4Runner comes in SR5/SR5 Premium, Limited, and TRD Off-Road/Off-Road Premium/Pro trim levels. The basic SR5 has Entune Audio Plus with the Connected Navigation app and Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth music streaming, and an 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. The TRD models deploy all-wheel drive (the default is rear-wheel drive), add water-resistant seat fabric, locking rear differential, and multi-terrain selection with crawl control. TRD Pro receives a 15-speaker JBL sound system, navigation, and the Fox suspension. Limited models have 20-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, leather-trimmed seats (heated/ventilated in front), moonroof, and an X-REAS (cross-linked relative absorber system) suspension for better body control.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is optional in the SR5 and Limited versions, standard in the TRD models. Other extras include the 3rd-row seat and a handy sliding cargo deck, while the off-road specialist TRD versions are also available with the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) that can disconnect the stabilizer bars to allow more axle travel and therefore help conquer tougher terrain. The 2019 model year brings a Voodoo Blue paint choice for TRD versions.
Engine & TransmissionToyota’s midsize SUV is motivated by a strong 4.0-liter V6 generating 270 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is standard in the SR5 and Limited versions. A part-time all-wheel drive (AWD) system is fitted to the TRD models, while a full-time AWD setup with a limited-slip locking center differential is offered in the Limited. In all cases, the transmission is a 5-speed automatic; AWD versions have low-range gearing. The 2019 4Runner is rated to tow 5,000 pounds. It’s okay to use regular gasoline, but fuel consumption is relatively poor, with all versions achieving an average of 18 mpg.

As crossover SUVs become ever more popular, the 2019 Toyota 4Runner SUV looks increasingly like a different breed. It isn’t based on a car platform but uses a body-on-frame construction, putting it in that category known as “old school.” But hey, Harvard is an old school. These places have their advantages. The 4Runner midsize SUV is tough and remarkably capable when tarmac gives way to tougher terrain. Ford Explorer? Nissan Pathfinder? These are just nice names compared with the 4Runner’s affinity for the wild. It also enjoys Toyota’s virtually bombproof reliability. Despite a perfectly acceptable ride quality on paved roads, the 4Runner’s age doesn’t allow it to offer driver-assistance aids like forward-collision mitigation or blind-spot monitoring.

Driving the Used 2019 Toyota SiennaWhen there’s a minivan full of people and/or stuff, it’s always good to have that smooth, reliable and muscular 296-horsepower V6 up front, especially during overtaking or tackling uphill stretches. When it’s just the driver present, that thrust can also be somewhat entertaining, although the Sienna’s chassis is generally built for comfort more than agility. The exception being the SE trim, whose 19-inch wheels and sportier suspension provide a little more feedback and precision. Although there is a noticeable rise in the level of road and tire noise creeping into the otherwise serene cabin.
Interior ComfortIt’s all about the space, which accommodates three rows of seating for eight occupants or, with the optional 2nd-row captain’s chairs, seven. The range-topping Limited models only have seating for seven (with extra-plush 2nd-row seating), likewise those versions with all-wheel drive. The 2019 Sienna provides four LATCH points for child safety seats, plenty of nooks and crannies up front for devices and bags, plus ample cargo space behind the third row. Fold down both rows, with the second row placed as far forward as possible, and cargo area expands to 117.8 cubic feet. Removing the 2nd-row seats (they’re heavy and somewhat awkward) opens things up to 150 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingIn SE trim, the 2019 Sienna goes for 19-inch alloy wheels, smoked headlights and low-level spoilers at both ends. The rest of the range is a little less detailed, which can be a positive or a negative, depending on personal taste. The doors are nice and big, as they need to be, for easy entry and exit. Something like the Honda Odyssey might be more visually interesting, but the Sienna’s lines and shapes go exactly where they need to. The large glass areas help to provide excellent outward vision.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE It’s odd, frankly, that other companies don’t also offer all-wheel drive in their minivans. It’s an affordable boon for those who live where winter strikes hard, offers extra reassurance and is no doubt worth the slight hit in fuel economy.
 MOBILITY SOLUTIONS Passengers requiring mobility assistance will really appreciate these optional features for the Toyota Sienna. They include the factory-installed Auto Access Seat, which is a power-operated chair bringing easier 2nd-row access, plus an aftermarket wheelchair ramp.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Sienna minivan comes in L, LE, SE, XLE and Limited trims. The basic 7-seater L has the Toyota Safety Sense array of features (forward-collision mitigation, lane-keeping assistance, intelligent cruise control, automatic high beams and road-sign recognition), plus tri-zone climate control, infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay, and Amazon Alexa. LE brings power-sliding side doors, power-adjustable driver’s seat, an upgraded infotainment setup and easy-clean seating fabric. All 2019 Siennas come with Toyota Care, covering two years/25,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsFor more equipment, buyers should explore the higher trims of the 2019 Sienna. For example, a power tailgate, simulated and real leather upholstery, navigation, moonroof, push-button start, and Driver Easy Speak. This last feature feeds the driver’s voice through the rear speakers to really get the kids’ attention. The Limited trim includes a JBL audio setup with a 10-inch subwoofer, while a Blu-ray/DVD rear-seat entertainment system with HDMI inputs and two power outlets is also available. Blind-spot monitoring is among the extra safety features. All-wheel drive can’t be specified for the basic L trim.
Engine & TransmissionA 3.5-liter V6 propels the 2019 Sienna with a respectable 296 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque — achieved with regular gasoline and managing similarly respectable (but not class-leading) fuel economy. An 8-speed automatic transmission directs that energy to either the front wheels (FWD) in standard form, or to all four if the all-wheel-drive (AWD) system is chosen. With either layout, the Toyota Sienna is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds.

The 2019 Toyota Sienna moves into its latest model year as the one minivan to offer all-wheel drive, a distinction it’s held for a long time. During that period, the Sienna has evolved into superior transport for families and their paraphernalia, more practical than a crossover SUV or a wagon. It can seat up to eight and the interior is versatile enough to handle anything from furniture to surfboards. The Sienna comes in five trim levels to suit a range of budgets, demands and tastes. Its exterior design is arguably more conservative than rivals like the Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Pacifica, but no one usually chooses a minivan to make style statements.

On the other side of the pricing spectrum, the Sentra SL starts around $24,000, which is a pretty solid bargain for a car with adaptive cruise, blind-spot detection and forward-emergency braking. The SR Turbo starts around $23,500, while the Nismo model is just over $26,000. Prices are on the lower side for the segment, undercutting cars like the Honda Civic and VW Jetta, but coming in a bit higher than the Kia Forte. As a long-term prospect, the 2019 Sentra’s resale value is about average for the compact-sedan class, but its solidity and refinement make it feel like it’s worth more. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2019 Sentra.
OK, so what’s next?I’m interested in this car. What’s for sale near me?I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.Then again, maybe I should be thinking about a used car.
Driving the Used 2019 Nissan SentraThe Sentra’s ride is comfortable, and visibility is excellent. The interior is also pleasingly spacious. It’s a pleasant sedan in the city, but it’s not a car you would hesitate to road-trip either. Its interior is quiet on the highway, and its highway fuel economy is impressive. It’s easy to average over 35 mpg. Power is sufficient, but a drive in the mountains with a few on board will make you wish for more. With 188 horsepower speed comes easier for the Sentra SR Turbo and Sentra Nismo. These turbocharged models are quick and much more fun to drive. However, even in Nismo trim the Sentra’s handling is not the best in this class. The Sentra still uses an antiquated rear-suspension design that keeps it from turning corners as well as the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and VW Golf, which are more athletic. The Sentra’s steering does feel good, however, and its brakes provide plenty of strong stopping power.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Nissan Sentra is equipped with a wide, comfortable and attractive interior, one of the largest in its class. According to the EPA, the Sentra’s interior qualifies it as a midsize car, although Nissan clearly classifies the Sentra as a compact. Front-seat comfort is excellent, with higher-trim models offering a power driver’s seat and heated front seats. The dash layout is simple but elegant, and upscale touches like soft-touch door armrests, piano-black accents and a 5-inch color touch screen add a premium feel. Thanks to the 60/40-split-folding rear seats, the Sentra’s 15.1-cubic-foot trunk can be easily expanded. 
Exterior StylingUnlike its little brother, the plain Nissan Versa sedan, the 2019 Sentra is well proportioned and attractive. Its design closely mimics the shape of Nissan’s larger Altima sedan with athletic curves and a subtle flare of its wheelwells. Although it’s more conservative than some other designs in the class, the Sentra’s sculpted flanks and dramatic headlights and grille treatment keep it from being boring, while the touches of bright trim around the greenhouse, grille and door handles give it an upscale presence. SL and SR trim levels feature LED low-beam headlights as well. Nissan’s wheel designs are also attractive, and the Sentra Nismo gets dark chrome, unique side sills, aggressive front and rear bumper covers and a red stripe.
Favorite FeaturesACTIVE UNDERSTEER CONTROL Standard on all but the base S with the 6-speed manual, the Sentra’s Active Understeer Control lightly applies brake force to the inside front wheel during cornering. This action improves traction as well as the car’s ability to corner aggressively.
 SAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGIES Nissan’s dedication to safety is front and center with the Sentra. With the exception of the Nismo, all models equipped with an automatic transmission also come with Automatic Emergency Braking. Optional driver assists include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.
Standard FeaturesThe most basic 2019 Nissan Sentra is the S, and it comes with a 6-speed manual, three driving modes — Eco, Normal and Sport — and standard air conditioning. It’s also equipped with Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a USB port, keyless entry and trunk release, electroluminescent gauges, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, auto headlights, and an audio system with four speakers. For extra cargo space, the rear seatbacks fold in a 60/40 split. With the exception of the Nismo, all 2019 Sentras with the automatic transmission get Automatic Emergency Braking, and the automatic is standard on SV, SR and SL models.
Factory OptionsThe 2019 Sentra SL is the top dog, but the Sentra SR also comes with the LED low-beam headlights, larger 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless ignition, and it can be equipped with the same upgraded audio system that includes a 5.8-inch screen and navigation. SR and SL models also get heated outside mirrors, and the SL gets a moonroof and leather upholstery. Other available luxuries include Nissan Voice Recognition for audio and navigation and a long list of safety systems including Intelligent Cruise Control, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The Sentra Nismo gets sport seats, red interior accents and a racy suede-and-leather-covered steering wheel.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2019 Nissan Sentra S, SV, SR and SL all employ the same 1.8-liter engine rated at 130 horsepower. That figure drops to 124 when equipped with the CVT automatic. While this engine is one of the least powerful in its class, it works fine in most driving situations. Those requiring more urgency should opt for the turbocharged 1.6-liter engine in the SR Turbo and Nismo. The turbo puts out 188 horsepower and can be teamed with either the CVT or a 6-speed manual. For those who don’t mind shifting their own gears, performance with the manual is better than with the CVT with a minimal decrease in fuel economy. 1.8-liter inline-4 (6-speed manual) 130 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm (124 horsepower w/CA emissions) 128 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm (125 lb-ft w/CA emissions) EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/35 mpg

Those seeking to venture off-road would be better off in a Jeep Compass or Subaru Crosstrek.",24750,"A refreshed 2020 Kia Sportage is coming soon, with improved tech!
Driving the Used 2019 Kia SportageIt’d be easy to just point to the 240-horsepower turbocharged Sportage SX as the model to get, thanks to its additional power, but the reality is that few will complain about the standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and its 181 horsepower. It’s a surprisingly eager combination, with the standard 6-speed automatic transmission unobtrusive in its operation, just as it should be. The bonus is that it also gets notably better fuel economy than the turbo. That’s not to say that the turbo’s additional power isn’t without its charms of course, and if you’re looking for maximum acceleration, then the SX and its turbo engine are the way to go. Kia has improved its electrically assisted power steering to the point where it feels more natural than before, and the suspension overall, even in SX models, is smoother than in the previous Sportage.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Kia Sportage is a very nice place to spend time. The seats are supportive and comfortable on long trips, the controls logically placed and the dashboard’s bright red backlighting is easy on the eyes at night. There are cubbies and storage spots galore and on upper-end trims, heated rear seats. The roomy rear seat features reclining seatbacks and plenty of space to stretch out, although headroom takes a hit when the optional panoramic sunroof is onboard. The Sportage’s 30.7 feet of cargo space is pretty good, but far short of what is offered by the Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester.
Exterior StylingYou either like the high-mounted headlights or you don’t, so you can make up your own mind there. As for the rest of the stubby little Sportage, we’re quite fond of it. The lines are clean and crisp. The ""tiger-nose"" grille treatment works well here, both aesthetically and in establishing the Sportage as a Kia from first glance. The SX Turbo models get dual exhausts and cool LED fog lights. If you opt for all-wheel drive (AWD), you get a bit more ride height versus the front-wheel-drive models (FWD), and a unique nose with a steeper approach angle.
Favorite FeaturesGLORIOUS KNOBSRejecting the temptation to turn the Sportage into a rolling tablet, Kia has wisely retained a generous portion of old-fashioned knobs and hard buttons for things like climate control and fan speed. The touch-screen infotainment system is the one exception, but even it has proper knobs for volume and tuning.
LUXURY AMENITIES, MAINSTREAM PRICEOnce the sole domain of expensive luxury SUVs, the Kia Sportage’s available equipment list includes such high-end features as heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, 320-watt harman/kardon audio system, a panoramic sunroof and a power liftgate.
Standard FeaturesThe base Sportage LX model adds stain-resistant YES Essentials upholstery as standard equipment, which includes a 5-inch touch-screen display and rearview camera, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with USB input and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, drive-mode selector (Sport, Normal, Eco), and automatic headlights. The mid-level EX is an even better deal, especially since blind-spot detection, cross-traffic alert, power-folding outside mirrors with turn signals, and glossy interior trim were added to a standard-equipment list that includes a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, power driver’s seat, leather upholstery and dual-zone climate control.
Factory OptionsAll models offer Kia’s Dynamax AWD that includes locking differential for improved traction on slick surfaces. Beyond the powerful engine, the top-line SX Turbo includes navigation with an 8-inch touch screen, autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel. There’s no CD player with the premium 320-watt harman/kardon sound system, but its Clari-Fi technology improves the sound of digital music files. We particularly like the power hatch, which features Kia’s hands-free operation: Just stand near it when you have the key, and the hatch opens automatically.
Engine & TransmissionThe Sportage’s standard engine is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder good for 181 horsepower, which is about the norm for a compact SUV. Fuel economy, on the other hand, is far from impressive, especially the city figures. The optional 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is anything but the norm, with an impressive 240 horsepower on tap and only a slight reduction in fuel economy; it’s the engine of choice for those who can afford it. A 6-speed automatic transmission serves as the only transmission option, although every trim offers the option of front- or all-wheel drive. The Sportage is tow rated up to 2,000 pounds. 2.4-liter inline-4 181 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 175 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/30 mpg (FWD, LX), 22/29 mpg (FWD, EX), 21/25 mpg (AWD) 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 240 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm (237 horsepower for AWD models) 260 lb-ft of torque @ 1,450-3,500 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/26 mpg (FWD), 20/23 mpg (AWD)

As compact-crossover SUVs go, the 2019 Kia Sportage still has a leg up on many of its rivals. Beyond its attractive pricing, unbeatable 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and long list of standard and available equipment, the Sportage offers one of the most powerful turbocharged engines in this class. With Subaru dropping the turbocharged Forester XT and Toyota relying on the hybrid RAV4 as its performance champ, the Sportage now only has to chase down the Ford Escape and Jeep Cherokee in the horsepower wars. Of course, the Sportage also comes with a less powerful but more fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engine, the option of all-wheel drive and a host of optional driver assists, many of which are standard on the Sportage’s competition.

Driving the Used 2019 Toyota Highlander HybridWe like the Highlander for its comfort, high seating position and smooth operation. Unless you’re really pinching pennies and don’t care about meandering in the slow lane, skip the 4-cylinder that’s only available in the base Highlander. Opt instead for the V6 or the hybrid Highlander, which pairs a V6 with an electric motor. Both offer brisk acceleration, even with a car full of kids. Both are also quite fuel efficient, with the V6 returning up to 27 mpg and the hybrid 30 mpg. Whichever powertrain you choose, Toyota’s Highlander is an excellent family hauler. It has good steering feel, a good turning radius, and a comfortable yet controlled ride. While still not as athletic or fun to drive as the Mazda CX-9, the Highlander SE brings a little extra spice to the party thanks to a sport-tuned suspension.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Toyota Highlander has three rows of seats and the ability to accommodate seven or eight passengers. If you need to seat up to eight, go with the 2nd-row bench. Otherwise, there is a pair of captain’s seats available in the second row that are more comfortable but reduce total seat count to seven. Both rear rows fold nearly flat for better cargo flexibility. If you’re not using the third row on a regular basis, you’ll probably find it’s better left down, as cargo space is at a premium with it up. In front, we think the driver’s seat is above average in comfort, and depending on trim can be outfitted in leather and even offer heating and ventilation functions. Storage cubbies, cup holders and USB ports abound — all helpful for making trips less stressful. All Highlanders have a central touch screen for audio and information functionality — 6.1 inches in lower trims and eight inches in higher ones.
Exterior StylingWe generally like the Highlander’s look. It’s large but not imposing, muscular yet handsome. It has more a squared-off look vs. the rounded Honda Pilot. In this respect, the Highlander looks the part of a more traditional, slabbed SUV. Up front, it’s hard to miss that massive grille. Base models come with 18-inch wheels, while higher trims wear 19-inchers. All models except the base Highlander LE have a handy flip-up rear hatch window, which makes it easy to load and unload the rear without opening the entire tailgate. And all but base models include a power-operated tailgate.
Favorite FeaturesTOYOTA SAFETY SENSE
No matter which new Toyota Highlander you buy, it will come with this impressive suite of safety and driver-assistance features. Toyota Safety Sense will do everything from detect pedestrians and keep you within lanes to warn of a collision and even automatically apply the brakes if a collision appears imminent. Also helpful is adaptive cruise control.
DRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM
With the Highlander’s Driver Easy Speak, cries of “DON’T MAKE ME PULL THIS CAR OVER” are reduced to a mere vocal warning via an intercom system that allows the driver’s intention to be conveyed loud and clear to 3rd-row-seat occupants.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Highlander is offered in five main trims, starting with the LE. That base model is pretty basic but does include keyless entry, a total of five USB ports, the Entune infotainment system with 6.1-inch touch screen, and the Toyota Safety Sense suite of safety features. We recommend skipping that base trim for a better experience, even if it’s just one trim to LE Plus. That grants the proper V6 engine, power tailgate with flip-up hatch window, tri-zone climate control, 10-way-power driver’s seat, better-quality fabric seating, and a more robust Entune infotainment system with the larger, 8-inch screen.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, Highlander XLE models have a leather interior, navigation, moonroof, power-adjustable passenger seat, the Easy Speak intercom system, and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Highlander SE variants include a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch wheels, and darkened exterior aesthetics. Top-line Highlander Limited models include blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated and ventilated front seats, a premium JBL audio system, and standard seating for seven (2nd-row captain’s chairs). All-wheel drive is optional on all V6 models, and the Highlander can be further outfitted with a rear-seat Blu-ray entertainment system and, for Limited models, a panoramic moonroof and bird’s-eye rearview camera.
Engine & TransmissionThe Toyota Highlander offers three powertrain choices. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels (FWD) through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there’s the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, and comes standard on the Highlander hybrid. The 4-cylinder Toyota Highlander is only rated to tow 1,500 pounds, while V6 variants can pull a more robust 5,000 pounds. Note that the Highlander V6 uses an engine start/stop system to save fuel. That means it’s perfectly normal for the engine to shut off at stoplights. If that’s not your cup of tea, the system can be disabled with the press of a button.

The 2019 Toyota Highlander is among the most recommendable crossover SUVs for busy families. With three rows and seating for seven or eight passengers depending on configuration, the Highlander is roomy, versatile and easy to drive and live with. The 2019 Highlander is available in several trims, but all are exceptionally safe thanks to a robust suite of accident-avoidance and driver-assistance systems. A 4-cylinder is offered in base models, but you’re better off with the more powerful — and more efficient — V6. An impressive hybrid model is also available. Toyota’s midsize SUV remains a strong competitor to the Honda Pilot, not to mention newer competitors like the Volkswagen Atlas and Subaru Ascent. About our only qualm with the Highlander is its lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.

Driving the Used 2019 Hyundai Sonata HybridLast year, Hyundai updated the Sonata’s suspension to improve handling and reduce body roll. While the ride is firmer and better controlled, it’s not at the expense of comfort. The standard 2.4-liter engine satisfies most drivers with ample acceleration, passing power and fuel economy. The 6-speed automatic transmission may lack a few ratios compared to newer competitors, but it does a fine job of managing the power with smooth shifts. If you want a more sporting attitude, consider the 2.0-liter turbo engine in the Limited 2.0T. With 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, this engine endows the 2019 Hyundai Sonata with quick acceleration while making light work of long mountain grades. It’s mated to a different transmission, an 8-speed automatic that’s both smooth and responsive. Moreover, the 2.0T’s rack-mounted electric-assist power steering has a natural feel.
Interior ComfortThe Sonata’s interior, redesigned for 2018, carries over unchanged with intuitive controls and a raised touch screen that makes all controls easier to reach. Buttons and knobs are well organized in wide horizontal rows, with navigation and audio controls just below the screen and the climate controls falling neatly below. The handsome 3-spoke steering wheel gives the interior of the 2019 Sonata a premium look. Sport models go a step further with a flat-bottom steering wheel and cloth seats that have leather bolsters and contrast stitching.
Exterior StylingA prominent grille, sharper lines and LED running lights dominate the exterior of the 2019 Hyundai Sonata. Sport models receive a unique grille and front fascia, plus dual-exhaust tips. A panoramic sunroof is standard on the Sonata Limited; all other Sonatas are available with a conventional tilt-and-slide sunroof. A neat detail: The trunk release is now hidden in the Hyundai logo. Push the area below the ring (above the ""H"") to open the trunk. Once the lid opens, you have access to the largest trunk in the Sonata’s class.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED CABIN With standard features such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 7-inch touch screen and Bluetooth — plus options such as wireless smartphone charging, navigation, satellite radio, Blue Link telecommunications and a rear USB port — the 2019 Sonata keeps your whole crew charged, connected and caught up on social media.
 TECH PACKAGE On the Sonata Limited model, Hyundai’s Tech Package includes automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, smart cruise control (with start/stop), an electronic parking brake, a wireless phone charger, automatic high-beam assist, a mesh grille and a heated steering wheel.
Standard FeaturesThe SE, the most affordable Sonata, has cloth seats, a folding rear seat, a 7-inch touch screen, a 6-speaker audio system, Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, a rearview camera, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Sonata SEL and Sport models add a mesh grille, dual-zone climate control, a wireless phone charger and a heated steering wheel. If you order a 2019 Sonata Limited, it has all the above plus automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist and smart cruise. In addition to seven standard airbags, all 2019 Sonatas boast air conditioning, power windows, heated side mirrors, blind-spot detection (with rear cross-traffic alert) and a tilt/telescope steering wheel.
Factory OptionsAvailable features on the 2019 Hyundai Sonata include automatic high-beam headlights, 10-speaker Infinity audio, navigation, power heated/ventilated leather front seats, a heated steering wheel, and Blue Link Connected Car. LED headlights and taillights, 17- or 18-inch wheels and a hands-free smart trunk are available, as are smart cruise control, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors and lane-keep assist. The Ultimate Package on the Sonata Limited includes a panoramic sunroof, rear sunshades, an 8-inch navigation screen, real-time traffic and a 3-year complimentary trial with Hyundai’s Blue Link Guidance Package.
Engine & TransmissionThere are five drivetrain choices for the 2019 Hyundai Sonata, each with four cylinders. The standard 185-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4 gets the job done while returning good highway fuel economy. For a more spirited drive, choose the 245-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, an engine now backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. The Sonata Eco’s 1.6-liter turbo-4 puts out less horsepower (178) but more torque (195 lb-ft) than the standard 2.4, and is available only with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. EPA highway fuel economy for this 1.6-liter Eco model is an impressive 37 mpg. The Sonata Hybrid and Sonata Plug-in Hybrid remain available, each powered by a 2.0-liter gasoline engine augmented by a battery-powered electric motor. The plug-in model’s larger battery pack allows up to 27 miles of electric-only range. Of note, both are unique among hybrid sedans because they use a conventional 6-speed automatic transmission instead of the continuously variable transmissions (CVT) found in rivals.

Read Full Review","What's New?While 2019 is a carryover year, Hyundai, halfway through the 2018 model year, adjusted the content levels of the various Sonatas to make a number of desirable features available at lower or unchanged prices. Although the “+” designation of these models has been dropped for 2019, the enhancements and technology packages remain.
The midsize-sedan market is more competitive than ever, with mainstays such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord continuing to top the sales charts. The 2019 Hyundai Sonata, always a lot of car for the money, fights for its slice of the shrinking market fortified by significant product and value improvements introduced on the new “+” models that arrived midway through the 2018 model year. For 2019, the “+” moniker has been dropped, but the feature enhancements and technology packages remain. As before, Hyundai’s midsize sedan continues with naturally aspirated, turbocharged, hybrid or plug-in drivetrains.

OK, so what’s next?
I’m interested in this car. What’s for sale near me?
I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.
Then again, maybe I should be thinking about a used car.
Driving the Used 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan CargoThe Dodge Grand Caravan isn’t exactly exciting to drive, but that shouldn’t be a surprise considering the segment it’s in. With the possible exception of the Honda Odyssey, few minivans can be called all that interesting to drive, and that’s pretty much the point. These vehicles are for ferrying family and friends, not tempting fate or testing the local authorities. Those caveats out of the way, we can at least attest to the Grand Caravan minivan’s power. Its standard V6 provides good straight-line acceleration, so you needn’t fear that freeway onramp. If there’s one other endearing ride quality, it’s this family vehicle’s soft, comfortable ride. Other aspects reflect this Dodge’s age and price. It’s just not as maneuverable as its competitors, and it lacks features such as blind-spot monitoring, 360-degree cameras, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping aids and other systems that can make driving more enjoyable and all-around safer.
Interior ComfortThe Dodge Grand Caravan is limited to seating seven passengers, vs. the available eight of its rivals. That’s because even with the bench seat in the second row, there is only room for two, just like with the optional bucket seats. With either setup, the third row is a bench that accommodates up to three passengers. Again, compared to rivals, the Grand Caravan’s interior feels simplistic at best and dated at worst, but at least it’s quite functional. Highlights are its standard Stow n’ Go 2nd-row seats that fold into the floor to create a flat load space. Cargo room in general still trails that of the Honda Odyssey, though. Up front are basic controls for climate, and a standard 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system. As for interior colors, they are limited to black or gray.
Exterior StylingStyling of the Dodge Grand Caravan might be called “conservative” by an optimist or “plain” by a pessimist. Either way, it’s safe to say it doesn’t have the stylistic flair of the latest Honda Odyssey or Chrysler Pacifica. Your eyes will know if they like it when they see it, and if you’re not trying to make a fashion statement but simply transport your loved ones in a new and roomy vehicle, then this Dodge can fit the bill. Basic models have manual-sliding side doors and manual tailgate, but these can all be power-operated if you’re willing to spend extra cash on the top-line SXT model. No matter which trim you go with, the only wheel size available is 17 inches.
Favorite Features3.6-LITER V6 ENGINE
This V6 has well-served a variety of Dodge and Chrysler vehicles, and it impresses here again in the Grand Caravan. It earns a respectable 25 mpg on the highway, and is even rated to tow 3,600 pounds.
LOW PRICE
For many new-car buyers, the Dodge Grand Caravan’s biggest appeal is its price. Starting well under $28,000, it is the least expensive minivan in its segment.
Standard FeaturesThe 2019 Grand Caravan minivan comes in three trims: SE, SE Plus and the top-line SXT. The least expensive Dodge minivan, the Grand Caravan SE, is pretty basic, with a urethane steering wheel, manual-adjust cloth seats and steel wheel covers. It does at least have 3-zone climate control, rearview camera, auto-dimming rearview mirror and the Stow n’ Go seats. The basic infotainment system is a 6.5-inch touch-screen unit with CD/DVD player, radio and hard-disc drive for storing music. Unlike rival minivans, no version of the Grand Caravan offers Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration.
Factory OptionsStepping up to the mid-trim Grand Caravan SE Plus adds fog lights, aluminum-alloy wheels, upgraded cloth upholstery, and voice-operated infotainment system. This trim also grants the Blacktop Package, which adds darkened aesthetics for a more aggressive character. The most-outfitted Grand Caravan is the SXT, which includes power-operated tailgate and side doors, automatic headlights, 2nd-row bucket seats (optional on other trims), and power-adjustable driver’s seat. The Grand Caravan can be further outfitted with a navigation system, and in the SXT, leather seating and heated steering wheel, 2nd-row window shades, universal garage-door opener and heated front seats. A DVD system with 2nd-row screen and a pair of wireless headphones is available on all trims.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan is powered by a 3.6-liter V6 engine good for 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Known as the Pentastar, it’s a laudable engine, delivering smooth power and pretty good fuel economy. The engine is paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission that delivers smooth shift action and, unlike some other transmissions in other vehicles, doesn’t have the annoying characteristic of continually “hunting” for the correct gear. Finally, the V6 is E85-compatible, so it can operate on blends of gasoline and ethanol. The Grand Caravan is front-wheel drive, just like all of its rivals except the Toyota Sienna, which offers all-wheel drive.

Like a determined old soldier, the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan marches on alongside newer and more sophisticated minivans such as the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona, and its own corporate cousin, the Chrysler Pacifica. Yet there’s a reason the Grand Caravan remains a best-seller: a sub-"

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. The starter and alternator functions are combined into one unit, and the engine is equipped with an Auto Stop/Start feature. The hybrid can travel on pure electric power for short distances at speeds below 25 mph.

Models equipped with navigation now feature the Aha infotainment app.
If there is one thing Subaru owners love about their vehicles it is ground clearance. So, when Subaru decided to make a new SUV from its popular Impreza hatchback, they started by raising it to a whopping 8.7 inches. Toss in a little cladding, some cool colors and snappy rims, and you’ve got the 2014 XV Crosstrek.

Most buyers will prefer an automatic transmission, which is $800 extra. The more recommendable Jetta SE starts at $23,005. At the top, the Jetta SEL Premium runs just under $28,000. At these prices, the Jetta is competitive with the roughly 10 other rivals in its segment, slightly undercutting the Honda Civic and slotting above the starting prices of the Kia Forte, Mazda3, Subaru Impreza, and Nissan Sentra. The Jetta GLI’s price spans from $26,890 to just over $30,000, which puts its starting price just above that of the Honda Civic Si. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to get an idea of what others in your area are paying for their new car. While this is an all-new model, for reference the Jetta’s resale value has traditionally trailed that of rivals like the Honda Civic, Subaru Impreza, and Mazda3.
Driving the Used 2019 Volkswagen JettaThe standard 2019 VW Jetta has lost a couple of things in its current form vs. the 2018 model, but the good news is, it’s still a nimble driver. In the missing column is the option for a higher-powered (170 horsepower) 1.8-liter engine, and a multilink rear suspension. For 2019, the Jetta uses a 147-horsepower 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, while the former suspension has been swapped for a simpler torsion beam. Despite this, the new Jetta feels lively and agile. Acceleration is peppy, especially in Sport mode, and the handling retains the European feel that has been associated with the Jetta for decades. By “European feel,” we mean that it is both agile and fun in corners while, still proving a taut yet comfortable ride on the highway. The new 8-speed automatic transmission is a high point. Shifts are smooth, and the system eagerly kicks down gears when needed, such as for high-speed passing. Manual transmission fans take note: The new 6-speed is a joy to use. It’s easy, light and engaging. The downside is it’s only offered on the base Jetta S.
 For those with slightly bigger budgets, the also-new 2019 Jetta GLI rectifies all that’s missing from the standard model. Its 2.0-liter turbo engine offers plenty of oomph with 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while its rear suspension is a more sophisticated multilink setup. Moreover, all models come standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic as an option. The result is a superbly enjoyable performance sedan. The 2019 Jetta GLI is both fun to fling around corners, yet also comfortable enough for everyday commuting. The GLI is offered in three trims, but we particularly like the midtrim 35th Anniversary Edition as it’s the only one to get the DCC adaptive damping suspension with a “comfort” mode.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Jetta’s 5-passenger cabin retains its clean Euro simplicity. Controls for audio, climate and the like are kept to a minimum and are easy to see and reach. All 2019 Jetta models feature a central touch screen that handles infotainment. Lower trims use a 6.5-inch display, while higher ones have a better-looking 8-inch unit. Interior room is impressive for a compact car, and matches or nearly matches that of the lauded Honda Civic. Basic cloth covers the interior of S trims. SE, R-Line and SEL trims get V-Tex leatherette, and the topline SEL Premium has real leather.
At 14.1 cubic feet, the trunk is impressively large. Furthermore, standard 60/40-split rear seats add cargo-carrying practicality. One thing we found odd is the shelf behind the rear seats. It slopes upward, limiting rear visibility, and is made of inexpensive-feeling plastic that can cause glare on bright days.
In addition to GLI-specific interior elements, the Jetta GLI models come standard with adjustable, 10-color ambient lighting that’s optional in the regular model.
Exterior StylingThe Volkswagen Jetta has long stood out by not exactly standing out. You won’t find super flashy design or some trend-setting style element here. We don’t think this is a bad thing, especially if you like clean and classic lines that are almost certain to hold up well over time. Still, our eyes see definite improvements in this slightly larger Jetta vs. the outgoing model. The wraparound grille is handsome without being overt. One of the most interesting features — and challenging from a metalworking perspective – are the creases that run nearly the length of each side. The R-Line model kicks up the sporty factor with a unique grille and bumper, and black side-mirror caps. As with the SEL Premium, the R-Line also comes with fog lights.
 The sportier Jetta GLI is a wolf in sheep’s clothes, looking very similar to standard Jettas. Distinguishing marks include a 0.6-inch-lower stance, unique front end with a red accent stripe across the grille, and standard 18-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesDIGITAL COCKPITCall it trickle-down technology. This digital dashboard that debuted on VW’s luxury-brand cousin, Audi, a few years ago can now be had on a mainstream Jetta. It replaces the traditional gauges with a slick, 10.25-inch configurable screen that can display navigation maps, audio info, and, of course, speed/rpm data.
BEATS AUDIOIn another first for the Jetta, Volkswagen has partnered with Beats Audio for its premium sound system. While some of Beats’ previous systems were bass-heavy, this new setup sounds more refined and pleasing across the entire frequency spectrum.
Standard FeaturesIf you can only afford a Jetta S base model, you’ll still get a decently equipped car. Included are the basics like air conditioning, power windows/doorlocks, and a turbocharged engine, cruise control, LED headlights, 16-inch wheels, rearview camera, and an infotainment system that bundles a 6.5-inch touch screen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto/MirrorLink smartphone connectivity, 4-speaker AM/FM radio, a USB port, and Bluetooth connectivity. An automatic transmission, which most people will prefer, is $800 extra. If you can afford the roughly $23,000 starting price, we recommend stepping up to at least the Jetta SE. It is better equipped with an automatic transmission, panoramic moonroof, leatherette interior, heated front seats, keyless access with push-button start, and dual-zone climate control. Moreover, it includes safety features like blind-spot monitoring and forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking.
 Jetta GLI models are offered in three trims: Base, 35th anniversary, and Autobahn. In addition to its performance hardware, the GLI also includes heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, and active safety features of the Jetta SE.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, the new Jetta R-Line adds the VW GTI-derived XDS electronic front differential for better handling, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and 2-tone seating. Stepping up to the SEL grants the Digital Cockpit (see Favorite Features), upgraded 8-inch central touch screen, Beats premium audio, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, auto-dimming rearview mirror, LED projector headlights, and rain-sensing windshield wipers. At the top, the SEL Premium includes leather interior, navigation, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, 8-way power driver’s seat, and heated steering wheel.
 On the Jetta GLI, the 35th Anniversary Edition includes the adaptive-damping suspension and unique aesthetics. The topline Jetta GLI Autobahn has ventilated front seats, the Beats audio system, power driver’s seat, 8-inch touch-screen system with a CD player (it’s in the glovebox), and the Digital Cockpit. Autobahn models of the 2019 Jetta GLI with the DSG automatic transmission also get remote start.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2019 Jetta is powered by a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, mostly carried over from the previous generation. It is down a few horsepower, but gains efficiency, attaining the coveted 40-mpg highway fuel-economy rating. Transmission choices are a 6-speed manual that’s standard on base models or an 8-speed automatic that’s optional on the base trim and standard on every other. The automatic features an idle start/stop system that cuts power at stoplights to save fuel. Restarts are quite smooth, and the system can be switched off with the press of a button by the gear lever. Unlike some other turbo engines, this one runs fine on regular unleaded gasoline instead of the pricier premium stuff.
The 2019 Jetta GLI performance model gets a more potent turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that makes 228 horsepower. In addition to extra horsepower and torque, it features other go-quicker components like a multilink rear suspension and limited-slip front differential, and excellent brakes from the high-performance Golf R. All models of the Jetta GLI come with a 6-speed manual transmission as standard or optional 7-speed DSG automatic with the idle start/stop system. It, too, runs fine on regular unleaded. 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4147 horsepower @ 5,000 rpm184 lb-ft of torque @ 1,400 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/40 mpg 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Jetta GLI)228 horsepower @ 5,000 rpm258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,700 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/32 mpg

Driving the Used 2019 Chevrolet SuburbanDespite its vast size, the 2019 Chevy Suburban is an impressive vehicle both on long stretches of highway and curving mountain roads. It’s not a sports car by any means, but Chevrolet’s masterful working of the Suburban’s suspension, engine and transmission combine to create a 3-ton SUV that rides and handles very much like a large luxury sedan, albeit with a bit more height and a lot more weight. Rounding tight curves at medium to high speeds produces minimal lean and roll, and the Suburban’s steering feels tight and direct, with just the right amount of weight applied to the thick-rimmed steering wheel. Premier and RST trims employ magnetically adjustable shocks capable of adjusting to varying road conditions in a fraction of a second. The standard Suburban is pulled by an impressive 5.3-liter V8 good for 355 horsepower and a respectable 23-mpg highway fuel-economy rating, while the RST elevates both power and performance, delivering 420 horsepower through an advanced 10-speed automatic transmission.
Interior ComfortThe 2019 Suburban’s upscale interior grabs your attention from the moment you step inside; its artful shapes, high-end materials and excellent fit-and-finish seem more appropriate for a luxury sedan than a full-size SUV. The 2nd-row’s comfy seats recline but, unfortunately, don’t slide fore and aft. The third row has enough foot- and legroom for adults, at least for shorter trips, and kids will be fine. A high cargo floor provides space for the flat-fold 3rd-row seats, but that space is not wasted — under the floor is a handy hidden storage area.
Exterior StylingThe Suburban’s exterior shares nothing of design or components with its Silverado pickup-truck counterpart. Chevy’s exterior designers had a lot of space at their disposal and used it well; this big SUV has a presence that is decidedly commanding. Long, flowing lines emphasize the Suburban’s considerable length instead of hiding it, and the broad front face owns the traffic lane. Dimensionally, the 2019 Suburban is about the same size as all those versions of years past, but then, when you’re talking about full-size SUVs, an inch here or there doesn’t make much of a difference.
Favorite FeaturesSUPERB INTERIOR Wide supportive seats, a handsome dash and meticulous attention to detail make the 2019 Chevrolet Suburban’s interior feel more like riding in a high-priced luxury SUV. The cavernous interior includes ample head- and legroom, plus loads of space for cargo, even with the 3rd-row seat in place.
 REAR SEAT REMINDER With so much on our minds today it’s easy to get distracted when exiting a vehicle. The Suburban’s Rear Seat Reminder helps mitigate a potentially dangerous situation by alerting an exiting driver to check the rear seats for pets, valuables or a sleeping child.
Standard FeaturesStandard on all Suburbans is the 5.3-liter V8 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission and a cavernous interior. The base-level LS trim has cloth seats, automatic climate control, rear parking sensors and the standard Chevrolet MyLink 8-inch diagonal touch screen that includes Bluetooth streaming audio, apps and other features. The mid-range LT trim has forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and the availability of features not offered on the LS. The Premier models add rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot alerts, up-level audio, heated and cooled seats, programmable power liftgate, 20-inch wheels and a boatload of other items.
Factory OptionsThe Suburban’s available-equipment list is extensive. Among the choices: Order the LS trim level with the front bench seat and Chevy’s biggest can haul nine people to the movies. Any trim can be equipped with the Driver Alert Package that adds low-speed forward automatic braking, IntelliBeam automatic high beams, lane-keep assist, driver-alert seat and power-adjustable pedals. For the LT version, we like the exceptionally comprehensive Luxury Package that adds many of the Premier’s luxury touches, and the Sun, Entertainment and Destinations Package that bundles navigation, a Blu-ray rear-seat entertainment system, a power sunroof and many other items.
Engine & TransmissionChevy’s standard powertrain for the Suburban is a fine one: the very well-proven 5.3-liter 355-horsepower V8 with a 6-speed automatic. The 5.3 makes plenty of power, cranks out 383 lb-ft of torque, features direct fuel injection and Active Cylinder Management and, if not a fuel-economy leader, delivers efficiency that is at least reasonable, considering the big Suburban’s muscular capabilities. The smooth 6-speed automatic does a good job of keeping the engine in the best part of its power range and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optionally available. Maximum towing capacity with 2-wheel drive (2WD) is 8,300 pounds, so the 5.3 is more than willing and able. Opt for the new RST Performance Package and you’ll get a 6.2-liter V8, 10-speed automatic transmission and a sport-tuned suspension.
5.3-liter V8 355 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm 383 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/22 mpg (2WD), 14/21 mpg (4WD)
 6.2-liter V8 420 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm 460 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/23 mpg (2WD), 14/20 mpg (4WD)
Read Full Review","What's New?For 2019, the Suburban gains a new RST (Rally Sport Truck) Performance Package that includes a 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8, 10-speed automatic transmission and a performance-calibrated version of GM’s Magnetic Ride Control. Options for the RST include a Borla exhaust and a Brembo brake kit.
Now in the fifth year of its 11th generation, the 2019 Chevrolet Suburban may be an old-timer, but it’s definitely not getting old. This popular full-size SUV continues to serve big families, offering an enormous cabin, a powerful V8 and so many features and options it’s hard to keep track. Ford’s new Expedition Max is close on the Suburban’s bumper, however, with an additional 1,000-pound towing capacity and a level rear floor featuring flush-folding seats. Still, the Suburban’s upscale interior and choice of available V8 engines hold powerful sway over some buyers. With no extended versions of the Nissan Armada or Toyota Sequoia, outside the Expedition the only other Suburban competitors are its corporate twins, the GMC Yukon XL and Cadillac Escalade ESV.

Driving the Used 2019 Toyota YarisWith only 106 horses under the hood, the Yaris won’t be winning many street races. Then again, this is a smaller car with not a lot of weight to move, so it doesn’t feel sticky-slow, either. Most buyers will opt for the automatic transmission, a refined 6-speed that matches well with this engine. If you’re willing to put in the effort or simply like more engagement, the 6-speed manual transmission is easy to use and will help you wring a bit more out of the Yaris’ little 4-cylinder engine. The Yaris will tolerate being pushed in corners and may just make you smile a bit doing it. At higher speeds the cabin can be noisy. This is a subcompact sedan, after all. It is fine for shorter, in-city jaunts, but if you do a lot of highway driving or have a longer commute, you’ll appreciate stepping up a size or two, even if it’s just to a Corolla.
Interior ComfortThe Toyota Yaris’ cabin looks and feels more sophisticated than its entry-level status would suggest. As this is basically a Mazda, this is a welcome surprise, as Toyota’s partner in this vehicle has been designing some fine cabins the past few years. Although the average American might find them a bit snug, the Yaris’ front seats are supportive. Rear legroom is adequate for this class, and at nearly 13.5 cubic feet, the trunk is roomy. Standard 60/40-split-folding rear seats add to the utility factor. The new, top-line XLE trim grants upgraded materials that include leather-trimmed steering wheel and Leatherette seats.
Exterior StylingIf you mistake the Yaris’ swoopy, stylistic lines for that of a Mazda, you’d have good reason: The Yaris wears a Toyota badge for sure, but it is based on the Mazda2 built by the smaller Japanese automaker. Mazda’s current design philosophy is quite appealing to our eyes, and we think it benefits the Toyota in this joint venture (the Mazda2 sedan is not sold in the U.S.). The Yaris does feature Toyota’s massive grille, a trapezoidal maw up front that is updated with a honeycomb insert for 2019. Your eyes will know if they like it or not. Base L and mid-trim LE models have halogen headlights, while the top-line XLE has brighter LEDs with automatic on/off. Base Yaris L trims have 15-inch steel wheels, while the LE and XLE wear nicer 16-inch alloys.
Favorite FeaturesTOUCH OR REMOTE-CONTROLLED INFOTAINMENT The Yaris’ menu-driven infotainment system uses a 7-inch touch-screen display for audio, media, navigation and mobile apps. Once in motion, the touch screen is locked out leaving control in the hands of a rotary push control knob located directly where the driver’s right hand naturally comes to rest.
 LOW-SPEED PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM Effective at speeds up to 18 mph, the Yaris’ low-speed pre-collision warning system scans the road ahead for potential trouble and alerts the driver. If a collision seems imminent, the system can activate the brakes and bring the car to a stop.
Standard FeaturesFor 2019, the Toyota Yaris sedan comes in three trims, rather than the single one for last year’s model. At its most basic, the Yaris L includes the basics like power windows and door locks, 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, push-button start, and an infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen, AM/FM/satellite/HD Radio, two USB ports and Bluetooth streaming. Unlike rivals such as those from Kia and Hyundai, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is not available on the Yaris. The Yaris’ safety features include six airbags and the low-speed pre-collision system, which can automatically apply the brakes at speeds of 18 mph or less.
Factory OptionsAn automatic transmission is optional on the L and LE (and standard on the XLE). Otherwise, most major options come by climbing trims. Yaris LE models add smart-key keyless entry, 16-inch wheels, fog lights, heated outside mirrors and a rear spoiler. The well-equipped Yaris is the XLE, which has Leatherette upholstery, genuine leather-covered steering wheel, automatic LED headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and automatic climate control. Opting for the XLE also gets you the automatic transmission as standard. All models can have their infotainment system upgraded to include navigation for about $400.
Engine & TransmissionThe lone engine offered in the 2019 Yaris sedan is a Mazda-sourced 1.5-liter, direct-injected 4-cylinder that makes 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. It drives the front wheels through a standard 6-speed manual or an optional 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is predictably impressive, scoring up to the 40-mpg mark with the automatic and an impressive 39 mpg via the manual. 1.5-liter inline-4 106 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 103 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/39 mpg (manual), 32/40 mpg (automatic)

Driving the Used 2019 Hyundai SonataLast year, Hyundai updated the Sonata’s suspension to improve handling and reduce body roll. While the ride is firmer and better controlled, it’s not at the expense of comfort. The standard 2.4-liter engine satisfies most drivers with ample acceleration, passing power and fuel economy. The 6-speed automatic transmission may lack a few ratios compared to newer competitors, but it does a fine job of managing the power with smooth shifts. If you want a more sporting attitude, consider the 2.0-liter turbo engine in the Limited 2.0T. With 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, this engine endows the 2019 Hyundai Sonata with quick acceleration while making light work of long mountain grades. It’s mated to a different transmission, an 8-speed automatic that’s both smooth and responsive. Moreover, the 2.0T’s rack-mounted electric-assist power steering has a natural feel.
Interior ComfortThe Sonata’s interior, redesigned for 2018, carries over unchanged with intuitive controls and a raised touch screen that makes all controls easier to reach. Buttons and knobs are well organized in wide horizontal rows, with navigation and audio controls just below the screen and the climate controls falling neatly below. The handsome 3-spoke steering wheel gives the interior of the 2019 Sonata a premium look. Sport models go a step further with a flat-bottom steering wheel and cloth seats that have leather bolsters and contrast stitching.
Exterior StylingA prominent grille, sharper lines and LED running lights dominate the exterior of the 2019 Hyundai Sonata. Sport models receive a unique grille and front fascia, plus dual-exhaust tips. A panoramic sunroof is standard on the Sonata Limited; all other Sonatas are available with a conventional tilt-and-slide sunroof. A neat detail: The trunk release is now hidden in the Hyundai logo. Push the area below the ring (above the ""H"") to open the trunk. Once the lid opens, you have access to the largest trunk in the Sonata’s class.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED CABIN With standard features such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 7-inch touch screen and Bluetooth — plus options such as wireless smartphone charging, navigation, satellite radio, Blue Link telecommunications and a rear USB port — the 2019 Sonata keeps your whole crew charged, connected and caught up on social media.
 TECH PACKAGE On the Sonata Limited model, Hyundai’s Tech Package includes automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, smart cruise control (with start/stop), an electronic parking brake, a wireless phone charger, automatic high-beam assist, a mesh grille and a heated steering wheel.
Standard FeaturesThe SE, the most affordable Sonata, has cloth seats, a folding rear seat, a 7-inch touch screen, a 6-speaker audio system, Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, a rearview camera, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Sonata SEL and Sport models add a mesh grille, dual-zone climate control, a wireless phone charger and a heated steering wheel. If you order a 2019 Sonata Limited, it has all the above plus automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist and smart cruise. In addition to seven standard airbags, all 2019 Sonatas boast air conditioning, power windows, heated side mirrors, blind-spot detection (with rear cross-traffic alert) and a tilt/telescope steering wheel.
Factory OptionsAvailable features on the 2019 Hyundai Sonata include automatic high-beam headlights, 10-speaker Infinity audio, navigation, power heated/ventilated leather front seats, a heated steering wheel, and Blue Link Connected Car. LED headlights and taillights, 17- or 18-inch wheels and a hands-free smart trunk are available, as are smart cruise control, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors and lane-keep assist. The Ultimate Package on the Sonata Limited includes a panoramic sunroof, rear sunshades, an 8-inch navigation screen, real-time traffic and a 3-year complimentary trial with Hyundai’s Blue Link Guidance Package.
Engine & TransmissionThere are five drivetrain choices for the 2019 Hyundai Sonata, each with four cylinders. The standard 185-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4 gets the job done while returning good highway fuel economy. For a more spirited drive, choose the 245-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, an engine now backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. The Sonata Eco’s 1.6-liter turbo-4 puts out less horsepower (178) but more torque (195 lb-ft) than the standard 2.4, and is available only with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. EPA highway fuel economy for this 1.6-liter Eco model is an impressive 37 mpg. The Sonata Hybrid and Sonata Plug-in Hybrid remain available, each powered by a 2.0-liter gasoline engine augmented by a battery-powered electric motor. The plug-in model’s larger battery pack allows up to 27 miles of electric-only range. Of note, both are unique among hybrid sedans because they use a conventional 6-speed automatic transmission instead of the continuously variable transmissions (CVT) found in rivals.
2.4-liter inline-4 (SE, SEL, Sport and Limited) 185 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 178 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/35 mpg (SE), 25/33 mpg (SEL, Sport, Limited)

Read Full Review","What's New?While 2019 is a carryover year, Hyundai, halfway through the 2018 model year, adjusted the content levels of the various Sonatas to make a number of desirable features available at lower or unchanged prices. Although the “+” designation of these models has been dropped for 2019, the enhancements and technology packages remain.
The midsize-sedan market is more competitive than ever, with mainstays such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord continuing to top the sales charts. The 2019 Hyundai Sonata, always a lot of car for the money, fights for its slice of the shrinking market fortified by significant product and value improvements introduced on the new “+” models that arrived midway through the 2018 model year. For 2019, the “+” moniker has been dropped, but the feature enhancements and technology packages remain.

There’s more interior room, a longer wheelbase and more features, including Apple CarPlay.
When it comes to big, roomy and dependable family sedans, it just doesn’t get any better than the 2019 Toyota Avalon. All-new this year, the Avalon is offered with a potent V6 or fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain, an impressive list of standard luxury and safety features and a cavernous rear seat providing even the tallest passengers a comfortable perch. The ride is improved over last year’s model, with better handling and steering feedback, not to mention a quieter cabin. Although many competitors like the Buick LaCrosse, Chrysler 300, Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus are being phased out of existence, the Avalon still faces tough competition from cars like the Kia Cadenza, Kia Stinger and Dodge Charger, the latter two offered with a feature missing from the Avalon’s roster: all-wheel drive.
Used 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid PricingThe 2019 Toyota Avalon XLE carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $36,480 including the $930 destination charge. The XSE pushes the price up to $38,980, the Limited to $42,780 and the Touring to $43,180. The Avalon Hybrid XLE Hybrid starts at $37,480, the Hybrid XSE at $39,980 and the Hybrid Limited at $43,780. For the gasoline-powered models, that’s more expensive than the Buick LaCrosse, Chevy Impala or Ford Taurus, but in line with the Kia Cadenza, Chrysler 300 and Nissan Maxima. The hybrid models are a bit more expensive than a comparable Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, but really have no other competition in this category. Before you set out to purchase your 2019 Avalon, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their car. As for resale, the Avalon holds its value far better than the Buick LaCrosse, Chrysler 300 or Ford Taurus, and even better than the Kia Cadenza, Lincoln MKZ Hybrid and Nissan Maxima.
Driving the Used 2019 Toyota Avalon HybridFor 2019, the Avalon gains a number of improvements that make the overall driving experience more enjoyable. Output from the 3.5-liter V6 is increased to 301 horsepower, while the hybrid now touts 215 horsepower. The V6 is teamed to a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic, while the hybrid retains its continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Thanks to a new multi-link rear suspension and firmer suspension components, we found the Avalon to be surprisingly agile for its size, with precise steering and minimal lean in sharp turns. Yet, for all its improvements, the Avalon retains its luxury-car smooth ride, exceptionally quiet cabin and unflappable stability.
Of the four available trims, the Touring is the most desirable thanks to its steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, Active Noise Cancellation and Engine Sound Enhancement. The Touring’s Adaptive Variable Suspension continuously varies the shock absorbers according to road conditions up to 50 times per second. The Touring also features a Sport + mode that enhances both engine and suspension performance. Not to be forgotten, the Avalon Hybrid isn’t quite as quick or precise as its gasoline counterpart, and there is no Touring trim, but for a hybrid sedan, we think most will find the ride and handling more than acceptable.
Interior ComfortInside the 2019 Toyota Avalon you’ll discover more than just spacious accommodations for five adults. There’s a newfound elegance in the design enhanced by soft-touch materials, leather or SofTex trimmed seats and a robust standard-equipment list. The dash is particularly handsome, with a squared-off instrument cluster binnacle and protruding shelf vaguely reminiscent of early Toyota designs from the 1980s and 1990s. The wide center console flows elegantly upward, carrying with it the ventilation controls and a massive 9-inch infotainment touch screen that acts as the nerve center for the most necessary controls. Ice-blue backlighting illuminates buttons on the dash and steering wheel, as well as recessed binnacles in the dash and foot-wells. We’re happy to report that Apple CarPlay has finally found its way into the Avalon’s cabin, but Android Auto is still waiting for an invite.
Exterior StylingFor this remake, Toyota definitely brought the sexy out. The 2019 Avalon is new from tip to tailpipes, and its more aggressive look is clearly an attempt to draw in younger buyers not interested in SUVs or wagons. From its massive wide-mouth grille to its distinctive character lines, the Avalon is all about impressing. There’s plenty of glass for excellent 360-visibility, and the four corners are high enough to easily figure out where the car is, regardless of the driver’s position and seat height.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD TOYOTA SAFTEY SENSE PLUS (T-SSP)
When it comes to safety, Toyota is all-in. That’s why it includes the comprehensive Safety Sense Plus suite of driver assists as standard equipment on every Avalon. The system includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam assist and lane-departure warning and assist.
TOURING TRIM
The Touring trim is an overall excellent choice. You’ll still get the comfortable ride and feature-rich content of the Limited and XSE trims, but with so much more in the way of performance and driving enjoyment. If you can live without the Limited’s leather seating, the Touring is the way to go.
Standard FeaturesThe most basic trim is the XLE, but its content is far from Spartan. Standard equipment includes 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights, Smart Key entry with push-button start, 8-way-power front seats with 2-way lumbar, SofTex seating (faux leather), heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 3-drive-mode selector (Eco, Normal, Sport), 8-speaker Entune audio with Apple CarPlay and a 9-inch touch screen, five USB ports (three up front, two in the rear), blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert, 10 airbags including rear side-impact airbags and front-seat knee airbags as well as the Toyota Safety Sense Plus system (see Favorite Features).
Factory OptionsOptions increase as you climb the trim ladder. Opt for the XSE and you’ll get a few more features like 19-inch wheels, Qi wireless charging and a power sunroof. The Limited trim nets leather seating, heated and ventilated front seats, a power sunroof, 4-way-power lumbar support, heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, 10-inch color head-up display and a 14-speaker JBL audio system with navigation. The Touring is similar to the Limited, only without the leather and with a more advanced drive-mode system, Active Noise Cancellation and an adaptive suspension. Packaged options include the JBL audio system, Qi wireless charging pad, Bird’s Eye View camera and Intelligent Clearance Sonar with cross-traffic braking. The hybrid trims largely mirror their gasoline counterparts and come in XLE, XSE and Limited trims.
Engine & TransmissionWith the 2019 Toyota Avalon, you can have a really powerful car with good fuel economy, or really impressive fuel economy with good power. The standard Avalon comes with a 301-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid employs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with two electric motor generators and a CVT. Combined output is up 15 horsepower to 215 this year, while fuel economy both city and highway improves by three miles per gallon, respectively.

ConsThe Chevy Silverado is resolutely mainstream, so if you’re looking for advanced powertrain and construction, the F-150 and its aluminum structure and turbocharged V6 engines are more cutting-edge.

On the other end of that scale, a 4WD Crew Cab, standard-box High Country Silverado is just under the $57,000 mark, and that’s before you start adding options. Of course, you can get pretty much anything you want for considerably less, or more.

Best Deals on a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado for March
The downside of owning a pickup truck like the 2018 Silverado, is people will constantly be wanting to borrow it. Moving day is a popular reason, but so is making a run to the home-improvement store. Buying a Silverado is like moving to South Florida, suddenly everybody wants to be your friend. People you haven’t heard from in years will suddenly have your number. You will struggle to adapt to your newfound popularity. But, there won’t be much struggling to opt for certified pre-owned (CPO).
CPO Silverados are the cream of the 2018 Silverado crop. These lower-mileage models not only have clean vehicle-history reports, but they have been give the seal of approval after a 172-point inspection by a trained technician. Because Chevy has certified them, it provides them with extra factory-backed warranty coverage.
That’s not all, though. Chevy also beefs up the deal with some added-value perks like two free scheduled-maintenance visits and a free OnStar trial.
While we can’t guarantee a jump in your popularity once you give that CPO 2018 Silverado a new home, but Chevy does guarantee your satisfaction through its upgraded CPO-warranty protection and additional CPO benefits.
The best deals in brief

CPO Sierras are the best of the best GMC Sierra models available, having passed a rigid inspection. They also come with extra warranties and several other added-value benefits.

Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabThe idea of trucks being uncomfortable and noisy is as outdated as bipartisan legislation. The 2018 Chevrolet Silverado glides along the highway, quietly despite its boxy design, and smoothly despite its old-school leaf-spring rear suspension. The Silverado’s suspension soaks up big dips with ease, although that same capability also means it’s sometimes floaty off-road or around town. The steering on the other hand feels nicely weighted, and with enough angle that the Silverado is more maneuverable than you might think. Of the three engines available, we recommend the 5.3-liter V8. The V6 offers better fuel economy but feels sluggish, while the 6.2-liter V8’s extra power isn’t enough to offset its fuel-economy hit. The 8-speed automatic translates to fuel economy that’s close to the EcoBoost V6 in the Ford F-150, but unfortunately throttle response feels particularly lazy.
Interior ComfortBase models of the 2018 Chevy Silverado benefit from the same sensible layout, ample storage, and nicely textured plastics as the rest of the lineup. That’s not to say there aren’t benefits for paying more; move up the trim ladder and you’ll get even higher-end materials, and the top-of-the-line High Country lays on the luxury nice and thick. Beyond creature comforts, there are three cab sizes to choose from: traditional regular cab, a double cab with some extra space behind the front seats, or the crew cab, which can seat up to six in surprising comfort.
Exterior StylingLike any modern truck, the Chevy Silverado boasts rugged and distinctive exterior styling. Yet it doesn’t go overboard, instead presenting a relatively conservative face to the world compared to its sometimes garish competitors. Granted, the Silverado LTZ grille is a big chunk o’ chrome, but the rest of the lineup is more tasteful and subdued. The High Country offers a more luxurious take on the full-size pickup, and it looks the part with generous — but tasteful — uses of chrome. Unlike the F-150, the Silverado doesn’t offer a built-in stepladder, but it does offer an optional rear-bumper step.
Favorite Features12,500-POUND TRAILERING RATING
If you order a Silverado Crew Cab with the NHT max towing package, you’ll get best-in-class towing capability of 12,500 pounds. That bests the Tundra, F-150, Ram…everyone.
BUILT-IN WI-FI CONNECTIVITY
Chevrolet will bill the Silverado’s Wi-Fi capability as a feature for workers on the job site, and it’s certainly useful there. But we know what it’s really for: taking the Silverado on a road trip, and keeping the kids occupied with their tablets as you travel.
Standard FeaturesNewly standard on the 2018 Chevy Silverado are a rearview camera and a tire-fill alert that honks the horn to tell you when you’ve reached the right inflation pressure. Otherwise things aren’t much different from last year. The basic Silverado WT — that stands for Work Truck — comes with air conditioning, power windows, cruise control and AM/FM audio system with a new 7.0-inch display, auxiliary jack and SD card. Also standard are multiple USB inputs, Teen Driver safe-driving system, projector-beam headlights, LED accents, and the CornerStep cutout on the rear bumper to make it easier to access the truck’s bed.
Factory OptionsLike most full-size pickups, there is a range of engine, cab, bed and drivetrain options to choose from. Besides that are multiple trim levels. If you’re looking for luxury, start with the High Country, which comes standard with the big V8, leather upholstery, navigation, Apple CarPlay, a premium audio system, and more. There are multiple other packages, such as the Midnight Edition, which comes in a cool all-black theme, or the Z71 off-road edition, which tones down the chrome grille. One option that isn’t available at any price is push-button ignition, odd since it’s available in the Silverado-based Tahoe SUV.
Engine & TransmissionThere are three engine selections for the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado. The base engine is a 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6, which leads in fuel economy, but seriously lags the others in horsepower; skip it. At the other end is the 6.2-liter V8, which handily out-powers everything else, but fuel economy suffers more than we prefer. The Goldilocks setup is the 5.3-liter V8, which offers more power than the V6, but better fuel economy than the bigger V8. All engines are available with 4-wheel drive (4WD) instead of the standard 2-wheel-drive (2WD) setup, and the standard 6-speed automatic gets supplanted with an 8-speed automatic with the 6.2-liter V8 and 5.3-liter V8 LTZ. Everything runs on regular unleaded, with the V6 and 5.3-liter V8 capable of running on E85 ethanol blend.

The mild-hybrid eAssist package is now available nationwide on LTZ and LT models, the tire-pressure-monitoring system includes a fill alert that tells you when you’ve reached the right pressure, and the rearview camera is now standard.
The 2018 Chevrolet Silverado brings tastefully conservative good looks, a range of engines and powertrain choices, and excellent towing and hauling capabilities to one of the toughest markets in the U.S. Chevrolet’s reputation over the decades has made its Silverado pickup one of the top sellers, coming in at a perpetual number two behind the Ford F-150.

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. The starter and alternator functions are combined into one unit, and the engine is equipped with an Auto Stop/Start feature. The hybrid can travel on pure electric power for short distances at speeds below 25 mph.

Using the same 2.0-liter engine only with slightly higher compression and an electric motor assist, the XV Crosstrek Hybrid delivers 12 additional horsepower and 18 more lb-ft of torque, plus an additional 4 mpg in city driving. Models equipped with navigation now feature the Aha infotainment app.
If there is one thing Subaru owners love about their vehicles it is ground clearance. So, when Subaru decided to make a new SUV from its popular Impreza hatchback, they started by raising it to a whopping 8.7 inches. Toss in a little cladding, some cool colors and snappy rims, and you’ve got the 2014 XV Crosstrek. Although not terribly powerful, the XV Crosstrek is easy on your fuel budget, and it can go places most of its rivals can’t. Priced around"

If you prefer sportier, athletic manners, go for the Mazda CX-5. If you want Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, you’ll also have to look elsewhere.",25490,"Driving the Used 2018 Jeep CherokeeWhile you probably expect the Jeep Cherokee to stand apart from rivals like the Honda CR-V where the pavement ends, you might be pleasantly surprised to know that it’s quite comfortable and quiet on-road, too. It’s not very fun to drive in corners, but it shines on the highway, taking some of the misery from a long commute. The standard 4-cylinder isn’t very peppy, so bring patience for passing and getting up to speed. The optional V6 handles tasks better, but the 9-speed transmission that’s linked to both engines can be hesitant but seems to be improving over earlier versions. If you are one for off-road adventures, or just live where snow and muddy roads are part of life, you’ll appreciate the Selec-Terrain system on 4-wheel-drive models that optimizes the Cherokee for such conditions with the twist of a dial.
Interior ComfortThe Cherokee’s 2-row/5-passenger interior blends traditional Jeep cues — such as the trapezoidal ""center stack"" — with modern touches to create an attractive and upscale layout. The front seats are surprisingly well-padded and comfortable. The heated and ventilated top-of-the-line seats also come with power adjustments and memory. The 2nd-row seats adjust forward and backward for better legroom, and split 60/40 for maximum cargo flexibility. On Latitude Plus and higher models, the front-passenger seat also folds. Still, the Cherokee can’t touch cargo-carrying capacity of the CR-V: 54.9 cubic feet with rear seats folded, vs. 75.8 cubic feet in the Honda.
Exterior Styling""Polarizing"" is one way to describe the Jeep Cherokee, most notably regarding its headlights. It’s one thing to stray from the traditional Jeep design aesthetic of round headlights flanking a 7-slot grille, but quite another to ditch the appearance of headlights entirely, in favor of thin light housings that seem to squint. But there remain other Jeep characteristics, such as the 7-slot grille that folds it into the hood. The less-controversial rear resembles the Grand Cherokee SUV. Trailhawk versions kick up the attitude with a higher ride, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear treatments.
Favorite FeaturesV6 ENGINE The Jeep Cherokee is one of only two non-luxury compact SUVs to offer a V6 (Mitsubishi’s Outlander is the other). Where its rivals have turned to turbocharged 4-cylinders for extra power, the Jeep gets it the old-fashioned way with extra cylinders and more displacement.
 TOWING CAPACITY Here’s another reason to opt for the V6. With this engine, the 2018 Cherokee’s towing capacity increases from 2,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder to 4,500 pounds, an impressive figure for a small SUV. 
Standard FeaturesWith 2018’s trim shuffle, the Jeep Cherokee lineup now starts with the Latitude trim, which includes air conditioning, high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, 17-inch aluminum wheels and rearview camera. The basic Uconnect infotainment system includes a 5-inch display with rearview camera monitor, and 6-speaker audio system with AM/FM radio, USB/auxiliary inputs and Bluetooth connectivity. If you can afford the extra $1,900, you’re better off in the new Latitude Plus trim, which includes the larger 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system with SiriusXM satellite radio, cloth and leather seats, power driver’s seat and 115-volt A/C.
Factory OptionsStepping up to the Cherokee Limited adds a power liftgate, blind-spot monitoring (both optional on Latitude Plus), power-adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, universal garage remote, 18-inch wheels and remote engine start. Cherokee Overland trims have premium leather seating, power-adjustable passenger seat, navigation, Alpine premium audio system and cornering fog lights. Cherokee Trailhawk trims add off-road-oriented features, including the Jeep Active Drive II system with Drive Lock and rock-crawling terrain mode. Options range from safety/driver-assist systems like adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and automatic emergency braking to a dual-pane sunroof and ventilated front seats. Notably absent are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are offered in the 2018 Cherokee. Standard is 2.4-liter Tigershark 4-cylinder that makes 184 horsepower, not a lot as this vehicle can top 4,000 pounds. Better suited is the 271-horsepower, 3.2-liter V6, standard on the 4×4 Overland and optional on all other models. Both engines use a 9-speed automatic transmission, whether equipped with front-wheel drive (FWD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). Three different 4WD systems are available, starting with the base Jeep Active Drive I with a single-speed transfer case. Active Drive II has a 2-speed transfer case, while Active Drive Lock is reserved for the Trailhawk, which also includes the Rock mode in the Selec-Terrain system.

With a dozen other rivals in the compact-SUV segment, it can be difficult to stand out. Yet the Cherokee manages to do so, thanks largely to its inherent ""Jeep-ness."" That is, its rugged image isn’t just for show. All models have an attitude for adventure, and properly outfitted such as in Trailhawk form, the Cherokee is a legitimate off-roader. In everyday commuting, the Cherokee is comfortable and quiet, and boasts a strong roster of tech and amenities. It’s also one of the last small SUVs to offer a V6 engine, which is fortunate because the standard 4-cylinder can feel anemic.

Driving the Used 2018 MAZDA MX-5 MiataIt’s best to get out on the road early, after the sun breaks the horizon, but before the throngs of SUVs create the inevitable clog and clutter. Put the top down. Feel that sun on your face and the warm breeze on nape of your neck. The Mazda MX-5 Miata has never been about gobs of power that enable it to drag-race. This Mazda’s magic lies not in straight lines, but when the road twists and turns. That’s when this rear-wheel-drive 2-seater is at its best, or when simply cruising along a coastal highway. The Mazda’s 155 horsepower doesn’t sound like much, but the 2.0-liter engine loves to rev and its output is more than enough in this lightweight little roadster. Wring its neck and zip through the gears of the Miata’s tight 6-speed manual transmission and it will hit 60 mph in about six seconds. The steering is quick, with plenty of feel, and the roadster’s suspension offers plenty of cornering grip while maintaining a civilized ride.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Mazda MX-5 roadster has a simple, straightforward and modern interior. It’s similar to the Mazda3 sedan and hatchback, with an upright infotainment screen on the dash, a push-button start button, and a surprising amount of soft-touch materials. Mazda says it literally designed the car around the driver, and the MX-5 offers excellent steering-wheel, pedal and shifter placement, though we wish the steering wheel telescoped in addition to tilting. Despite the small size, it’s surprisingly accommodating for tall drivers, offering good headroom. There’s even a usefully sized trunk, but as with the previous-gen model, interior space is at a premium.
Exterior StylingAfter three generations of much of the same, Mazda’s designers had a little bit more fun with the styling of this latest 2018 MX-5 Miata. The profile keeps the classic long-hood/short-deck proportions, but the intricate surfacing of the panels is far more modern, and its flared wheelwells, squinted LED headlights and wide-mouth grille give it some attitude. Not too much. It’s still kinda cute and at only 154 inches long it remains quite small. With its top in place, the MX-5 RF is a sleek coupe, but don’t let those windows in the RF’s B-pillar fool you; they’re fakes. And with the power-operated center panel tucked away, it looks like nothing else new on the road outside of a Porsche 911 Targa.
Favorite FeaturesADAPTIVE FRONT LIGHTING SYSTEMThis available system actually turns the sports car’s headlights as you turn the steering wheel, helping you see better around turns at night. The Miata’s headlights pivot as much as 15 degrees, which doesn’t sound like much, but it makes all the difference when you’re attacking a dark twisty road.
REAR CROSS-TRAFFIC ALERTSmall roadsters like the 2018 Mazda Miata don’t have great rear visibility when the top is up. Backing out of a parking space can be treacherous, so we recommend the Miata’s available cross-traffic alert system, which warns you audibly and visually if a vehicle or pedestrian is approaching from either side.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Mazda Miata lineup is divided into three different models for the standard convertible — Sport, Club and Grand Touring — while the new MX-5 RF retractable fastback is divided into two — Club and Grand Touring. All Miata convertibles come with LED headlights, push-button ignition, air conditioning, power windows and the world’s easiest-to-use folding cloth top. It’s manual, but you can raise or lower it from the driver’s seat. Also standard is a 6-speed manual transmission. The 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system includes Bluetooth and a USB input. Cruise control is also standard, and the little steering wheel is packed with audio and cruise-control buttons. This year the Mazda Connect infotainment system has been made standard on the base Sport model.
Factory OptionsWhile even a base 2018 Mazda Miata is a hoot, we recommend stepping up to the Club trim, which nets extra amenities and safety features, including blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and a Bose premium audio system with HD Radio and a secondary USB audio input. Manual-transmission versions come with a sport-tuned suspension with Bilstein shocks and limited-slip differential. Grand Touring models get leather upholstery, navigation, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated seats, and lane-departure warning. A 6-speed automatic transmission is optional on all versions. Club models can be equipped with higher-performance Brembo brakes, BBS wheels and leather Recaro seats for an additional $3,400.
Engine & TransmissionThe sole engine in the new 2018 Mazda MX-5 is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 155 horsepower. It comes standard with a slick 6-speed manual transmission, and even if you don’t know how to drive stick, it’s worth learning just so you can enjoy this one. The action is light, the shifts are short, and the clutch operation is simply spot-on. If you must, a 6-speed automatic is available; unfortunately, it adds a notable amount of weight, and despite the manual-shift mode, we still think it’s worth getting the manual. Either way, you’ll fill this sports car with premium unleaded, but with up to 35 mpg on the highway, you won’t do it often.

Hank Aaron struck out nearly 1,400 times on his way to hitting 755 career home runs after breaking Babe Ruth’s record with 715 homers in April of 1974. When we remember Hank, it’s not for the 1,400 strike outs, but for the 715 homers to break Ruth’s record. It was truly a historic event, even for people who didn’t follow baseball. To get the feeling of joy Hank must have felt watching number 715 sail over Yankee Stadium’s left-field wall, you only have to take advantage of the low 1.49% APR Ford is offering on its Ford Blue Advantage (FBA) Gold-level 2018 Escape during April. Ford is making this offer through Ford Credit to only well-qualified buyers.
Ford recently updated its certified pre-owned (CPO) program with FBA, and Gold level is the cream of the cream of used Fords. Not only does Ford offer a sensational financing rate on these vehicles, but it provides them with extra warranty coverage. But wait, there’s more. Ford tosses in a few added-value perks like $35 per day rental-car reimbursement and a free 90-day satellite-radio subscription.

Driving the Used 2018 Ford EscapeThe 2018 Escape is among the nimbler, fun-to-drive compact SUVs, splitting the difference between the athletic Mazda CX-5 and the more comfort-oriented Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. A high nose, prominent A-pillars and relatively large turning circle do impact its abilities in super-tight confines but have little effect on busy city streets and freeways. A full roster of available driving aids, from blind-spot monitoring to lane-keeping assist to adaptive cruise control makes the act of driving safer and less fatiguing. The Escape’s trio of powerplants spans from the adequate 2.5-liter 4-cylinder in base models to the 245-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo that makes the Escape capable of very quick escapes. If you go with that most powerful engine, we recommend all-wheel drive, which helps put the power down better. Most buyers will be more than happy with the 1.5-liter turbo that splits the power difference between the base and range-topping engine.
Interior ComfortThe Escape SUV benefited from a wide-ranging remake last year. Virtually every touch surface was revised to create a more premium look and feel, a move that should keep this 2-row/5-passenger compact-crossover SUV fresh in the years ahead. The Escape’s electronic parking brake and repositioned shift lever ease access to the climate controls and center-stack media bin with USB port and 12V power point. Other improvements included a more user-friendly multifunction steering wheel, re-contoured front buckets, a larger center armrest and bigger covered console bin. Dropping the 60/40 fold-flat rear seat doubles the usable storage area from 34.0 to 68.0 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingAlso updated just last year, the Escape’s exterior remains fresh thanks to a recast nose that portrays an edgier character defined by a soft cap, prominent hexagonal grille – which conceals active grille shutters to improve efficiency — sleeker LED-infused headlights and larger outboard air intakes along with a redrawn aluminum hood. A Sport Appearance Package, available on SE models, aims to bring an edgier vibe with blackout-trim accents, halogen headlights and 19-inch Ebony Black alloy wheels. For 2018, the Escape gains new colors: Blue Metallic and Cinnamon Glaze.
Favorite FeaturesSYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
Ford keeps improving its Sync touch-screen infotainment system, making it easier to see, easier to use and more responsive. The latest version, Sync 3 — standard on SEL and Titanium models and optional on the SE — has an 8-inch screen and is CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.
TOWING CAPACITY
The Ford Escape handily beats the towing-capacity rivals, including the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. While those are limited to 1,500 pounds — what a base Escape pulls — models with the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter turbo engines offer Class II tow packages rated to tow 2,000 and 3,500 pounds, respectively.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Escape is available in four trims: S, SE, SEL and Titanium. The least expensive Ford Escape is a pretty basic small SUV with cruise control, rearview camera, 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat and automatic headlights. The basic infotainment system includes 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio with USB input, 4.2-inch screen and Ford’s basic Sync system with Bluetooth connectivity and voice recognition. You’re better off with at least an SE model, which adds a turbo engine, dual-zone climate control, privacy glass, 10-way-power driver’s seat and heated front seats. It also opens the door for all-wheel drive and options like Sync 3 with CarPlay and more.
Factory OptionsThe new SEL nicely slots between the SE and Titanium with standard power tailgate, leather interior, Sync 3 and its 8-inch touch screen and even the Sync Connect system with built-in Wi-Fi and the ability to lock, unlock and start the car from a phone. Top-line Titanium models add the most powerful engine in the lineup, hands-free tailgate, push-button start, heated steering wheel, power passenger seat, navigation and 10-speaker Sony premium audio with HD Radio. Optional starting on SE trims are blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control with forward-collision warning, lane-keep assist and a parking system that aids with parallel and reverse parking.
Engine & TransmissionThree engines remain available in the Escape, though this year each is tied to specific trims. All are 4-cylinder powerplants connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Base Ford Escape S models use a 2.5-liter, in front-wheel drive (FWD) only. Ford Escape SE and the new SEL use a 1.5-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine with FWD standard and all-wheel drive (AWD) optional. Though smaller than the 2.5-liter, it has greater horsepower (179 vs. 168) thanks to the forced induction of turbocharging. Now exclusive to the Titanium model is the 2.0-liter, which packs 245 horsepower and can tow 3,500 pounds. It too is FWD or AWD, and we recommend the latter to prevent torque steer. Both EcoBoost engines use a start/stop system that shuts off the engine at idle.

SE models get heated front seats, while the Titanium now comes exclusively with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine.
The 2018 Ford Escape is a competent, popular player in the crowded compact-SUV class. In addition to facing similarly well-known rivals like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, the Escape competes with fresher nameplates such as the Mazda CX-5. The Escape keeps pace on both tech and safety fronts with seamless smartphone integration and a suite of driver-assistance features. Ford’s compact-crossover SUV also benefits from a trio of engine choices, including one that packs 245 horsepower. A new trim for 2018, the SEL, fills the white space and price gap between the mid-tier SE and range-topping Titanium. With athletic driving manners and a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds, the Escape remains a well-rounded choice in the ever-competitive compact-crossover-SUV arena.

A used 2018 Honda Accord is a smart choice for many reasons. At 3-years old, a 2018 Accord will have enough depreciation to make the price genuinely tempting. Except for the Touring trim’s optional turbocharged engine, the 2018 and 2021 cars are not all that different.
The three-year mark is also the time when many leased Accords will be returning to the dealer lot, giving buyers a more comprehensive range of low-mileage Accords in excellent condition. Choose one of these, and it will likely be a Certified Pre-Owned Accord, which brings us to the last reason 2018 is a good year for a used Accord.
If you buy from a private party, the odds are good most of the limited warranty will have expired, with only a short time left on the powertrain warranty.

Driving the Used 2018 Honda Accord HybridThe 2018 Honda Accord expresses itself differently depending upon trim level. The standard 192-horsepower 1.5-liter engine offers strong off-the-line performance and acceptable levels of power for passing and merging, but the biggest advantage is its class-leading 33-mpg combined fuel-economy figure. Moving up to the 2.0-liter turbo brings a more robust response, with 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque available as low as 2,200 rpm. We spent a good deal of time in the Touring trim outfitted with the 2.0-liter and the Adaptive Damper System. This engine is mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which we generally liked, but did notice a bit of hesitation in some passing maneuvers, followed by a slight shudder. The adaptive dampers did a good a job helping the Accord round corners with confidence, but also rendered the big Honda more susceptible to road distortion and freeway expansion joints. The Touring’s 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires didn’t help matters much, either.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Honda Accord touts an all-new interior that is both roomier and more sophisticated than the 2017 model. Front and center is an available 8-inch infotainment screen with large, colorful tiles, and pinch, swipe and zoom functions. The cavernous rear seat offers plenty of legroom and can be equipped with seat heaters, but sadly no USB or additional power ports. Up front, there’s more room in all directions and the controls are logically arranged and easy to operate. One oddity is the push-button gear selector located right next to the cup holders. We’ve all experienced drink spillage while in motion, making us question the wisdom of placing a flat panel push-button controller so close to potential liquid disaster.
Exterior StylingThe new Accord is slightly shorter but lower and wider than the previous car. The low hood improves aerodynamics, aided by an underbody aerodynamic kit and, on 1.5 EX trims, active grille shutters. The 2018 Accord’s wheelbase is also longer and the track wider. The result is a very seductive looking Accord that only gets better looking as you move up the trims. The Sport wears 19-inch black-and-chrome alloy wheels, LED fog lights and a rear spoiler, while Touring trims get full-LED headlights, adaptive dampers, and front and rear parking sensors. Thanks to some clever repackaging, the Accord Hybrid now offers the same 16.7 cubic feet of trunk space and folding rear seats as found in the Accord sedan.
Favorite FeaturesHONDA SENSING
Standard on every Accord, the Honda Sensing suite offers more standard safety features than any sedan in this class. The package includes adaptive cruise control, auto high beams, collision-mitigation braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, traffic-sign recognition, and low-speed follow.
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION
We know manual transmissions are not long for this world, but if your trim name is Sport, then a good manual transmission definitely belongs in the mix. Available with both the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter turbo engines, the Accord Sport’s 6-speed manual transmission is rarity on a sedan of this size, but it definitely improves the fun factor.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Accord comes in five trims: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. The most basic Accord LX features the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), Honda Sensing (see Favorite Features), push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights, multi-view rear backup camera, 7-inch display audio with Bluetooth connectivity and auto on/off headlights. Moving up to the Sport trim brings the option of the 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission as well as standard 8-inch display audio, Sport combi seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 12-way power driver’s seat, 60/40 split rear seat, and more.
Factory OptionsIn typical Honda fashion, options are allotted by trim. Moving up to the EX trim brings blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, a power moonroof, remote start, heated front seats and rear-seat air vents. The EX-L includes leather seats, a 450-watt audio system, and a 4-way power passenger seat. The Touring trim adds navigation (optional on the EX-L), full-LED headlights, head-up display, wireless phone charging, HondaLink Assist, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors. Hybrid models pretty much match their non-hybrid counterparts, although there is no Sport trim.
Engine & TransmissionHonda’s Accord sedan for 2018 offers a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. Standard is the 1.5-liter turbo good for 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, a 7-horsepower improvement over last year’s 2.4-liter engine. Optional on the Sport, EX and Touring is a 2.0-liter turbo pumping out 252 horsepower, a noticeable loss of 26 horsepower over the previous 3.5-liter V6. However, the 2.0-liter brings an additional 21 lb-ft of torque to the table, all of which is available at a much lower rpm. All trims with the 1.5-liter engine are mated to a CVT automatic transmission, with the exception of the Sport which offers a 6-speed manual option. The 2.0-liter is paired with Honda’s new 10-speed automatic, again the only exception being the Sport 2.0’s 6-speed manual gearbox. The 2018 Accord Hybrid employs the previous generation’s 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric-motor setup, as well as the CVT transmission.

1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 (LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, Touring)

192 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-5,000 rpm

The Accord Touring features a new adaptive suspension, while other trims offer the latest in infotainment and smartphone integration. The Accord Hybrid expands from three trims to five and has a lower starting price than the previous version.
One of the best-selling sedans in America just got a major overhaul and wow, does it look good. The 2018 Honda Accord banishes the cautious styling of previous generations in favor of a racy coupe-like silhouette, which is good because Honda just killed off the Accord Coupe. A new set of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines replace the previous 4- and 6-cylinder engines, allowing Honda engineers to give the Accord a lower, wider stance. The new Accord’s longer wheelbase improves rear-seat space, so much so that a rear-facing child seat can now fit securely without hitting the front seatback. Honda Sensing brings more standard driver-assist features than are offered with the Toyota Camry, giving the Ohio-built Accord a slight advantage over its longtime nemesis.

Driving the Used 2018 Ford EdgeWith an impressive balance of ride comfort, fuel efficiency and ample power, the 2018 Ford Edge is one well-rounded SUV. The base 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine is unique in both its potency and fuel economy, churning out 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, nearly equal to some competitors’ optional 6-cylinder engines. Although a naturally aspirated V6 is available, we really don’t see the need. Those looking for truly top-end performance should opt for the 315-horsepower twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 exclusive to the Edge Sport. The Sport includes a sport-tuned suspension for improved handling, but also comes with a noticeably stiffer ride. Fuel-economy fans will note that the front-drive Edge with the 2.0-liter engine comes with start/stop technology, a feature as annoying to some as it is welcome by others.
Interior ComfortFord’s Edge crossover SUV for 2018 offers a 2-row, 5-passenger layout that has generous space for both people and cargo. The Edge’s large exterior and form-fitting seats yield impressive legroom for both front and rear passengers, with the rear seats offering a commendable 40.6 inches. Cargo capacity is 39.2 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 73.4 with them folded. The cabin has a fresh, premium design. Ford has moved away from adaptive-touch controls, equipping the Edge with hard buttons for audio and climate controls. As mentioned, the revamped Sync 3 is a vast improvement over the past MyFord Touch.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Ford Edge crossover SUV has a wide, squat profile. That translates to a roomy interior, but beware this Ford’s wide dimensions when pulling into a one-car garage. Ford Edge styling is conservative yet strong, starting with a large trapezoidal grille and ending with a sloped rear and wraparound lights that bring cohesion. Sport models stand apart with their piano-black grille treatment, unique headlights, body-color front and rear fascias, and body-color lower cladding. They can also be spotted from behind by their pair of trapezoidal exhaust housings instead of the circular bright tips of those on the other trims.
Favorite Features2.7-LITER ECOBOOST V6 ENGINE Available only in the 2018 Ford Edge Sport, the 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 turns the Edge into a performance hottie, with a stiffened suspension to better hug corners and standard all-wheel drive for improved grip and reduced torque steer.
 SYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM After years of nightmarish complaints about its Sync infotainment system, Ford has finally gotten it right with Sync 3. Faster and more intuitive, the system in Ford’s 2018 Edge now includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Sync 3 is standard on Sport and Titanium trims and optional on the SEL.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Ford Edge comes in four trims: SE, SEL, Titanium and Sport. Spend the least on a base SE and you’ll still get a high-tech turbocharged engine, keyless entry and push-button start, rearview camera, cloth seats with 6-way-manual driver’s adjustment, and 18-inch wheels. Infotainment is brought to you by a basic Sync system with 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity. If your budget can budge another $3,000, you’re better off with an SEL model that adds power driver and passenger seats, reverse-parking aid, dual-zone climate control, EasyFold remote rear-seat release and satellite radio.
Factory OptionsOptions abound, running the gamut from pragmatic to the entertaining. Of the former, all-wheel drive can be had for better traction. Other features include navigation, a forward-facing camera to aid in parking, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision and lane-keeping warning systems, and inflatable rear safety belts. A parking-assist system is also available. The high-end, leather-clad Titanium and Sport models offer Ford’s adaptive steering system, which varies response based on speed, and the hands-free liftgate feature that you’ll appreciate every time your hands are lugging groceries. Other amenities include heated/ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, panoramic roof and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionYou have a choice of three engines in the 2018 Ford Edge. Standard on SE, SEL and Titanium models is a 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder. In addition to powering the standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) models, the small but potent powerplant is offered with all-wheel drive (AWD). Optional on SEL and Titanium models is a 3.5-liter V6. Top-line Sport models come with the most powerful engine, a 315-horsepower 2.7-liter EcoBoost turbocharged V6 with standard AWD. All models continue to use Ford’s well-integrated 6-speed automatic transmission. All also have a Sport mode for quicker acceleration, and paddle shifters replace the former awkward manual-shift buttons. With the max-towing package, all models of the Edge except the Sport are rated to pull 3,500 pounds, with the Sport rated for 2,000 pounds.

A new SEL Sport Package is offered this year with blacked-out headlight bezels and Magnetic Metallic paint covering the grille, mirror caps, 10-spoke 19-inch wheels and rear spoiler. Inside, unique cloth seats with suede inserts augment Copper Sands appliques.
As more midsize-crossover SUVs morph into larger 7-passenger SUVs, it’s nice to know the 2018 Ford Edge remains a roomy, 5-passenger offering brimming with style, power and features. Ford’s 2018 Edge crossover SUV delivers car-like ride and handling plus the ability to tackle deep snow and light off-road trails. Although softer than a Jeep Grand Cherokee or Subaru Outback, the Edge nevertheless offers a number of sporty trims that can run circles around the Outback. Towing is another area where the Edge has a leg up on the Subaru. The Edge’s premium look and feel don’t come cheap, however, and you can save thousands buying an entry-level (but less well-equipped) SUV from Subaru, Kia or Nissan.

If you’re looking for a small, affordable and fuel-efficient hatchback, check out the 2018 Nissan Versa Note, which is reviewed separately. Some may find the Versa sedan’s very low starting price attractive, but know that the base model comes with a manual transmission, manual crank windows and manual door locks.",13000,"Used 2018 Nissan Versa PricingThe 2018 Nissan Versa S has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $12,875 including the $885 destination charge, making it the least expensive new car available in the U.S. But the price climbs quickly; move up to the Versa S Plus to get the Xtronic automatic transmission and the price jumps to about $15,000. However, even if you get the top-line Versa SV, you’ll still pay less than $17,000, which is pretty good for a fully loaded new car. By comparison, the Kia Rio has a more powerful engine and a longer warranty, and starts around $15,000; same with the Chevy Sonic, Hyundai Accent, Toyota Yaris and Ford Fiesta. Whatever you decide, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their Versa. Strong resale value is another characteristic of the Versa, where it’s a best-in-class leader.
Driving the Used 2018 Nissan VersaLooking at its base price, it’s easy to expect the 2018 Nissan Versa to be as rough-riding as a stage coach and just as noisy. Slow too, and with a driver’s seat that feels like a milk crate. Wrong. Our Versa SV test vehicle was a pleasant surprise from behind its leather-wrapped steering wheel. It’s comfortable, quiet for its class, and it feels substantial going down the road. No, it’s not going to pamper you like a new Mercedes or thrill you like a supercar, but the Versa is agile and its little 4-cylinder engine has just enough power to move the little sedan with zip. There’s good steering feel, plus a tight turn radius that makes parking this small sedan a snap, excellent visibility, comfortable and supportive seats, and good head- and legroom. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is extremely smooth and increases fuel economy compared to the 5-speed manual.
Interior ComfortThe interior of the 2018 Nissan Versa is comfortable, ergonomically sensible and nicely assembled. It’s also one of the most spacious in its class. Rear passengers get 37 inches of legroom, three inches more than in the Chevy Sonic. Headroom is also generous. Even the trunk is big with its 14.9 cubic feet, which expands when you fold the rear seatbacks on the SV trim. The design isn’t fancy, and the controls and materials are all basic. The three knobs that control the air conditioning and heat are well-sized, and the infotainment system is easy to use. The tilt steering wheel and height-adjustable seat made getting comfortable easy.
Exterior StylingFrom some angles it’s easy to confuse the 2018 Nissan Versa with the larger and more expensive Nissan Sentra and Altima sedans. The Versa, with its long 102.4-inch wheelbase and 175.4-inch overall length, is big for the subcompact class, and it looks aspirational with its chrome grille surround, our test car’s chrome door handles and its body-color outside mirrors. The Versa’s tall doors make entry and exit easier, and the long rear doors simplify installing a child safety seat. You get nicer-looking alloy wheels and fog lights with the optional SV Special Edition Package, which is available only on the top SV trim level.
Favorite FeaturesGENEROUS REAR-SEAT LEGROOMWith its expansive 102.4-inch wheelbase, which is long for the subcompact class, the 2018 Nissan Versa offers an impressive amount of rear-seat legroom. It measures 37 inches, which is more than you get in most of its competitors including the Chevy Sonic, Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio.
HIGH FUEL ECONOMYThe 2018 Nissan Versa may not be as powerful or fun-to-drive as some of its rivals, but its fuel economy is impressive. Models with the Xtronic CVT are rated 31 mpg in the city and 39 mpg out on the highway. Those numbers make it more fuel efficient than the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Chevy Sonic.
Standard FeaturesThe basic 2018 Nissan Versa is pretty basic, but it does come with air conditioning, power mirrors, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/aux audio system, tilt steering wheel, trip computer, Bluetooth for your phone, front disc/rear drum brakes, 15-inch steel wheels with covers, vanity mirrors and a rear defroster. It also comes with a 5-speed manual transmission and hand-cranked manual windows. If you want such features as power windows, power door locks, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver’s seat, or even a remote trunk release, you’ll have to step up to a higher trim level, such as the S Plus or SV trims.
Factory OptionsClimbing the model ladder is the best way to get more stuff on the 2018 Versa. The mid-level S Plus gets a rear spoiler, cruise control, power windows, and the CVT automatic. Top-of-the-line SV models gain upgraded seat fabric, a 60/40 split-folding rear seat, 6-way manual driver’s seat, power door locks, and keyless entry with push-button start. All Versa models above basic S get the CVT automatic transmission. The SV Special Edition is the only option package this year, and for just $500 it adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, fog lights, front fascia chrome, and a Piano Black console lid. Also available is a set of black alloy wheels for $495.
Engine & TransmissionThe only engine available in the front-wheel-drive 2018 Nissan Versa sedan is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 109 horsepower. That’s not a lot of power, but the Versa’s not a lot of car, either. Besides, with the CVT automatic transmission it gets an impressive 39 mpg on the highway according to the EPA. If you get the basic Versa S you get a standard 5-speed manual transmission but we suggest skipping it and moving up to the S Plus model with the automatic if you can.

Nissan has added standard adjustable front headrests, map lights and variable intermittent windshield wipers to all trim levels. There’s also a new exterior color, Deep Blue Pearl.

What’s for sale near me?I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.
Driving the Used 2018 Hyundai SonataAlready lauded for its comfort, Hyundai updated the Sonata’s suspension to improve handling and reduce body roll. While the ride is firmer, comfort wasn’t sacrificed in the process. The standard 2.4-liter has enough power to satisfy most drivers, with ample acceleration and passing power, and decent fuel economy. This transmission works harder on grades, but it shifts smoothly and does a fine job managing the power. If you want more sporting attitude, consider the optional 2.0-liter turbo engine. It offers 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque — the same as last year — but is now backed by a new 8-speed automatic transmission. It offers quick acceleration from a stop and plenty of easy-to-access torque. The 8-speed is responsive, yet the shifts are smooth and subtle. With the 2.0-liter engine, the Sonata receives a different version of electric power steering, which has a natural feel.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Sonata’s redesigned interior looks sharper, and as an added benefit: The controls are even more intuitive. The screen sits higher, allowing all the controls to sit higher, making them easier to reach. Buttons and knobs are well organized in wider horizontal rows, with navigation and audio controls just below the screen and the climate controls falling neatly below. The new 3-spoke steering wheel has a more upscale design, and the overall look and feel of the interior is more premium than before. Sport models have a flat-bottomed steering wheel and cloth seats with leather bolsters and contrast stitching.
Exterior StylingNo longer lost in the shuffle, the Sonata’s new sense of style is dominated in front by Hyundai’s cascading grille, sharper lines and LED running lights. Sport models receive a unique grille and front fascia, plus dual exhaust tips. In all models, the panoramic sunroof option is gone, replaced by an available conventional tilt-and-slide unit. Also, the trunk release is now hidden in the Hyundai logo. Push the area below the ring, above the ""H"" to open the trunk. Once the lid opens, you have access to the largest trunk in the Sonata’s class.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED CABINBetween standard features like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 7-inch touch screen and Bluetooth, and options such as wireless smartphone charging, navigation, satellite radio, Blue Link telecommunications, and a rear USB port, your crew will always be charged, connected and caught up on social media.
DRIVE MODESAll Sonatas come standard with drive modes: Eco, Comfort and Sport. Eco improves fuel economy by changing the transmission and throttle programming. Sport mode affects transmission, throttle and steering response. The 2.0T adds a Smart driving mode. This alternates between the other three modes, responding to the driver’s input.
Standard FeaturesHyundai reorganized its trim-level lineup: It dropped the base model, making the SE the most affordable Sonata. It comes nicely equipped with plenty of tech, including a 7-inch touch screen display, 6-speaker audio system, Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, a rearview camera, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Sonata also has air conditioning, power windows and locks, heated side mirrors, blind-spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist, cloth seats, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a 60/40-split fold-down rear seatback. There are seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag, plus standard stability control and electronic brake assist.
Factory OptionsFrom SE, you can move up to SEL, Sport and Limited. Available features include automatic high beams, 10-speaker Infinity audio, navigation, power heated/ventilated leather front seats, a heated steering wheel, and Blue Link Connected Car. Those in the back seat can enjoy a USB port, center-console-mounted vents and rear side window shades. LED headlights and taillights, 17- or 18-inch wheels and a hands-free smart trunk are available, while safety adds include smart cruise control, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors, and lane-keep assist. You can also get the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with an 8-speed automatic.
Engine & TransmissionThere are five drivetrain choices for the 2018 Hyundai Sonata, all of them with four cylinders. The standard 185-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4 is more than adequate. For a more spirited drive, you can choose the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and its 245 horsepower, an engine that is now backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. The Sonata Eco’s 1.6-liter turbo puts out less horsepower (178) but more torque (195 lb-ft) than the standard 2.4, and is available only with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. The two hybrid models — regular and plug-in each pairs a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with a battery-powered electric motor. The plug-in model has a larger battery pack that allows up to 27 miles of electric-only range. Both are unique among hybrid sedans in that they use a 6-speed automatic transmission vs. the continuously variable transmission (CVT) setups found in rivals.

Read Full Review","What's New?New styling, new technology, a redesigned interior and a new transmission behind the available turbocharged engine are the biggest highlights for the 2018 Hyundai Sonata. Hyundai has added more features while only marginal price increases, keeping the Sonata among the least expensive midsize sedans you can get.
As SUV sales dominate, the midsize sedan market has become more competitive than ever. Fighting for every scrap of midsize sedan sales, mainstays like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry continue to top the sales charts, but rivals like the Hyundai Sonata are ambitious climbers. The Sonata also faces strong contenders like the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, Nissan Altima, and Kia Optima. The Sonata already stood out for tremendous value for the money, a choice of naturally aspirated, turbocharged, hybrid and plug-in drivetrains; the latest in high-tech, and a comfortable and quiet driving environment. Refreshed this year, the 2018 Hyundai Sonata receives a significant update that adds more muscular styling, a redesigned interior, and a new transmission for the turbocharged engine.

The 707-horsepower SRT Hellcat is right around $66,000, and has to be an all-time performance bargain. A “similarly equipped” competitor, such as a Chevrolet Impala, is around $28,000 but, when considering the performance levels of Hemi Chargers, “similarly equipped” competitors tend to be things like an $80,000 BMW M5. Historically, resale values on Dodges have been below average. Before making your purchase, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for a 2018 Charger.
Driving the Used 2018 Dodge ChargerThe Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 delivers 292 horsepower in the base 2018 Charger SXT sedan, and 300 horsepower in the new GT trim with standard all-wheel drive. The automaker’s notorious 8-speed automatic seems to work well here, delivering smooth gear changes without the annoying gear hunting we’ve experienced in other vehicles. Good as they are, the V6 cars are far less appealing than the Hemi-powered models. A 5.7-liter V8 in the R/T and Daytona delivers a tire-spinning 370 horsepower, while the R/T Scat Pack, Daytona 392 and SRT 392 trims get a 485-horsepower 6.4-liter Hemi V8. For our money, the R/T Scat Pack is the best combination of power, price and drivability. Of course, if you can lay hands on one, the 707-horsepower Charger SRT Hellcat is the one to buy, drive sparingly and then put into storage for the next 40 years. In general, the entire Charger line is smooth and responsive.
Interior ComfortInviting, comfortable and functional, the interior of the 2018 the Dodge Charger is a pleasant place to spend time. Cockpit-style, the instrument panel angles all the working stuff toward the driver, the gauge cluster is configurable for individual preferences, and there are numerous controls mounted on the steering wheel. In the center is an available 8.4-inch touch screen, and it and the Uconnect infotainment system are a couple of features we recommend. Front seats are comfortable for long trips, the rear bench will handle three adults and the entire well-designed presentation is also easy on the eyes.
Exterior StylingThis is no wallflower. No shrinking violet. No wolf in sheep’s clothing. No cliché. The Dodge Charger for 2018 looks like what it is: a modern American sedan with plenty of horsepower. It looks tough. It looks mean. It looks you right in the eye. Despite a roofline and overall shape unmistakably linked to previous Chargers built from 1968-1970, this sedan successfully fights being old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern front to rear. Its smoothly rounded nose makes obvious aerodynamic contributions, and the attractive rear includes Dodge’s distinctive layout of the “racetrack” taillight arrangement, which certainly stands out in after-dark traffic.
Favorite FeaturesBEATS AUDIOThe Charger’s Uconnect system is widely regarded as one of the best infotainment systems in the industry, but it gets even better when connected to the 10-speaker, 552-watt Beats Audio setup. Need more sound? There’s a 19-speaker GreenEdge harman/kardon system on upper level trims.
6.2-LITER HELLCAT SUPERCHARGED V8Befitting its title as the most powerful American sedan ever built, the Charger SRT Hellcat is equipped with a 707-horsepower, 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8 that simply puts all other V8 engines to shame, regardless of price and pedigree.
Standard FeaturesLED daytime running lights, acoustic front glass and windshield, power windows with express front up/down, rearview camera, rear parking sensors, 7-inch touch screen with Uconnect 4, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are all standard features on the base 2018 Dodge Charger SXT. Also standard are chrome exhaust tips, auto headlights that turn themselves on and off, power mirrors, 17-inch wheels and tires and an electronic reconfigurable gauge cluster. The standard powertrain is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with a strong 292 horsepower backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsTrim levels are tied closely to engine choices, with corresponding moves upward not only in performance but also in features and luxury. Depending on the trim level and options chosen you can have a Charger with a base price well under $30 grand or well over $60,000, and with horsepower just under 300 or more than twice that. Major options include a power sunroof, Beats by Dr. Dre and harman/kardon sound systems, and several packages: Super Track Pak, Technology Group, Driver Confidence Group, Navigation and others. Forward emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring are available in the Premium Group.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Charger sedan is available with four engine choices. Standard in the SXT and GT models is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with 292 horsepower (300 in the SXT Plus w/Super Track Pack, GT and GT Plus) and plenty of performance for just about anybody. Next up is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 of 370 horsepower, in R/T and Daytona versions. It’s one more step to a 6.4-liter Hemi of 485 horsepower, in R/T Scat Pack and Daytona 392 and SRT 392 trims. And, if a 485-horsepower Hemi isn’t quite enough, there’s the 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi in the SRT Hellcat, with 707 horsepower. In all cases, the transmission is an 8-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive (RWD). All-wheel drive (AWD) is standard on the GT trim.

Driving the Used 2018 Toyota Tacoma Access CabIn most driving environments and situations, the Tacoma’s 159-horsepower 2.7-liter engine is powerful enough, but climbing grades with a full load in the bed will require some planning and probably full throttle. Plus, the 4-cylinder can get a little rowdy when you rev it out. This is also easily fixed by choosing the 3.5-liter V6. This engine makes 278 horsepower and significantly improves the capability of the 2018 Tacoma, and it makes the Toyota a more enjoyable pickup to drive. The 6-speed automatic transmission isn’t exactly state of the art, but it works well with both engines. The V6 and 6-speed manual combination is rewarding to drive. Seating is comfortable and overall visibility is excellent; however, the Tacoma’s pedal and steering-wheel placement may be an issue for shoppers with long legs. The Tacoma also rides well, with less chop than you might expect from a small pickup.
Interior ComfortAs is Toyota’s tradition, assembly quality is excellent. The 2018 Tacoma interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting. It gets push-button start, and the handy multi-information display between the main gauges displays fuel economy, outside temperature and even off-road info such as trail mode or angle of the Tacoma on a steep hill. The new Tacoma also comes with a new version of Entune, the connectivity and entertainment-control center, and Qi wireless charging. However, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available on any model. Neither are power seats.
Exterior StylingNow in its third generation, the Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015 and it still looks fresh. Designed and built in the United States, the 2018 Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old school. There are modern cues, such as LED daytime running lights, and the separate models — SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Pro and Limited — each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.
Favorite FeaturesPRE-COLLISION SYSTEM
This clever system, which is also found on Toyota’s sedans as well as Lexus cars and SUVs, scans the road ahead for obstacles including other vehicles and pedestrians. When a possible collision is detected it will warn you, but if you do not take action to avoid the accident, the system will apply the truck’s brakes for you.
TRD Pro
The TRD Pro is the ultimate off-road-capable Tacoma. It’s also the most expensive at about $43,000, but its unique list of specialized hardware is worth it. These trucks get Fox shocks, additional ground clearance and thick aluminum skidplates, as well as special tires and other equipment and trim. The Tacoma TRD Pro and the Chevy Colorado ZR2 are the elite off-road machines in this class.
Standard FeaturesFor 2018 the Tacoma offers Toyota Safety Sense electronic driver aids as standard equipment. It includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. A rearview camera, a basic version of Entune connectivity, an automatic limited-slip differential, eight airbags, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a lockable tailgate, 16-inch wheels and adjustable tie-down cleats in the bed are also standard. The standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the rear wheels. Interestingly, the Tacoma uses old-school drum brakes in the rear, and power seats are not available, even in high-end models. On the other hand, the standard GoPro camera mount is as 21st-  century as it gets.
Factory OptionsOptions for the new 2018 Toyota Tacoma roughly divide into features that make it more rugged and tough, and those that bump up technology and refinement. There’s the TRD Pro trim level, of course, but beyond that on the tough-truck side of the list are Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control, and a hard tonneau cover. On the technology side the Tacoma offers rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Making life more comfortable is push-button start with Smart Key, Qi wireless charging, tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated leather seats, Entune with a full App suite, and a JBL sound system.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2018 Toyota Tacoma is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that’s been part of the Tacoma lineup pretty much forever. It powers the rear wheels (2WD) or all four wheels (4WD) through a 6-speed automatic. But we suggest skipping it for the 3.5-liter V6. The bigger engine offers nearly 120 more horsepower (278 vs. 159) but gets nearly the same fuel economy and doesn’t cost much more. It’s also available with a 6-speed automatic, and 4WD models can opt for a 6-speed manual, too.

It includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. Most trim levels also get a new and distinct grille treatment. The 5-speed manual transmission is no longer available.
America’s best-selling midsize pickup for more than a decade, the comfortable and capable 2018 Toyota Tacoma has been improved with new standard safety technology, including a Pre-Collision system and Lane Departure Alert. Available in six trim levels and over 30 configurations, the new Toyota Tacoma enjoys a stellar reputation for excellent durability and reliability as well as on- and off-road performance. Two engines are available starting with a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that makes 159 horsepower. We recommend the 278-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, which can be paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual. And when equipped with an optional V6 Tow Package, the Tacoma can tow up to 6,800 pounds. Competitors include the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, as well as the Nissan Frontier.

Those seeking best-in-class towing, payload and horsepower should also look to the domestics. The same goes for features like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",32500,"Driving the Used 2018 Toyota Tundra Access CabToyota’s 2018 Tundra pickup knows how to be tough when it counts and comfortable when it’s needed most. A standard V8 is unique in this field, but for those seeking more power than the 4.6-liter engine can muster, there’s a larger 5.7-liter V8 putting out 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. That’s more than enough grunt to tow up to 10,200 pounds, although the Chevy Silverado’s 12,500-pound rating does leave the Tundra at the back of the trailer-hauling pack. The 2018 Tundra’s fuel economy also lags behind the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 equipped with the diesel-engine option. On the road, the Tundra surprised us with its quiet cabin and pleasant road manners. Off-road, the TRD Sport 4X4 showed it has what it takes to tackle rugged terrain, steep hills and fast-moving creeks, despite the absence of a proper locking rear differential.
Interior ComfortAs with most full-size pickups, the 2018 Toyota Tundra’s interior spans from that of a basic truck with a 3-passenger fabric bench seat to a luxurious family hauler with brown leather interior and wood trim. Double Cab and CrewMax Cab variants seat up to six with a bench in front, or five with the more comfortable bucket seats. Even base SR trims have a 6.1-inch touch-screen infotainment system in the dash, a far cry from the dial radio in your dad’s pickup. Knobs and controls are easier to reach than in past Tundras, and sturdy enough to be used with gloves on.
Exterior StylingThe Toyota Tundra half-ton pickup for 2018 is available in two cab configurations and two bed lengths. Double Cab models can be had with a standard bed (78.7 inches) or long bed (97.6 inches). The CrewMax has the biggest cab of the bunch and is available only with a short bed (66.7 inches). The SR5 and 1794 models have unique front-end styling. As with other full-size trucks, the Toyota’s grille appears to just get bigger and bigger. At the other end, the lockable tailgate automatically lowers slowly to prevent the dreaded tailgate slam.
Favorite FeaturesREPLACEABLE BUMPER PANELS Pickup trucks may be the least pampered vehicles on the road, which is why it’s nice that Toyota offers a 3-piece bumper design making it easy to replace a panel should it get scraped, dented or worse.
 TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE-P Standard on every 2018 Toyota Tundra pickup, the TSS-P system includes the pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, auto high beams, radar-guided cruise control and lane-departure alert. 
Standard FeaturesEven if you buy the least expensive version of Toyota’s 2018 Tundra pickup truck, you’ll get a nicely equipped vehicle with a V8 engine, rearview camera, power windows and door locks, and 6.1-inch touch-screen audio/entertainment system with AM/FM/CD player, USB and auxiliary inputs and Bluetooth wireless phone connectivity. These models also come with a fabric-trimmed 40/20/40-split fold-down front bench seat with 4-way-adjustable driver and passenger seats (tough vinyl is available with the Work Truck package). All Tundra pickups include the TSS-P system as standard equipment.
Factory OptionsMost extras for the 2018 Tundra are bundled into trims. SR5 models add a larger, 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, sliding rear window and the storage compartment under the rear seats, while Limited trims bring premium audio and navigation, power-operated leather-trimmed and heated front bucket seats, 20-inch wheels, chrome mirrors and door handles, and power-operated sliding rear window. The top-line Platinum and 1794 Edition offer heated and cooled front seats, moonroof, JBL premium audio and blind-spot monitoring. The TRD Off-Road package, in Double Cab or CrewMax form, includes all-terrain tires, Bilstein shocks, TRD-tuned springs, a front skidplate, and unique badging.
Engine & TransmissionToyota’s 2018 Tundra is powered solely by a set of V8 engines. A 4.6-liter V8 is the standard engine in lower-trim models, while the powerful-yet-thirsty 5.7-liter is available across all Tundra models and is standard on higher trims of Toyota’s full-size truck. Both V8s are connected to a 6-speed automatic. All Tundra engines run on regular gasoline, the big 5.7-liter V8 is E85-capable, and the truck can be had in 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive (2WD, 4WD). The Tundra’s maximum towing rating is 10,200 pounds and applies to a 2WD Double Cab model with the 5.7-liter V8. Additionally, models with that engine can be had with an integrated trailer-brake controller.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2018 Toyota Tundra sees the Regular Cab and TRD Pro models dropped this year, but a new TRD Sport trim is added. Toyota’s Safety Sense-P is standard on all grades. The system includes pre-collision with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert, adaptive cruise control, and auto high beams.
Still a serious contender in the full-size-pickup market, the 2018 Toyota Tundra is beginning to lose some of its luster. It now struggles against newer pickups like the Ford F-150, Nissan Titan and Chevrolet Silverado, all of which offer more power and features. That said, the Tundra still enjoys a sterling reputation for reliability and resale, and while it may not be able to claim best-in-class in any category of merit, it still has the muscle to tackle the jobs most half-ton pickup buyers demand. Having no diesel-engine option or HD versions, the Tundra gets by with offering a wide range of models and powertrains, although with the loss of the Regular Cab this year, those options have been somewhat slimmed down.

Anchoring the top is the powerful Durango SRT, with a price of just under $65,000. In between are the GT, Citadel, and R/T models, varying between about $39,000 to about $47,400 to start. Options add up, but you can still get a reasonably priced V8-powered Durango for the low $50,000 range, which isn’t bad. Skip the V8 premium and a V6 Durango is price competitive with the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer. Check out the Fair Purchase Price on KBB.com to learn what buyers in your area are actually paying. The Durango will likely hold its value about as well as a Chevrolet Traverse, but likely fall short of the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer.
Driving the Used 2018 Dodge DurangoThe V8 engines in the Durango get the headlines, but the reality is that the V6 is actually quite good. It can haul up to 6,400 pounds, and it offers smooth and refined performance, the 8-speed proving a good match overall despite the occasional hunt for the right gear. That said, the two V8s on offer are pretty cool. There’s the 5.7-liter version, with 360 horsepower and up to 7,400 pounds of towing capacity. It sounds great, offers quick acceleration and plenty of passing power. Then there’s the new-for-2018 Durango SRT, with 475 horsepower and up to 8,600 pounds of towing capability. It’s even quicker, hitting 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, and it sounds terrific while doing it. Best of all, the Durango — even the sporty SRT model — offers a comfortable ride and quiet interior when just cruising around, with plenty of space for its seven passengers.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Dodge Durango’s interior feels like a higher quality place than many of its crossover-SUV competitors, especially in high-end Citadel models with their heated and ventilated front seats, and heated 2nd-row seating. Most models offer a choice between a bench or captain’s chairs in the second row; the latter makes accessing the third row easier, and makes it easier to use a booster seat. Cargo space behind the third row is so-so, but the 3rd-row seats fold, and you can even fold down the front passenger seat for really long objects. Citadel and SRT models can be ordered with faux-suede headliners.
Exterior StylingThe Durango’s exterior styling is exactly aggressive enough without going overboard, even in base models. The clean lines get dressed up with LED headlight accents, a big crosshair grille in varying trims — chrome or body color — and the rear end sports a tailgate-wide red LED ""racetrack-taillight"" design that’s exceptionally distinctive at night. Chrome fans should look to the base SXT or the especially blingtastic Citadel; the monochrome look on the mid-level GT and R/T and super-quick SRT are more subtle alternatives. The SRT sports a unique hood and front end with extra vents to help cool the big V8.
Favorite FeaturesDURANGO SRT Of course this is our favorite thing about the Durango, and why not? With 475 horsepower, 6-passenger seating, more than four tons of towing capacity, and 0-60 mph in about 4.4 seconds, the Durango SRT is the complete package.
 Uconnect 8.4 The Uconnect system in Dodge (and Chrysler and Jeep vehicles) is one of the best touch-screen infotainment systems available. The latest version revamps the interface for a cleaner appearance, ups the usability, and adds Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. 
Standard FeaturesThe base model 2018 Dodge Durango SXT comes with seating for five passengers, the V6, and interestingly, a Sport mode for a better driving experience. It also comes with a 7.0-inch Uconnect touch-screen infotainment system that includes an AM/FM/CD radio, WMA/MP3 support, Bluetooth, Sirius satellite radio and auxiliary input jack. There are also a tilt/telescope steering wheel and 3-zone automatic climate control, and outside you get 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. Of course, if you work your way up the model line you get more standard equipment, such as a power liftgate and sunroof, navigation, Nappa leather seats, and more.
Factory OptionsChoices facing 2018 Dodge Durango shoppers range from the number of seats (up to seven passengers with the 2nd-row bench and third row), to the engine (a V6 and two V8s) and which wheels to send power to. Beyond that there’s the 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system with navigation, and an LCD multifunction display between the main gauges. Blacktop and Brass Monkey appearance packages add exterior upgrades, while a Technology Group adds active cruise control, collision warning with automatic braking, and other safety systems. For towing, get the 220-amp alternator, heavy-duty engine oil cooler, Class IV hitch receiver and load-leveling rear shocks.
Engine & TransmissionThe base 3.6-liter V6 is a surprisingly good choice for the 2018 Durango. With 295 horsepower it accelerates just fine, has decent passing power, and saves fuel compared to the V8 engines. Optional on R/T and Citadel models is the 5.7-liter V8, which offers up 360 horsepower and 7,400 pounds of towing capacity, along with a satisfying V8 roar. Of course, if you’re looking for the ultimate Durango, there’s the 6.4-liter V8 under the hood of the new Durango SRT. With 475 horsepower it leaves competitors in the dust. All engines come with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and the V8s deactivate four of their eight cylinders under light loads. Rear-wheel and all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) are available, with AWD standard on the SRT.

As the Grand Cherokee nameplate celebrates its 25th anniversary, it continues to improve on its formula for a rugged, powerful yet civilized midsize SUV. Yes, it still offers off-road capability that few rivals outside a Toyota 4Runner can match, all while improving on features more important to today’s buyers like Apple CarPlay integration. This Jeep faces a range of rivals, but none can match its breadth of trim choices or power.
Used 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee PricingThe 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $31,700 for a RWD Laredo model. Higher trims run from the mid-to-high-$40,000 mark, and options can add thousands more. The Trailhawk starts around $44,000 while a Summit begins over $50,000. From there, prices climb drastically for the niche, high-performance Jeep Grand Cherokee variants. The SRT model starts around $68,000, while the new Grand Cherokee Trackhawk begins just under $87,000 and can run to the $100,000 mark with options. While a 6-figure Jeep might sound crazy, it’s also the most powerful and quickest production SUV money can buy, and significantly cheaper than something like a Porsche Cayenne Turbo S. Against more ordinary rivals like the Ford Edge and Subaru Outback, the Jeep starts higher, but it also comes standard with a V6 engine as opposed to a 4-cylinder. The Toyota 4Runner, meanwhile, begins higher than the Grand Cherokee. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Jeep Grand Cherokee’s resale value is expected to hold up fairly well, above that of the Ford Edge, but below that of the 4Runner.

Bonus Content: Find out what it’s like to drive the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk!
Driving the Used 2018 Jeep Grand CherokeeFor all its off-road capability, the 2018 Grand Cherokee is remarkably refined in the city and on highways. That’s a good thing, because that’s where most will spend their time. While the Grand Cherokee’s character varies depending on which engine you choose, all are civilized and easy to maneuver. Steering feel can be too soft at times, and the Grand Cherokee’s tough design can result in wind noise. For the adventurous who plan off-highway excursions, know the GC is up to the task thanks to ample ground clearance and a choice of 4-wheel-drive systems. The Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT and the new Trackhawk bring a different kind of performance to the table. With a 4.8-second 0-60 mph time, the 425-horsepower SRT is sports-car fast. Churning the 707 supercharged horses under the Trackhawk’s hood, we did 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds — even quicker than its stated time of 3.5 seconds. These high-performance Grand Cherokees excel in a straight line, but in corners perform about as well as can be expected of a 5,000-plus pound SUV.
Interior ComfortDepending on trim, the Grand Cherokee spans from a reasonably comfortable SUV to one capable of giving some luxury brands a run for their money. All models are 2-row/5-passenger configurations — there is no 3rd-row option. This layout means good room for passengers and a healthy 36.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats. Folded, that space expands to 68.3 cubic feet. Base Laredo models look the part with cloth and manually adjusted front seats, but stepping up just one trim brings power operation to the driver. Higher-end models are awash in leather and feature heated and ventilated front seats.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV has a muscular, handsome design. True to its off-road roots, the GC has 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with the performance-oriented SRT model sitting slightly lower (8.3 inches), and the high-performance Trackhawk lower still (8.1 inches). The new Trackhawk also stands out with quad tailpipes and “supercharged” emblazoned on the lower front doors. It also gets distinctive red tow hooks, an anti-glare hood decal, and 18-inch off-road wheels. Despite its tall profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, but you can opt for the power-operated liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesJEEP GRAND CHEROKEE TRACKHAWK
A 707-horsepower Jeep may seem the epitome of automotive absurdity — and in some respects it is — but this ultra-performance SUV is still a Grand Cherokee. Unlike a Dodge Charger Hellcat, the Trackhawk has the all-weather traction and utility expected of a sport-utility vehicle.
QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION
Jeep’s new Grand Cherokee SUV offers an optional air suspension with five separate height settings. At its highest, the Grand Cherokee delivers 10.6 inches of ground clearance. At its lowest setting, entry and exit are made easier and aerodynamics is improved. Trailhawks get a modified version for improved wheel articulation.
Standard FeaturesThe Grand Cherokee lineup now spans seven trims, including the new, roughly $87,000 Trackhawk high-performance SUV. Of course, most buyers will stay far south of that. Starting with the base Laredo, you get a V6 engine, new higher-resolution 7-inch touch-screen Uconnect system, dual-zone climate control, parking sensors and a backup camera. We recommend stepping up to at least a Limited model. This adds a power liftgate, power front seats, heated front and rear seats, and the ability to opt for the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 or 3.0-liter diesel V6.
Factory OptionsFrom advanced 4-wheel-drive (4WD) systems to an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect system with navigation and CarPlay/Android Auto capability, there’s a bevy of options available for the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Some can be had by climbing trims. The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, for example, comes with the Quadra-Drive II 4WD, plus creature comforts like ventilated front seats — a welcome feature on a hot day. Our ears are pleased with the premium harman/kardon audio system. Active safety and driving features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist, which can move the vehicle back into a lane if it drifts, and automatic emergency braking if a collision appears imminent and the driver doesn’t take action.
Engine & TransmissionA total of five engines are available for the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but in reality most will be choosing among three. Standard across the lineup is a 3.6-liter gasoline V6 that is capable and relatively fuel-efficient. Optional is a 5.7-liter V8 that is stout but thirstier. We have a particular fondness for the 3.0-liter diesel V6 that is both strong and efficient. Jeep’s FCA parent has filed for an emissions certification, and reps tell us this engine is part of the product plan for 2018 models. The high-performance Grand Cherokee SRT uses a 6.4-liter V8 that spits out 425 horsepower and can blast to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. The new Trackhawk boasts the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine also used in Hellcat models of the Dodge Challenger and Charger. With 707 horsepower, it screams to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds or less. The V6 engines come with rear-wheel drive (RWD) or optional 4-wheel drive (4WD), while the V8 models are 4WD. All Grand Cherokees use an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Grand Cherokee is rated to tow an impressive 7,400 pounds.

If you eye a Volvo S90 or Lexus GS instead, you’ll also benefit from a lower starting price and, with the Lexus, higher resale value. If you want a diesel luxury sedan, your choices have dwindled to the Jaguar XF.",52000,"Driving the Used 2018 BMW 5 SeriesFour different powertrains equal four flavors of the 5 Series. Though small in size, the turbocharged 4-cylinder in 530i models does a commendable job propelling this substantial sedan, enabling 0-60-mph sprints in six seconds or less. Drivers will find more grunt in the 540i and its turbocharged 6-cylinder that cuts 0-60 to under five seconds. The most powerful 5 Series outside of an M5 is the new M550i xDrive, a turbocharged V8 5 Series that puts 456 horsepower to all four wheels. With a 0-60-mph time of 3.9 seconds, it’s faster than the last M5. The 530e plug-in hybrid offers up to 29 mpg combined, but power delivery from the gasoline engine and electric motor isn’t as linear as the other, gasoline-only models. This German luxury sedan is highly satisfying thanks to great steering feel, a quiet cabin, and the ability to strike a balance between agile handling and overall comfort.
Interior ComfortThis 2018 BMW 5 Series’ elegant dash is covered in SensaTec faux leather or the real thing, has a horizontal layout, and controls for climate and audio are sensibly laid out. A 10.25-inch screen relays navigation, audio, car data and more. The jet-fighter transmission lever looks cool but can be awkward initially. The 5 Series executive sedan uses BMW’s latest iDrive 6.0 system, whose rotary control also has touch-based operation (and optional gesture control). The rear seat is roomy, and at 18.7 cubic feet, the trunk is huge.
Exterior StylingThis latest-generation, 2018 5 Series remains quite conservative, and we for one don’t mind that. Mercifully, there’s no gaping grille, just the latest treatment of BMW’s signature twin-kidney design, flanked by headlight housings that now meet each grille’s edge. Overall the 5 Series’ message is one of maturity and strength. On 530e models, there’s what appears to be a fuel-cap door just aft the driver-side wheel. Don’t try to use it for gasoline. Rather, that’s where you plug in an electric cord to charge the battery. The performance-oriented M550i xDrive model has unique, more aggressive-looking front and rear fascias.
Favorite FeaturesREAR- OR ALL-WHEEL DRIVE (RWD, AWD)
Every version of the 5 Series is available with traction-enhancing all-wheel drive, which BMW calls xDrive. This is true even in the 530e plug-in hybrid, and standard in the new M550i, where the AWD system helps put all its power to the ground.
REMOTE CONTROL PARKING
Wanna impress folks? Step outside your car and have it park itself. Once fantasy, it’s now reality in 540i and M550i xDrive models. This feature — commanded by you via the key fob — is especially useful for fitting the car into tight spaces where it’d be difficult to open the door.
Standard FeaturesBefitting a $50,000-plus luxury sedan, even a base 2018 BMW 530i is well-equipped. You’ll get mighty fine 16-way-adjustable front seats, moonroof, navigation system with real-time traffic information, 18-inch wheels, universal garage opener, and LED headlights. Standard audio is a 205-watt/12-speaker system with AM/FM/Bluetooth, USB and something that’s becoming harder to find on new cars — a CD player. As is oft the case with German luxury cars, a rearview camera is extra, as is a genuine leather interior. In addition to its more powerful engine, the 540i does include leather upholstery and opens the door to more options.
Factory OptionsAnother BMW trait is a plethora of options, ranging from advanced safety systems to that diamond-infused Bowers & Wilkins audio system. A variety of driver-assistance systems brings the 5 Series another step closer to semi-autonomous driving. In addition to active cruise control and blind-spot monitoring, the Side Collision Avoidance system can steer the car to evade a vehicle drifting into your lane. The Luxury Seating Package adds ventilation and massaging functionality to the front seats. If you routinely drive in snowy, slick conditions, consider the xDrive all-wheel-drive system. Apple CarPlay compatibility is available, but $300 extra.
Engine & TransmissionFour turbocharged powertrains are available. The base 530i has a 248-horsepower 4-cylinder; the midtrim 540i an inline-6 good for 335 horsepower, and at the top is the M550i xDrive’s 456-horsepower V8. The new 550e plug-in hybrid marries a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with an electric-propulsion system, which can be charged in less than seven hours on a standard 120-volt outlet or less than three on a 240-volt system. The 530e can travel up to 16 miles on electricity alone. All 5 Series models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Except for the M550i xDrive that is only available with AWD, all models can be had in standard RWD or AWD. The 5 Series uses an engine start/stop system to save fuel at idle, but it is defeatable.

Read Full Review","What's New?All-new last year when it arrived in 4- and 6-cylinder form, the 2018 BMW 5 Series lineup expands with the V8 M550i xDrive and 530e, a plug-in hybrid that pairs a 4-cylinder engine and electric powertrain. The 5 Series Gran Turismo hatch is no more. If you want to go all the way over the top, check out the high-performance M5 (reviewed separately).
The BMW 5 Series midsize-luxury sedan entered its seventh generation just last year as an all-new model, boasting evolved driving manners, premium accouterments and the stately style that have made it the automotive prize of executives for decades. In addition to the sporty dynamics and sense of engagement that have long given the 5 Series a performance edge over rivals like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Lexus GS and Audi A6, the latest 5 Series is brimming with technology that can do everything from self-parking to collision avoidance. For 2018, the 5 Series’ initial lineup of turbocharged 4- and 6-cylinder models is joined by the V8-powered M550i xDrive and 530e plug-in hybrid, which encourage even more performance on one end and efficiency on the other.

Driving the Used 2018 Toyota CamryFor as long as we can remember, the Toyota Camry has been comfortable and compliant, but not exactly invigorating to drive. It was essentially the vanilla ice cream of family sedans. That changes with the new Camry. A double-wishbone rear suspension, lower center of gravity and stiffer body structure with a 30-percent increase in torsional rigidity translate to a more dynamic and ultimately fun-to-drive experience. The 2018 Camry feels tauter than the outgoing model, and the steering is more precise. The new 8-speed automatic transmission is a solid partner and in some models can even be shifted via paddles. The standard 4-cylinder engine that powers the majority of Camrys will suffice for most buyers and has a satisfying blend of performance and efficiency. The optional V6, now making over 300 horsepower, can easily chirp the front tires. Our surprise favorite is the Camry Hybrid (see Favorite Features).
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Camry’s 5-passenger interior didn’t get quite the extreme makeover as its exterior, and that’s perfectly fine. The cabin carries over its best traits: roominess, comfort and easy-to-use controls. Regarding controls, small touches like placing the tune/scroll audio knob directly below the volume knob make a big difference. Likewise, the steering-wheel-mounted controls are easy to see and use. Most models have only one USB port, while higher trims are better-stocked with three. Even the standard 7-inch touch screen looks good. In lieu of navigation via CarPlay or Android Auto, Toyota offers its Scout GPS Link App.
Exterior StylingToyota continues to up its game with the Camry’s exterior style, and this newest model is its most daring yet. From front to back, the new Camry aims to show off its newfound athleticism and attitude. Its large front grille is hard to miss, and the Camry’s new, 1.6-inch-lower aluminum hood shows off interesting creases. One of the most surprising features is found on the sporty XSE models, which boast four — count ’em four! — chrome exhaust tips. One of the most distinguishing style elements is the 2-tone Midnight Black Metallic roof, also only available on XSE models.
Favorite FeaturesCAMRY HYBRID
Given Toyota’s massive success with the Prius hybrid, it’s no surprise the latest gasoline-electric Camry Hybrid is better than ever. The new version has a fuel-economy rating of up to 53 mpg, packs more power than the standard 4-cylinder model and is satisfying to drive. It’s the best of all worlds.
TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P (TSS-P)
The 2018 Camry has an impressive suite of safety and driving aids. More impressive is that it’s standard. Even the lowest-priced model has dynamic radar cruise control, the ability to detect pedestrians or objects and apply the brakes, keep the vehicle from drifting in lanes and automatically adjust the high beams.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Camry’s lineup consists of L, LE, SE, XSE and XLE, with SE and XSE the sportier pair. The least expensive 2018 Toyota Camry L is a solid buy that includes automatic transmission, 6-way-manually adjustable front seats, the TSS-P suite of safety and driving aids, and an infotainment system that bundles a rearview camera and 6-speaker AM/FM audio system with Bluetooth and USB/auxiliary inputs. For $500 more, we recommend the LE as it includes a power driver’s seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats, alarm system and 17-inch alloy wheels. Toyota Care (two years/25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance and 24/7 roadside assistance) is standard.
Factory OptionsSE models have sportier exterior aesthetics, 18-inch wheels, paddle shifters, sport front seats and sport-tuned suspension. XSE and XLE models have dual-zone climate control, 7-inch configurable instrument display and 8-inch central touch screen, leather seats, selectable drive modes (Eco, Normal, Sport), blind-spot monitoring, panoramic glass roof with moonroof, and electric parking brake. Among the various options are JBL premium audio system with navigation, bird’s-eye camera, Qi-compatible wireless phone-charging cradle and head-up display. The standard Entune 3.0 infotainment system has built-in Wi-Fi, and while it lacks CarPlay or Android Auto integration, it does offer Siri Eyes Free and Google voice control.
Engine & TransmissionThree powertrains remain available, and all have been revamped. Most popular is the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that now boasts 203 horsepower (206 in XSE models) and earns up to 41 mpg. The most powerful Camry is the V6, now packing 301 horsepower. Both of those engines are mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission. The 2018 Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor for enviable fuel economy of up to 53 mpg. Camry Hybrid LE models actually use a pricier lithium-ion pack, while the higher-trim Camry Hybrid SE and XLE variants use a nickel-metal hydride battery. Toyota reps say the rational for this has to do with fuel-efficiency goals and pricing strategy. All Camrys are front-wheel drive.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Toyota Camry sedan is all-new for 2018. Now in its eighth generation and 35th model year, the latest Camry emphasizes style and better driving dynamics. A variety of trims and three powertrains are available: the standard 4-cylinder, a powerful V6, and a hybrid that earns over 50 mpg.
The Toyota Camry is all-new for 2018, ushering in its eighth generation and 35th year in existence. For its latest act, Toyota’s iconic midsize sedan has reinvented itself with bold new looks and athletic manners. The latter narrows or nullifies the fun-to-drive gap that once existed between the Camry and its Honda Accord archrival, all without sacrificing the Toyota’s reputation for comfort, convenience and ease of use. The Camry remains available with 4- or 6-cylinder engines and as a gasoline-electric hybrid, all of which have been revamped for admirable power and efficiency. The Camry’s driving manners have never been better, but Toyota’s reluctance to integrate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto could be a chink in the Camry’s otherwise impenetrable armor.

Driving the Used 2018 Jeep WranglerOur experience driving the 2018 Jeep Wrangler was in the wilds of New Zealand, where rocks and boulders, rushing water, and rutted and muddy fields put the new Wrangler to the test. At least in theory — the reality is that none of the varied terrain proved much of a challenge to the Jeep. The new Tru-Lok front and rear locking differentials helped make short work of the slick stuff, and both the V6 and turbocharged 4-cylinder provided plenty of torque and power whenever we asked for it. If more wheel travel is required, the anti-roll bars can be electronically disconnected. Rubicon models also come with tubular rock rails in addition to the standard four skidplates for extra undercarriage protection. Yet that’s all expected from a Jeep — what really surprised us was the new Wrangler’s civility around town. The new steering, 5-link suspension, improved body mounts, retuned shocks, and even the drivetrain have all been upgraded for an around-town experience that belies this SUV’s off-road ability.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Jeep Wrangler interior manages to look modern and new, yet retain the kind of simple layout that’s part and parcel of the Wrangler SUV experience. Modern touches like body-color dash panels with round vents flank the 21st-century touch screen, yet there’s still a passenger-side grab handle mounted on the dash for when the going gets especially rough. Base Sport models are a little more Spartan, but upgrade to the higher trim levels and you’ll get such niceties as leather seats with contrast stitching, and even a leather-wrapped dash. Wrangler 4-door models get extra rear-seat room thanks to the addition of more than two inches to the wheelbase.
Exterior StylingAt first glance, the 2018 Wrangler’s styling is purely evolutionary. However, there’s a lot going on that you may not notice at first glance. The Wrangler is more than two inches wider and has more than two inches of additional wheelbase, all in the name of stability and comfort. The doors are now made of aluminum, making them easier to remove. Folding down the windshield only requires removing four bolts instead of 28 as in previous Wrangler models. LED headlights and taillights are available, and multiple roof configurations are also available, making it easier than ever to enjoy the open-top off-roading Jeepers want, but the kind of quick shelter from rain they need.
Favorite FeaturesNEW 4-CYLINDER ENGINE
The new 4-cylinder engine puts out a little less horsepower than the V6, but lots more torque, and with a lower torque peak. Mated solely to the 8-speed automatic transmission, the 4-cylinder is likely all the engine you could need in the new Wrangler, and should get better fuel economy than the V6.
UPGRADED INTERIOR
With new materials, an updated and more modern layout, more passenger space, and even luxury touches like available leather dash and seats, the 2018 Jeep Wrangler moves into a premium territory that belies its rugged heritage. The Uconnect system also comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model Wrangler Sport comes standard with the V6 and 6-speed manual transmission. It also comes standard with 4-wheel drive, in this case Jeep’s Command-Trac system. You also get standard fog lights, underbody skidplates, push-button ignition, and Jeep’s new Sunrider with its clever sunroof panel. What’s more noteworthy is what’s missing: power windows, air conditioning, a touch-screen audio system and Bluetooth are only available as options or on higher trim levels. The Sport does come with an 8-speaker audio system though, with USB and AUX inputs. Wrangler 4-door models come with an extra set of doors, 5-passenger seating capacity, and additional rear-seat and luggage space.
Factory OptionsFactory options include your choice of an 8-speed automatic or 4-cylinder turbo engine in any model. The trim ladder goes up through Sport S, Sahara (4-door only) and Rubicon models, each with varying levels of equipment. The Sport S adds power windows, air conditioning and keyless entry; the 4-door’s Sahara model adds upgraded trim and allows buyers to select the more advanced Selec-Trac full-time transfer case. Rubicon models are the most off-road ready, with tubular rock rails and an even more advanced 4-wheel-drive system. Option packages include different hardtop configurations, an 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system, and blind-spot sensors.
Engine & TransmissionWhile a diesel engine will be added for the 2019 model year, the 2018 Jeep Wrangler offers two engine choices First is the Pentastar V6 we know from so many other Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler vehicles. With 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, it comes with either an 8-speed automatic or a new 6-speed manual transmission Fun fact: This is the only way you can get a Pentastar with a manual transmission. New to the Wrangler family this year is a 2.0-iter turbocharged 4-cylinder. With 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, the new 4-cylinder comes solely with the automatic. However, for the vast number of buyers its likely to be a tempting choice, as it offers more torque lower in the rev range. Fuel economy figures aren’t available for the 4-cylinder yet, but they are expected to beat the V6’s best of 25 mpg on the highway.

Read Full Review","What's New?Virtually everything except the name “Wrangler” is new this year. It’s longer, wider, offers new and updated engines, a wholly new interior, an easier to fold windshield, easier to remove doors, improved off-road capability, and better around-town drivability, too.
The new 2018 Jeep Wrangler successfully blends modern technology with one of the most iconic SUVs to ever travel our roads. The new Wrangler and Wrangler 4-door (which gained fame as the Wrangler Unlimited) retain their immediately recognizable design, yet manage to be all-new underneath, with new engines, drivetrains, interiors, technology, and everything else that comes with it. It is arguably the most significant update ever to this most classic Jeep, but all done without sacrificing one bit of the Jeep Wrangler’s essential character trait: its ability to conquer any terrain, at any time. The solid axles in front and rear, torquey and powerful engines, and versatile 4-wheel-drive system make the new Wrangler unstoppable off road. And yet, at last, the Wrangler no longer feels like it was raised by wolves around town, offering up ride quality and refinement that were once anathema to the Wrangler. With no direct competitor, and 4×4 versions of the Toyota Tacoma pickup coming closest, the 2018 Jeep Wrangler and Wrangler 4-door SUVs stand alone.

The best deals in brief

CPO Sierras are the best of the best GMC Sierra models available, having passed a rigid inspection. They also come with extra warranties and several other added-value benefits.

Driving the Used 2018 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabGMC’s Sierra 1500 pickup for 2018 is really two trucks in one. At first glance, the Sierra is a tough, hard-working full-size pickup posting all the right numbers in the areas of payload, towing and horsepower. But, dig deeper and you’ll find a rather passenger-car-like interior with upper trims bordering on Cadillac-levels of comfort and amenities. The Sierra’s available 5.3-liter V8 fits this truck like a glove, offering excellent power and decent fuel economy. Those who need more can step up to the 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8, but they’ll pay a price both at the dealership and the pump. On the open road the Sierra’s cabin filters out most noise and vibration, and when fitted with the Magnetic Ride Control suspension, GMC’s 2018 Sierra rides and handles like no other truck on the road.
Interior ComfortWith big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, GMC’s 2018 Sierra’s roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be luxurious, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers’ devices. Cab configurations include regular with a 3-passenger bench, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.
Exterior StylingWe dub GMC’s latest styling experiment “contemporary macho.” Like previous GMC trucks, this full-size pickup features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck proud. With the bold styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5-feet-8 inches to eight feet. Double-cab models have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED INFOTAINMENT
GMC’s 2018 Sierra pickup comes standard with a 7-inch audio screen and optional 8-inch version, both equipped with IntelliLink. With up to five USB ports, available 4G LTE Wi-Fi and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, everything stored in your smartphone can now be part of your truck’s infotainment system.
DRIVER-ALERT SEAT
Part of the Sierra’s optional lane-departure and forward-collision warning systems, the Driver-Alert Seat sends a slight vibration through either the left- or right-side driver’s seat cushion to warn when the truck is drifting from its intended lane.
Standard FeaturesEven the most basic 2018 GMC Sierra includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats and a 6-speaker, 7-inch touch screen with AM/FM radio with USB/SD inputs, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a rearview camera but no CD player. Step up to an SLE trim and you’ll get an 8-inch touch screen, cruise control, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and more features. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable pedals and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali’s 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio and leather-clad front bucket seats.
Factory OptionsAdd-ons are available across the 2018 Sierra pickup line. All Sierras can be ordered as 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel (4WD), while those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Options include the Driver Alert Package with low-speed automatic braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, IntelliBeam headlights and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package features off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available for the 2018 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8 and the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. The V6 is linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter employ an 8-speed automatic, but only when ordered with the SLE and Denali trim. All three engines have laudable towing capacity, including the V6’s max of 7,600 pounds. The 6.2-liter V8 can pull up to 12,500 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,100 pounds and a highway rating of 23 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC’s engine lineup. All engines use direct injection and Active Fuel Management, which allows them to run on fewer cylinders and thus use less fuel.

The 2018 GMC Sierra half-ton pickup’s rugged abilities are never in doubt. What may surprise some, however, is just how versatile this big pickup can be. With trims ranging from from basic work truck to the luxurious Denali, the 2018 Sierra 1500 pickup satisfies a broad spectrum of needs and price points. The Sierra does share its platform with the Chevy Silverado, but we think there’s enough visual distinction to justify the two platforms. However, models without the big 6.2-liter V8 lag behind the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 in the areas of conventional towing and payload. On the flip side, GMC’s 2018 Sierra will likely hold its value better than the Ram, and it performs better in IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) crash tests.

ConsIf you’re after a sporty drive that’s as entertaining and engaging as it is thrifty and practical, you may not like the new Nissan Versa Note. With only 109 horsepower, the Versa Note isn’t much of a thrill-maker and its handling is adequate at best. The Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta and Chevy Sonic are much more fun to drive.",16500,"Used 2018 Nissan Versa Note PricingThe 2018 Nissan Versa Note S anchors the lineup with a base Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $16,500 including the $885 destination charge. The mid-range and much better-equipped SV, which we recommend over the S model, is about $17,000, while the top Versa Note SR is about $2,000 more. Those prices are in line with competitors like the Kia Rio, Honda Fit and Ford Fiesta…and that’s a problem, as all three offer more features, more power and a better driving experience, at roughly the same price. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their Versa Note. Strong resale value is another characteristic of the Versa Note, where it’s a best-in-class leader.
Driving the Used 2018 Nissan Versa NoteAn easy car to drive, the 2018 Nissan Versa Note is comfortable, agile and its tight exterior dimensions make it easy to park. Visibility is excellent, and the Nissan’s steering is light but offers little feel. On the road, the Versa’s 109-horsepower 4-cylinder engine could be a bit smoother than it is at high rpm, but it delivers adequate acceleration without using much fuel, and the CVT transmission, which helps fuel efficiency, works well enough in most situations. The Versa’s ride is compliant, even over rough roads. But when compared to cars like the Honda Fit and Ford Fiesta, the Versa Note comes up short. Where those cars are fun, such as in corners, the Nissan is less engaging to drive and it leans hard in the turns and gives up grip easily. The Versa Note’s performance is sufficient for most drivers looking for an inexpensive and reliable runabout; it’s just not a very sporty drive.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Nissan Versa Note hatchback shares much of its interior with the Nissan Versa sedan. Well assembled, ergonomically agreeable and comfortable, the Versa Note’s interior is also one of the most spacious in its class. Rear passengers get 37 inches of legroom, three inches more than in the Chevy Sonic. Headroom is also generous. Its cargo area is big too, with its 18.8 cubic feet and that expands when you fold the rear seatbacks. Although the overall design isn’t very fancy and the materials and accommodations are pretty basic, the infotainment system is easy to use and the tilt/telescope steering wheel and height-adjustable seat make it easy to get comfortable.
Exterior StylingInside, the new Nissan Versa Note is virtually identical to the Versa sedan, but not on the outside. In fact, the exterior design of the two models could not be more different. Where the Versa sedan is staid and slab-sided, Nissan’s designers had a little fun with the Versa Note hatchback giving it artfully sculpted doors, short overhangs and a sizable rear spoiler. We especially like the hatchback’s beak, which incorporates the ""V-Motion"" grille treatment also seen on the Nissan Altima, Sentra and GT-R. From a practical standpoint, the tall profile means it’s easy to get in and out, and the wide rear doors make it easy to install a child seat.
Favorite FeaturesLARGE CARGO CAPACITY This is small car at just 163 inches long, but the new Nissan Versa Note offers an impressive 18.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its rear seats. That’s quite a bit more than many of the Nissan’s competition including the Chevy Spark, Ford Fiesta and the Honda Fit.
 EASY FILL TIRE ALERT This clever system is like a built-in tire gauge. First it alerts you to an underinflated tire. Once you begin to fill the tire, the Versa’s flashers come on to confirm the process has started. Then the horn chirps to let you know the tire has reached the correct air pressure. 
Standard FeaturesThe base 2018 Versa Note S Plus is a little thinner on standard equipment than we might expect, even at its low base price. There’s air conditioning, plus power mirrors, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/Aux audio system, tilt wheel, trip computer, Bluetooth, front disc/rear drum brakes, and 15-inch steel wheels with covers. The CVT is standard, and the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder is the only engine available. However, missing from the standard-equipment list are power windows, power door locks, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver’s seat, or even a remote trunk release, though all are available on the higher-priced SV trim.
Factory OptionsLike most cars these days, options come with successively higher trim levels, rather than stand-alone packages. The next-step SV adds power windows and door locks, a USB input for the audio system, keyless entry, cruise control and a rearview camera. The top SR offers aluminum-alloy wheels and a sportier exterior appearance that includes fog lights, a push-button ignition, a touch-screen audio system with navigation, and the around-view monitor system. Stand-alone options include premium paint colors, and an SV Special Edition Package that adds aluminum wheels and fog lights to that model.
Engine & TransmissionThe only engine available for the new 2018 Nissan Vera Note is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 109 horsepower. That’s not a lot by today’s standards, and it’s connected to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that’s tuned for fuel economy, not performance. The upshot is that if you’re looking for a budget race car, you’ll be disappointed. However, if you’re looking for a powerful-enough commuter, the Versa Note’s 39-mpg highway rating will definitely keep you interested.

A spacious subcompact, the fuel-efficient 2018 Nissan Versa Note is a popular hatchback with small families, first-time buyers and commuters on a tight budget.

Driving the Used 2018 Dodge ChallengerFrom the base Challenger SXT to the ridiculous SRT Demon, all Challengers are satisfying to drive, albeit in different ways. The base car’s 305-horsepower V6 provides plenty of day-to-day power, and you can even get the all-weather security of all-wheel drive — unique to the class — in the GT. Models powered by either the 5.7-liter or 6.4-liter V8 lean more toward performance. That latter engine used to be the top line, and its 485 horsepower moves the Challenger with extreme gusto. These days, the SRT Hellcat and SRT Demon occupy the top spot, with a supercharged 6.2-liter V8. The Hellcat is now available in a Widebody model that adds bigger wheels and tires for better handling, while the Demon is designed for trips to the drag strip. Yet the Challenger — even the Hellcat — is no challenge as a daily driver thanks to its comfortable suspension and relatively quiet interior.
Interior ComfortYou’d never know that the Challenger was capable of shenanigans from its pleasant and comfortable interior. The touch screen in the center is an old friend, enhanced this year with Uconnect 8.4, which brings Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s a retro feel that still looks modern, and we like the big driver info center between the main gauges. No doubt, the thick rear pillars take some getting used to, but blind-spot warning and a backup camera make the Challenger easy to drive. The rear seat can actually fit three across, unusual for this class, and the trunk is actually enormous, albeit with a high liftover.
Exterior StylingThe Challenger’s classic long-hood/short-deck proportions and wide stance grumble performance in every single model, and with their flared fenders and other details, the Hellcat Widebody and SRT Demon shout it outright. Details like hood scoops, badging and optional stripes throw in a retro feel. It just looks cool, successfully fighting the urge to be overly old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern with a timeless appeal and the masculine swagger of an MMA champion. And if that swagger isn’t enough you can also get some of the bright colors with the fun names from back in the day, like IndiGO Blue and Plum Crazy.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE Muscle cars are all about burnouts and youthful exuberance, but the 2018 Dodge Challenger GT adds the responsibility of all-wheel drive (AWD) to the mix. The Challenger is the only muscle car to offer AWD, meaning it’ll be the first choice for skiers and buyers in snowy climates.
SRT DEMON The 2018 Dodge SRT Demon is sold out, unfortunately, but we admire the car for its sheer ridiculousness, and its power. Able to put out 840 horsepower on race gasoline, the Demon is a pure drag-racer, complete with drag radials, a deleted rear and passenger seat, and race-ready driver assists built in.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Dodge Challenger SXT comes with the V6 engine, a Uconnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touch screen that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with Bluetooth, USB and auxiliary inputs, 2-zone automatic climate control, remote start and a host of additional convenience features. There are 16 different Challenger models, each with its own list of ""standard"" equipment, but generally the higher up you go the more stuff you get. Hounds-tooth cloth seats are standard on SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker and R/T Scat Pack models. An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard on V6 models and optional on V8 models.
Factory OptionsThe Challenger GT adds all-wheel drive to V6 models, while Challenger R/T, R/T Plus, T/A, T/A Plus, RT/Shaker, R/T Plus Shaker get the 5.7-liter V8. We recommend the Performance Handling Package for 5.7-liter models to upgrade the suspension and brakes. Challenger R/T Scat Pack, T/A 392, 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker, and SRT 392 all come with the bigger V8 and generally nicer interiors and equipment levels. The supercharged SRT Hellcat and Hellcat Widebody are basically loaded from the factory. The (sold out) SRT Demon is actually stripped of its rear and passenger seats, although both can be added for $1. We recommend the Uconnect 8.4 system, which enhances the infotainment with a bigger screen and navigation.
Engine & TransmissionThe 3.6-liter V6 in SXT and GT models sends its 305 horsepower to either the rear or all four wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 5.7-liter V8 in the R/T and T/A variants makes 375 horsepower with a 6-speed manual transmission or 372 with the 8-speed automatic. The R/T Scat Pack, 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker, T/A 392 and SRT 392 share the same 485-horsepower 6.4-liter V8. The SRT Hellcat adds a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with 707 horsepower, which would make it the king of the hill if it weren’t for the 840-horsepower (on race gas) SRT Demon. All V8-powered Challengers except the Demon can be ordered with a 6-speed manual transmission, but the 8-speed automatic doesn’t shortchange performance. Obviously, none of these cars are fuel-economy kings, although the V6 models aren’t bad.

Read Full Review","What's New?The big news is the 2018 Dodge SRT Demon, a Challenger-based drag-race special with a supercharged V8 engine putting out a whopping 840 horsepower on 100-octane fuel. Other news includes the Hellcat Widebody, which includes wider tires for better handling, and various changes to trim and color, including the return of Plum Crazy. To get a better idea of what it’s like to live with a Demon in your garage, check out our 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Ownership Review.
The 2018 Dodge Challenger is the muscle-car that can do it all. From the entry-level model with its 305-horsepower V6 and available all-wheel drive, to increasingly hairy chested V8 models ranging all the way to the supercharged SRT Hellcat and SRT Demon, this 5-passenger 2-door blends classic muscle car cues and performance with all the modern technology you could want. Its interior offers comfortable seating, high-tech features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a surprisingly quiet and refined ride. It even boasts 5-star crash-test ratings from the Department of Transportation. But lest you think this car is too practical, make no mistake: There’s no Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro that can match the Hellcat’s 707 horsepower, much less the drag-race-ready Demon’s 840 horses. This is as serious as muscle gets.

Driving the Used 2018 Toyota Highlander HybridPowered by a recently revised 3.5-liter V6 mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, the 2018 Toyota Highlander is both powerful and fuel-efficient. Although the standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder, its 185 horses haven’t kept up with the Highlander’s growing dimensions. Trust us, if you carry more than two people, need power for passing and merging or pull a small trailer, the V6 is the engine you’ll want (and need). Still thinking you need 4-cylinder fuel economy? Check out the Highlander Hybrid. It’s combined electric/gasoline motor output reaches 306 horsepower, yet it can travel nearly 30 miles in the city on a single gallon of gas. Regardless of engine choice, the Highlander makes a great family carrier, with good steering feedback, a tight turning radius, comfortable yet controlled ride and excellent crash-test scores. The sporty SE trim delivers the best handling and looks without any noticeable impact on ride comfort.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Toyota Highlander interior is largely unchanged from the previous iteration. We like that there are numerous USB ports, attractive seat upholstery, and a few other selective trim upgrades. All things considered, the Highlander’s interior is one of its strong points. The comfortable front- and 2nd-row seats are great for long drives, and little ones in the third row will be satisfied, although adults should skip it. The dash-width shelf up front is perfect for your wallet, smartphone, keys or whatever else, and the huge center console bin can easily swallow anything too big for the shelf.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Highlander’s grille is huge, following the big-grille trend that’s been stylish for the past few years. Yet it emphasizes the already blunt nose of this midsize SUV, with different models getting different trims, seeming to shrink the headlights in the process. The rest of the Highlander isn’t as dramatic, although the sporty Highlander SE features a blackout trim package that tones down the grille and ultimately looks pretty good. The latest styling trend further emboldens a design that was already a departure of sorts from the Highlander’s bland predecessors, and although the grille won’t appeal to everybody, it’s certainly distinctive.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM
With the Highlander’s Driver Easy Speak, cries of “DON’T MAKE ME PULL THIS CAR OVER” are reduced to a mere vocal warning via an intercom system that allows the driver’s intention to be conveyed loud and clear to 3rd-row-seat occupants.
FLIP-UP REAR HATCH WINDOW
The Highlander’s 2-piece rear hatch offers the convenience of a flip-up glass window. This design makes it easier to load and unload items without valuable cargo rolling out the back, or the family pooch making a break for freedom.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2018 Highlander LE still comes with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, a combo good for fuel economy but not much else. However, it also comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense Plus (TSS-P), which bundles high-tech safety gear like active cruise control, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, and lane-departure alert and warning. There’s 8-passenger seating, standard rearview camera, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, day/night rearview mirror, and three 12-volt auxiliary power outlets (two up front and one in the second row), and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display with Toyota’s Entune audio system, Bluetooth and voice recognition.
Factory OptionsMost options are added by trim level; the LE Plus adds 3-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen display and faux-leather seats; the XLE gets real leather and better infotainment that includes navigation; Limited and Limited Platinum get even better audio systems, heated and ventilated front seats, and even an around-view camera, heated steering wheel and heated 2nd-row seats in the Limited Platinum. A panoramic moonroof is available, plus rear-seat entertainment including Blu-ray and DVD, Driver Easy Speak, and of course the V6 or Hybrid powertrains.
Engine & TransmissionThree basic powertrain choices face 2018 Highlander buyers. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there’s the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, including hybrids, but unless you need the extra traction for foul weather, we suggest skipping it in favor of the better fuel economy you get from front-wheel drive (FWD).

The 2018 Toyota Highlander continues to be the choice for families seeking a safe, secure and comfortable 8-passenger crossover SUV, but one that isn’t boring or lacking modern amenities. After a complete refresh last year, the 2018 Highlander is again poised to take on rivals like the Honda Pilot, Chevrolet Traverse and Nissan Pathfinder. To accomplish this, the Highlander offers a standard suite of driver-safety assists including pre-collision warning and braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning.

Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet CamaroNow in its sixth generation, the 2018 Chevy Camaro is much smaller, lighter and more refined than its predecessor. It still delivers a visceral driving experience that will satisfy any enthusiast, but it doesn’t beat you or sacrifice comfort for performance like some Camaros of the past. The standard 275-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is strong enough to back up the Camaro’s sexy styling, but the 335-horsepower V6 is quicker off the line and offers a more satisfying driving experience. Step up to the V8-powered SS if you can. Its 455-horsepower 6.2-liter engine is shared with the Corvette and delivers serious performance when you want it. And its V8 rumble is intoxicating. With 650 horsepower the supercharged V8 in the Camaro ZL1 will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand tall. Although we prefer the 6-speed manual, the paddle-shift 8-speed automatic transmission is a winner.
Interior ComfortThis is the best Camaro interior since Chevy’s muscle car first hit the streets in 1967. Although outward visibility is still compromised by the Camaro’s high beltline, the 2018 Camaro interior is very comfortable and combines clever design, cool styling and solid ergonomics. The clever design reduces dashboard clutter by incorporating the trim rings around the center vents to control temperature and fan speed. The seats offer great support in corners, and the MyLink infotainment system features a large touch screen. Heated and ventilated front seats are standard on the 2LT trim level. The rear seat can handle adults in a pinch.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Chevrolet Camaro sports clean, tight lines to go with its tidy dimensions, owing a little to the classic 1969 model. Although it’s similar to the previous-generation Camaro, the 2018 model is more modern with impossibly thin headlights, bulging hindquarters and a low-slung roof. Camaro ZL1 models get a deep grille and bumper to cool its supercharged engine, and the 1LE looks equally aggressive with mesh grille inserts, a front spoiler and a satin-black hood and mirrors. The new ZL1 ILE model gets even more aggressive aerodynamics including a massive rear spoiler to increase high-speed stability.
Favorite FeaturesCAMARO ILE Available with a 335-horsepower V6 or on the 455-horsepower V8-powered Camaro SS, the ILE’s more aggressive suspension betters the Camaro’s handling and gives it track-day capability. The package includes Brembo brakes, sticky Goodyear Eagle F1 tires and the ILE’s signature black hood. Recaro seats are also available.
 CHEVY MYLINK Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is one of the best with quick response and a very intuitive interface. It comes with an optional 8-inch touch screen, onboard Wi-Fi and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. You can also connect to your Camaro with a phone app, and wireless phone charging is available. 
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2018 Chevy Camaro is the 1LT, which comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. There’s also a driver-selector mode that includes Snow and Ice, Tour and Sport. The 7-inch touch-screen audio system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual USB ports, aux input, and GM’s 4GLTE Wi-Fi hotspot. Bluetooth, automatic climate control, and a color driver-information display between the gauges are all standard. Upscale features include push-button start and keyless entry, power driver and passenger seats, and a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel. Multiple airbags and advanced stability control help keep you safe.
Factory OptionsOn the new Camaro’s options list are an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, two different Brembo-brake upgrades, an upgraded audio system with a larger 8-inch touch screen, and an enhanced driver-information center similar to the Corvette’s. The Camaro SS adds available magnetic ride-control suspension, a power sunroof, in-dash navigation and a dual-mode exhaust system for more V8 rumble. A remote engine-start system is available. Optional safety technology includes blind-spot monitoring, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, Lane Change Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert, all of which helps minimize the Camaro’s compromised outward visibility.
Engine & TransmissionThere are four engines available in the 2018 Camaro. There’s the standard 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with a muscular 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Step up to the 3.6-liter V6 with 335 horsepower it offers more power but less torque than the 4-cylinder, and offers cylinder deactivation for better fuel economy. But a Camaro needs a V8, and in the Camaro SS there’s the 6.2-liter V8, shared with the Corvette, pumping out 455 horsepower. Step up to the Camaro ZL1 and you’re looking at a 650-horsepower supercharged version, making it the most powerful Camaro ever. All engines connect to a 6-speed manual that includes automatic rev matching on V8 models or an 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters; Camaro ZL1 models get an optional 10-speed automatic.

Read Full Review","What's New?This year Chevy pulled out all the stops and created the 2018 Camaro ZL1 ILE. It’s the fastest, quickest, best-handling, best-stopping and most powerful Camaro ever. It’s a big-winged wonder with special adjustable suspension, thinner rear glass to save weight, Brembo brakes and a 650-horsepower supercharged V8.
Now in its 51st year of production, the Chevy Camaro is sophisticated well beyond its muscle-car heritage. More mature than its predecessors with increased refinement and a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine making 275 horsepower, the rear-wheel-drive 2018 Chevrolet Camaro shares much of its components with the Cadillac ATS. Don’t worry; the 2018 Camaro hasn’t lost its edge. Although it’s more fuel-efficient than ever, the new Camaro still packs plenty of muscle, offering optional V8s with as much as 650 horsepower. Many models are offered, including the V8-powered SS, the track-ready ILE, the supercharged ZL1 and the quickest and fastest Camaro ever made, the ZL1 ILE. Available as a coupe or convertible, the new Camaro competes with the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger.

Driving the Used 2018 Ford ExplorerWhen it comes to horsepower, the 7-passenger 2018 Ford Explorer SUV delivers at every level. The standard 290-horsepower V6 is strong enough for most buyers, and the 280-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder is powerful but also impressively fuel-efficient. Need more “oomph”? Try out the Sport and Platinum trims’ 365-horsepower 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6. All three engines give the Explorer excellent passing and pulling power, while its heavily weighted steering and taut suspension give this big SUV impressive cornering ability, especially the Sport and Platinum models with their 20-inch wheels. Although its high beltline and massive front bumper make maneuvers in tight quarters a bit harrowing, Ford has done an excellent job keeping road, engine and wind noise out of the cabin, and seating is both comfortable and supportive. The Explorer’s adaptive cruise control works well, but we wish it offered fully autonomous braking like the Honda Pilot, not just collision warning.
Interior ComfortThe Ford Explorer SUV for 2018 seats up to seven in its three rows, and the third row offers room for adults. The second row comes as either a 3-person bench, or it can be had with two bucket seats to ease 3rd-row access. Cargo space is generous. We’re happy Ford has moved to using actual buttons for most controls, and also like the digital screen integrated into the gauges. The infotainment touch screen is a large 8-inch unit, and Ford’s Sync 3 is easier to use than before and has become one of the more capable systems available.
Exterior StylingAt first glance, the 2018 Ford Explorer bears a strong resemblance to a Land Rover Range Rover, pretty good company we’d say. Its standard LED low-beam headlights, grille and bumper give this mainstream SUV an upscale presence. It looks more expensive than it is. And its bulging hood, sculpted sides and flared wheelwells add musculature to the mix. No one will ever confuse the Explorer for a minivan. The Sport trim level is the most aggressively detailed with blacked out trim and grille and standard 20-inch wheels, while the Limited and Platinum trim levels dial up the chrome.
Favorite FeaturesENHANCED ACTIVE PARK ASSIST
This clever system allows the Explorer to practically park itself. It uses ultrasonic sensors to help parallel-park the SUV and park-out assist to help drivers pull out of parallel-parking spots. The system controls the steering wheel, while the driver operates the accelerator and brake pedals.
HANDSFREE POWER LIFTGATE
Standard on the Limited, Sport and Platinum trim levels, this feature allows you to open the Explorer’s tailgate without dropping your Costco purchase and pulling the key fob from your pocket or purse. Just a wave of your foot under the SUV’s rear bumper opens or closes its hatch.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Ford Explorer SUV comes in five models: base, XLT, Limited, Sport and Platinum. Base models come standard with the 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, LED low-beam headlights and LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, and a rearview camera that incorporates a washer to keep the lens clean. Other standard features include cruise control, air conditioning, a 6-speaker audio system, and Ford’s Sync infotainment system. Ford’s MyKey allows drivers to program top speed and other parameters to help prevent young drivers from behaving recklessly. Other safety features include trailer Sway Control for easier towing.
Factory OptionsMoving up through the model lineup is the best way to get more on your new 2018 Explorer. The mid-level XLT is a good value, offering leather seats, navigation, blind-spot detection, inflatable rear seatbelts, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a dual-panel moonroof. Base and XLT models can substitute a more fuel-efficient 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, which is standard on the Limited model. AWD is available across the board, regardless of your engine choice. The Sport and Platinum models come with the twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 and all-wheel drive plus high-end leather, a premium audio system, leather-covered dash and other luxury items.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 on the Ford Explorer is fine for most people, offering plenty of power and acceptable fuel economy. However, the turbocharged EcoBoost 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine is popular because it offers notably more torque and more miles per gallon. Standard on the Sport and Platinum models is the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, bumping power up to a more-than-adequate 365 horsepower. With this engine, the Explorer is just plain fast. Sport and Platinum models also get standard all-wheel drive, but Ford’s AWD system and its Terrain Management System with settings for sand, mud, grass and gravel are available on all models. Additionally, all models use a 6-speed automatic transmission complete with paddle shifters on the steering wheel.

A major advantage to the 2018 Colorado: It is garage-able. The diesel engine’s fuel economy is remarkably good, and the ZR2 may just be the off-road enthusiast’s dream.","ConsThe Colorado is nearly 3/4-scale of a full-size pickup, so if you tow more than 7,700 pounds, need larger interior accommodations, want more capability than a small truck can offer or don’t mind parking outside the garage, you’re better off with a full-sized one.",21000,"Bonus Content: Here’s how the Chevrolet Colorado performs against its competitorsChevrolet Colorado vs Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Chevrolet Colorado vs Toyota Tacoma
Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabWe love the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel available for the 2018 Chevrolet Colorado. It is quiet, smooth and refined, with excellent power delivery, and there’s just enough diesel soundtrack to remind that you have something under the hood that you can’t get in a Toyota. However, the gas V-6 matched to the 8-speed automatic transmission is just as satisfying. The 2018 Colorado is responsive with either engine and easily maneuverable in parking lots and through city streets. The addition of the reworked off-roader, ZR2, raises the bar on capabilities to run back-country trails strewn with rocks and gutted washes.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Colorado balances between its needs to appeal to those who might otherwise be interested in an SUV, so it’s comfortable and quiet. Crew Cab models have a rear seat that is comfortable, too, albeit tighter than a full-size pickup. The Colorado even comes with premium features like heated seats, Apple CarPlay, and an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system. Yet it maintains the expected ruggedness of a truck, with tough-feeling plastics, durable seat upholstery, and touches like the foldable rear seat.
Exterior StylingChevy’s 2018 Colorado does everything to attract positive remarks on its midsize-pickup style, but holds back from rubbing your nose in faux-ruggedness, with curves and lines that are softened compared to the Toyota Tacoma. Even the new ZR2’s visual modifications are for function rather than form, so the increased wheel arches, modified bumpers and hood scoop are all functional components. The standard CornerStep rear bumper makes it easy to get into the bed, and we suggest getting the EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate, which lets you open and close the tailgate with one hand.
Favorite FeaturesDURAMAX DIESEL The Chevrolet Colorado (and its sibling, the GMC Canyon) is the only midsize truck available with a diesel engine, and the 2.8-liter Duramax is a prize. Smooth and powerful, it offers a first-rate driving experience along with superior fuel economy. A Smart diesel exhaust brake enhances control while reducing brake wear.
 COLORADO ZR2 Chevrolet pulled no punches with the 2018 Colorado ZR2, adding serious off-road equipment including Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and additional skidplates under valuable components.
Standard FeaturesSure, you can buy the base model 2018 Colorado with its 2.5-liter gasoline-burning 4-cylinder engine, and still get the utility-enhancing CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate and cargo-box lighting, air conditioning, a 4.2-inch touch-screen audio system with USB, and power windows. Those with young drivers will appreciate the standard Teen Driver. Most will no doubt look toward starting at the LT model, which includes an 8-inch touch-screen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an enhanced multicolor information display between the gauges, nicer wheels and interior trim, three months of Sirius satellite radio, cruise control and OnStar.
Factory OptionsThere are two optional engines available for the 2018 Chevy Colorado: the 3.6-liter V6 or the Duramax diesel. Also available is 4-wheel drive with a low-speed transfer case. Like many trucks, there’s your choice of extended- or crew-cab body, plus a standard-length or long bed. Available features include a spray-on bedliner, fog lights, cross rails for the cargo-box storage system and a locking rear differential. The Z71 model offers specialized suspension, differential and underbody shields for off-road capability. If that’s not enough, the ZR2 exponentially expands the off-road experience.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Colorado engine choices begin with the 200-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, which is fine, but you’ll most likely want to spring for the 308-horsepower 3.6-liter V6, or if diesel is your flavor the 2.8-liter Duramax 4-cylinder with its 369 lb-ft of torque. The V6 also comes with the 8-speed automatic transmission. The other two engines come with a 6-speed automatic, or a 6-speed manual in the case of the base-model Colorado. Two-wheel drive (2WD) is standard, and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optional with all engines. Fuel economy reaches up to the segment’s best 30 mpg with the diesel.

These prices are similar to those of the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Hyundai Santa Fe. The Pathfinder’s starting price undercuts that of the Ford Explorer but is higher than the Kia Sorento. The Dodge Journey and Mitsubishi can also be had for less, but aren’t as recommendable. As a smart shopper, you know to first check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Nissan. The Pathfinder’s residual value is expected to hold up well but not quite match that of a Toyota Highlander.
Driving the Used 2018 Nissan PathfinderLast year Nissan significantly increased the horsepower of the new Pathfinder’s 3.5-liter V6 engine and the result is a powerful SUV that’s quick off the line and has no problem getting up to speed. Even at 70 mph, the Pathfinder has plenty of passing might in reserve, so it’s easy to get by the 18-wheeler that keeps creeping into your lane. Around town the 7-passenger Pathfinder returns a smooth ride and sedan-like handling. As with many Nissans, the Pathfinder uses a continuously variable transmission that for the most part does a good job mimicking a traditional automatic. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is the standard setup, while an All-Mode 4×4-i intelligent all-wheel-drive (AWD) system is optional on all trims. The system enhances traction and offers a full-lock setting for use on rough or slippery terrain. Thusly equipped the Pathfinder is capable of very light off-roading, and its hill-descent control eases the vehicle down steep slopes.
Interior ComfortAll Nissan Pathfinders seat seven across three rows, with the second row a 3-person bench and the third row a pair of smaller seats. Legroom is generous in the first two rows, but the last row is tight for adults. Last year Nissan revamped the Pathfinder’s interior and improved its ergonomics with a redesigned center console and a larger 8-inch touch screen. Instead of the finicky, all-touch infotainment systems used in some other SUVs, you can easily tune the Pathfinder’s radio or adjust the volume by twisting a dial. Seating is comfortable, and the driver’s seat is height adjustable for shorter drivers.
Exterior StylingLast year Nissan gave the Pathfinder a nip, tuck and a little front-end augmentation, and the SUV’s new curves and chromed-out V-Motion grille make it look younger and more vivacious. The overall shape is still conservative, even for this class, but it’s attractive, well-proportioned and it won’t look dated before you make your last payment. Roof rails add functionality, and the optional dual-panel moonroof does a great job opening up the cabin, even for 3rd-row passengers. The power-operated tailgate that’s standard on higher trims is now motion-activated, meaning it can be opened with the swipe of a foot.
Favorite FeaturesREAR-DOOR ALERT This clever system can help remind drivers that they may be forgetting something in the rear seat, including children, pets and valuables. If the system detects that a rear door is opened prior to driving, and it is not opened again at the end of the trip, the system can remind drivers that they may be leaving something behind.
 AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING This important safety system is now standard on every new Nissan Pathfinder. It monitors the SUV’s proximity to the vehicle ahead, giving the driver audible and visual display warnings if a potential collision is detected. If the driver fails to respond, the system can apply the brakes to reduce the speed of impact or hopefully avoid the collision. 
Standard FeaturesThe Pathfinder remains available in four trims: S, SV, SL and Platinum. The least expensive 2018 Pathfinder S model comes with a V6 engine, tri-zone climate control, 8-inch touch-screen display with rearview-camera display, push-button ignition, 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, 18-inch aluminum wheels, forward emergency braking and Rear Door Alert. Bluetooth wireless connectivity and a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with two USB inputs and HD Radio are also standard. In addition to airbags all around and traction- and stability-control systems, one notable safety feature is the Easy Fill Alert that beeps the horn when you fill the tires to the correct air pressure.
Factory OptionsStepping up from the base Pathfinder S to the SV trim level is recommendable for both its standard features and many options. Included are an 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, automatic headlights, auto-dimming rearview mirror and rear sonar parking assist. Navigation, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and 13-speaker Bose audio system are also available on the SV. SL models come with the Around View monitor, power tailgate, blind-spot monitoring, leather interior and heated front seats and steering wheel. Top-line Platinum models include intelligent cruise control, navigation, panoramic moonroof and 20-inch wheels. A trailer towing package is available on all models except the S, and a rear-seat entertainment package is offered on the Platinum model.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Nissan Pathfinder SUV comes with an all-aluminum double-overhead-cam 3.5-liter V6 and a continuously variable automatic transmission. The V6 makes 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, which makes this the most powerful Pathfinder in the truck’s 30-year history. The engine happily runs on regular gasoline to keep down operating costs and has the grunt to tow up to 6,000 pounds. The standard setup remains front-wheel drive with all-wheel drive optional on all trims.

For those a little less well off, a more affordable performance-luxury SUV such as the 7-passenger Infiniti QX60, Audi Q7 or Acura MDX might be more prudent. The cost of maintenance for the Cayenne can also be eye-popping.",1050,"Driving the Used 2018 Porsche CayenneThe word ""slow"" has never been used to describe a Porsche Cayenne. Neither have the words “uncomfortable” or “imprecise” or “unrefined.” Cayennes are simply impressive from behind the wheel. Each is a blast to drive. In fact, even the Cayenne S E-Hybrid is a bona-fide hoot, zipping to 60 mph in only 5.4 seconds, yet returning an estimated 47 MPGe in hybrid electric mode. The Porsche Cayenne GTS, with its turbocharged V6, rockets from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds. The 570-horsepower Turbo S hits 60 mph in about 3.5 seconds. That’s crazy quick. However, there’s much more to the Cayenne than outright speed. Cornering precision is beyond what you should rightfully expect from any SUV, and the 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is tuned to perfection. And it’s all delivered with the refinement of a world-class luxury car.
Interior ComfortAs one would expect from a luxury SUV bearing the Porsche emblem, the Cayenne’s interior is second to none. The artistry and aesthetics flow into a functional environment as only Porsche can manage, combining finely stitched leathers, sumptuous wood inlays and metal accents to create a stunning interior every bit the equal of a 911 or Panamera. Rear passengers enjoy a sliding and reclining rear seat, and can view movies on a pair of LCD screens attached to the backs of the front-seat head restraints. Regrettably, the dash layout is littered with tiny buttons and numerous switches that can be confusing to operate, especially when it comes to using the navigation setup. 
Exterior StylingAlthough the 1st-generation Cayenne was popular, it was never going to win any beauty contests. However, this second generation, introduced in 2011, has set the standard for athletic-looking SUVs with its sports-car stance and proportions. From any angle the Cayenne’s muscular curves scream its speed-and-performance mission. A quick field guide to identifying Cayenne models focuses on the brakes: Silver denotes the Cayenne S and Cayenne S E-Hybrid, and red the high-performance Turbo and GTS models. Turbo S models get the yellow ceramic-brake option as standard. Turbo models also get four exhaust pipes.
Favorite FeaturesPORSCHE TORQUE VECTORING PLUSBy sending additional power to the outside wheel while cornering, Porsche’s Torque Vectoring Plus helps improve the Cayenne’s agility as well as its grip on the pavement. Combined with an advanced suspension setup, Torque Vectoring Plus is a big reason why this SUV doesn’t drive like an SUV.
CERAMIC COMPOSITE BRAKESWhen a vehicle can go as fast as a Porsche Cayenne, it’s nice to know the stopping power of ceramic brakes is an option. Ceramic brakes provide better stopping power, less fade and longer rotor life. In the case of the Cayenne, they also come with pretty bright yellow calipers and a $9,000 price tag.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Porsche Cayenne comes in six trims: base, S, S E-Hybrid, GTS, Turbo and Turbo S. Regardless of choice, all Cayenne models feature standard all-wheel drive, a height-adjustable power liftgate, 10-speaker audio with 7-inch touch screen, water-repellent front side glass, rain-sensing wipers and a full complement of power accessories. A fuel-saving stop/start function is also standard, as are six airbags, a full suite of electronic stability aids, and roadside assistance while under warranty.
Factory OptionsThe Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control lets Porsche Cayenne owners take their SUV’s handling to the next level. It adjusts the anti-roll bars in real time to add stiffness to the suspension in response to conditions and whatever drive mode you have selected. A 1,000-watt, 16-speaker Burmester audio system is available for audiophiles, and in-vehicle connectivity includes an Aha Radio smartphone application, which offers a variety of customizable news, music and social networking services. Of course, there’s also that $9,000 brake system.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2018 Porsche Cayenne models come standard with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. However, there are seven distinct engines to choose from. The standard Cayenne comes with a strong 3.6-liter V6 engine offering 300 horsepower; however, it’s worth the extra money for the turbocharged versions, either the 420-horsepower Cayenne S or the 440-horsepower Cayenne GTS. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid employs a 333-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6 coupled to a synchronous electric motor, which brings the total horsepower figure to 416. At the top of the line are the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S delivering a whopping 520 and 570 horsepower, respectively, from a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8.

In the elite world of high-performance luxury SUVs, it’s hard to beat what the 2018 Porsche Cayenne is offering. After 15 years in production, the Cayenne just seems to improve with age, and even with an all-new 2019 Cayenne waiting in the wings, the 2018 model is still every bit the equal of rivals like the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Land Rover Range Rover Sport. Porsche being Porsche, the Cayenne is offered in a number of variations, ranging from the eco-friendly Cayenne S E-Hybrid plug-in to the 570-horsepower Turbo S, the latter a decidedly un-eco-friendly choice. Of course, Porsche does luxury as well as it does performance, so buyers can expect nearly unlimited choices when it comes to interior configuration, color and content.

If you want a manual transmission, try the Accord or Mazda6.
What's New?For 2018, the Subaru Legacy gains new Starlink infotainment systems that include standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and updated grille and interior aesthetics. Revisions to the engine-control unit (ECU) grant smoother acceleration, while other modifications have been made to reduce body roll and interior noise.
The 2018 Subaru Legacy tends to fly under the radar, but a closer look reveals it is a smart choice for many sedan buyers, and the best choice for some. Like nearly every other Subaru, the Legacy’s secret sauce is its all-wheel drive (AWD). While the Legacy has no lack of competitors in better-known rivals like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, only one other midsize sedan — the Ford Fusion — even offers AWD. With the Legacy, it’s standard, which makes this Subaru a favorite in cold-weather states. Far from a one-trick pony, the Legacy also has an excellent reputation for efficiency, safety, reliability and resale value. It’s also among the few midsize sedans left to still offer a 6-cylinder engine.
Used 2018 Subaru Legacy PricingThe 2018 Legacy has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $23,055 for a base 2.5i model. At $25,155, the better-equipped and more recommendable 2.5i Premium is a good value. Legacy Sport models start at $27,205, and the 2.5i Limited begins just shy of $30,000. If you want a 6-cylinder Legacy, it starts at $32,805 and can rise past $34,000 with the EyeSight package. The Legacy’s starting price is just below that of front-drive rivals, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. With production of the Chrysler 200 ending, that leaves the Ford Fusion as the only other mainstream midsize sedan to offer AWD. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Subaru. The Legacy is expected to hold its value extremely well. In fact, the 2017 model took the top spot among midsize sedans in the Best Resale Value Awards.
Driving the Used 2018 Subaru LegacyLike all Subarus, the 2018 Legacy uses a ""boxer-type” engine, where the pistons are parallel to the ground, instead of in a V or vertical. This puts the weight of the engine lower, giving the Legacy surprisingly nimble handling. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder offers similar power as other 4-cylinder cars in this class, but the continuously variable transmission (CVT) actually makes it feel more responsive than you’d expect from 175 horsepower. Still, it’s no rocket with that engine, and if you need more, the 3.6-liter 6-cylinder available in the Limited offers a more robust 256 horsepower that makes short work of passing and accelerating, albeit at the expense of fuel economy. Around town the Legacy is comfortable and quiet, with a relaxed ride, but it still handles quite well in corners. Kudos also to the driver’s-seat position and outward visibility.
Interior ComfortUpgraded for 2018, the Legacy sedan offers a contemporary, roomy and comfortable cabin for its five passengers. Updates this year include a new steering wheel and a new color choice: gray, in addition to the existing black and ivory. The Starlink touch-screen infotainment systems gain size — 6.5 inches or 8.0 inches — and speed thanks to a faster CPU. Our back appreciated the 10-way-power adjustable driver’s seat and its impressive lumbar support that is standard on all but base models, while the rear seat has lots of legroom. At exactly 15 cubic feet, the Legacy’s trunk is big.
Exterior StylingThe Legacy’s exterior also gets a light makeover for 2018, most notably in the grille, which now has the Subaru logo and horizontal lines running through the middle. The Legacy remains on the conservative end of the midsize-sedan styling spectrum. It doesn’t have the pizazz of a Kia Optima or the all-new Toyota Camry, but boasts its own sense of confidence and strength. We think it will hold up well over the years. The 2.5i Sport model goes for a slightly more aggressive vibe with a new trunk spoiler and gloss-black grille. Six-cylinder Legacy 3.6R Limited models include dual exhaust outlets.
Favorite FeaturesCARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO, STANDARD These integration systems for Apple and Android phones are becoming increasingly popular on new cars, but they’re not always standard. For the 2018 Subaru Legacy, they are, even on the lowest trim level.
 PIN-CODE ACCESS If you’re an adventurous type who doesn’t want to be encumbered by keys — a surfer or runner, for instance — this feature is for you. It allows you to leave the keys securely locked in the car and regain entry via a passcode on the door. 
Standard FeaturesThe least expensive Subaru Legacy 2.5i model includes all-wheel drive with torque vectoring for optimal traction, 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, folding rear seats, and a 4-speaker infotainment system with 6.5-inch screen, AM/FM stereo with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. For $2,100 more, the 2.5i Premium is more recommendable, adding 10-way-power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, windshield-wiper de-icer, and upgraded infotainment system with 8-inch display, dual front and rear USB inputs, and 6-speaker audio system with CD player. This trim also offers navigation and Subaru’s EyeSight driver-assist technology.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, Legacy 2.5i Sport models add push-button start, 2-tone interior, power moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror, the PIN-code access system (see Favorite Features) and 18-inch wheels. Legacy Limited models venture into premium territory with leather interior, 12-speaker harman/kardon audio system, power front-passenger seat, heated rear seats, and blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert. Optional on all but the base models is the EyeSight system, which adds features like adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and even a system that automatically brakes when in reverse to avoid a collision.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard engine in the 2018 Subaru Legacy is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 175 horsepower. The upgrade, available only in top-line Limited models, is a 3.6-liter 6-cylinder with 256 horsepower. Both engines are known as ""boxer"" configurations, because the pistons are parallel with the ground, and the way they move in and out is similar to a boxer’s fists. It’s more than just a conversation piece though, as this configuration reduces vibration and lowers the Subaru’s center of gravity for a more planted feel. The standard continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) uses a special shift algorithm, making it feel more like a regular automatic transmission. All models also include steering-wheel-mounted paddles that allow you to shift through six preset gear ratios. 2.5-liter flat-4 175 horsepower @ 5,800 rpm 174 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/34 mpg 3.6-liter flat-6 256 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 247 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/28 mpg

About the only argument against midsize-sedan buyers shopping the Fusion is brand loyalty.",23000,"Driving the Used 2018 Ford FusionFew cars do as good a job of being all things to all people as the 2018 Ford Fusion. It’s one of the few midsize sedans available in all-wheel drive, for starters, and all models benefit from a sporty-feeling suspension and sharp steering. The base-model’s 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine isn’t very inspiring, but it’s not much of a step up to the mid-level models with their 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, and available 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 240 horsepower. But if power is really your thing, the 2018 Fusion Sport offers a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V6 with 325 horsepower and standard all-wheel drive. On the other end of the fuel-consumption scale are two hybrid models, the Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid Energi plug-in model, which like the standard sedan both come in a hedonistic Platinum model. The easier-to-use Sync system improves the driving experience of any Fusion model that has it.
Interior ComfortWhat MKZ? The 2018 Ford Fusion Platinum’s stitched dash, premium leather seats with contrast piping, and many luxury touches almost make that Lincoln redundant. Across the line are other high-tech-feeling touches, like the rotary shifter and electronic parking brake. But along with all the high tech — such as an updated Sync system that’s now compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — Ford remains focused on the basics. The roomy interior can comfortably seat four adults, or three kids in back, and there’s a huge trunk. Hybrids have a smaller trunk, but augment cargo space with a pass-through for long items.
Exterior StylingEven after last year’s updates, the Ford Fusion’s styling bears a favorable resemblance to something Aston Martin might make. The Platinum models, with their extra chrome and unique wheels, look the part of a luxury sedan, while the Fusion Sport models get sporty fog lights, a mesh grille and charcoal-colored wheels. Ford’s EasyFuel capless gas-filler system eliminates the possibility of losing the gas cap, or not screwing it on properly. For EV aficionados, the Fusion Energi models use a lighted ring around the charge port to indicate charge levels, with a fully lit ring meaning a fully charged battery.
Favorite FeaturesPLUG-IN HYBRID VERSION
Even with new plug-in hybrids like the Prius Prime and Chevy Volt in the fray, the 2018 Ford Fusion Hybrid Energi holds its own with 21 miles of electric-only driving range. When that runs out, you still have a gasoline engine and a 610-mile range.
V6 POWER
On the other hand, we’re suckers for horsepower, and we’re down with the 2018 Ford Fusion Sport and its 325-horsepower 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6. Along with AWD and an even better suspension, the Fusion Sport promises Audi A6 performance on, well, a Ford budget.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2018 Fusion S comes with a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission, along with manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, audio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, a rearview camera, and Ford’s Sync wireless communication system with voice control. The mid-level Fusion SE is where it’s at, though, with its 10-way-power driver’s seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system and 17-inch wheels. Higher-end Titanium models come standard with the more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, upgraded audio systems, Sync 3 with greatly improved usability, and niceties like dual-zone auto climate control, leather seating and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsDespite the good standard equipment, there is room for plenty of options on the 2018 Ford Fusion. The Fusion SE is your best bet, with a wide range of options available, including blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning to help expand driver awareness and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. There’s a reverse-sensing system to warn you of obstacles, and an Active Park Assist system will actually parallel-park the car for you. As one of the few midsize sedans with available all-wheel drive, the Fusion is ready for foul-weather driving in Snowbelt states.
Engine & TransmissionThe base front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2018 Ford Fusion S gets a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, but skip it and get the SE and its available 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Alternatively, you could upgrade the SE to the 2.0-liter turbo-4-, or get a Titanium or Platinum model where it comes standard; all-wheel drive is available with the 2.0-liter. The Ford Fusion Sport, new last year, also comes with AWD, connected to its 325-horsepower 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6. A 6-speed automatic is standard across the board. The Fusion Hybrid and Hybrid Energi both come with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor; coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission, it provides excellent fuel economy. The Hybrid Energi plug-in has a bigger battery and 21 miles of EV-only range.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Fusion got quite a few changes last year to its exterior appearance, features and tech. This year it’s mostly carryover, with a new Blue Metallic paint available across the board.
The 2018 Ford Fusion is practically an entire car line on its own. There’s a little something for anybody looking for a comfortable and nicely equipped midsize sedan. The low-end Fusion S comes with enough standard equipment that bargain hunters won’t feel like they’ve compromised, while the higher-end Fusion Platinum comes with enough features to pass as the luxury car the Fusion’s sweeping exterior styling suggests. There are two fuel-miser models to satisfy your green street cred, including a plug-in hybrid. However, unlike its many competitors — the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Kia Optima, Chevrolet Malibu, Hyundai Sonata among them — the 2018 Ford Fusion offers all-wheel drive (AWD) on many models, and a Sport model with a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 engine.

That includes the $850 destination charge; an automatic transmission adds about $1,000 to the price. The new Forte Sedan S model starts at about $20,000, while the top-end EX sedan starts at around $22,500. Prices for the Forte5 hatchback start just over $19,000 and can reach close to $27,000 for a loaded version of the powered-up SX. That’s a solidly competitive price structure for the compact Kia, right in line with offerings from Honda, a little above Nissan and Toyota, and a little below Mazda. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. On the resale front, the Forte models are expected to have below-average residual values.
Driving the Used 2018 Kia ForteThere’s a pleasing and satisfying entertainment value to the driving characteristics of the Kia Forte. This is not a boring car to drive. It isn’t an exciting hot rod either, but the Forte’s steering, engine, transmission and suspension are all tuned well and they feel lively and responsive. This is not by chance; Kia engineers like their cars to have a sporty feel. That said, there are sportier and more thrilling cars in this class. Despite the available 201-horsepower engine in the Forte5, enthusiasts should check out the Mazda3, Honda Civic SI, Ford Focus ST, Volkswagen Jetta GLI or VW Golf GTI for their fix. For the rest of us, the Forte’s 147-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is adequate. The 164-horsepower version of the engine in the Forte LX sedan, and Forte5 LX and EX models is better and it works well with the 6-speed automatic transmission. Around town and on the highway, the Forte sedan and hatchback are all excellent choices.
Interior ComfortMuch like its exterior, the interior of the 2018 Kia Forte and Forte5 is simple and a bit understated, but interesting, attractive and artistically detailed. Control layout is intuitive and the soft-touch dash and high-quality materials add an upscale ambiance. Seat comfort is excellent and four adults can ride in comfort. EX models get standard leather and there are heating and cooling seats available, as well as a 10-way-power driver’s seat with power lumbar support. Even the rear seat offers a center armrest with cup holders. Then there’s the Forte5’s excellent 23 cubic feet of cargo space, in case the sedan’s 15-cubic-foot trunk isn’t enough.
Exterior StylingKia has forgotten how to make ugly cars. The Korean automaker is now a style and design leader, with trendsetting sedans like the Optima and Stinger and cool-looking SUVs like the Soul and Sportage. The 2018 Forte and Forte5 are also lookers, with tight bodywork, LED accent lights and athletic proportions. Kia also gets the stance right, and the Forte looks right on the road. Although the two body styles share a nose, the Forte5 hatchback is the better-looking of the two with its short rear overhang and rear spoiler. Overall, it’s a fresh and good-looking group of cars with a number of luxurious features like power-folding exterior mirrors, puddle lights and illuminated door-handle pockets.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVE MODE SELECT
Much like similar systems found in more expensive cars like the BMW 3 Series and the Cadillac CT6, Kia’s Drive Mode Select system allows the Forte’s driver to choose among three settings, Normal, Eco and Sport depending on mood and the driving situation. Each adjusts the car’s engine, transmission and steering, maximizing comfort, fuel economy or performance.

AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING
This important safety technology is optional on the 2018 Kia Forte S and EX. The system reads the road ahead for obstacles in your path, including vehicles or pedestrians. If it determines a collision is imminent and the Forte’s driver is not taking action, it will apply the vehicle’s brakes for you.
Standard FeaturesAll 2018 Forte sedan and Forte5 hatchback models come with keyless entry, standard Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, air conditioning and a split-folding rear seat. The base LX model Forte sedan is fairly dressed down, even offering steel wheels and a manual transmission. A new mid-level S model sedan offers nicer interior appointments at a lower price than the EX. A full complement of active and passive safety features is standard on every Forte. The 2.0-liter 4-cylinder base engine in the Forte LX sedan makes 147 horsepower, while the more expensive Forte5 LX hatchback starts with a 164-horsepower version.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2018 Kia Forte lineup include navigation, leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control and Kia’s UVO infotainment system. Most of that’s included in the Forte’s Premium Plus package, although leather is now standard on EX sedans. Many features are bundled by trim level, and the Forte5 models offer a level above the sedan called SX that adds a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 201 horsepower, as well as 18-inch wheels. A Technology Plus Package includes a power moonroof, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, push-button start, fog lights, LED taillights and other features.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine for the 2018 Forte and Forte5 is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. It’s standard in the LX and S models of the Forte sedan. The other 2.0-liter engine is a direct-injection 4-cylinder that puts out a more robust 164 horsepower. Transmission choices in the sedan are a 6-speed manual or a smooth and responsive 6-speed automatic. The Forte5 gets just the more powerful 2.0-liter, while the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Forte5 SX can be paired with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.

If you crave the enhanced traction of all-wheel drive, Audi’s forthcoming RS5 looks to be the one to beat.",67000,"Used 2018 BMW M4 PricingThe 2018 BMW M4 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $67,400 for a coupe, while the M4 convertible is notably steeper at nearly $75,000. Loaded, an M4 can reach beyond $90,000. At these considerable prices, the M4 is still in line with the Mercedes-Benz C63. This high-performance German luxury coupe and convertible remain above the starting prices of the Lexus RC F and Cadillac ATS-V coupes. Another less expensive alternative is the new Infiniti Q60 Red Sport coupe. It has ""only"" 400 horsepower, but begins in the low-$50,000 range and can be had in rear- or all-wheel drive. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their M4. The M4’s resale value is expected to hold up pretty well, but still trail that of the Lexus RC F.
Driving the Used 2018 BMW M4The M4 is a ferocious counterpart to the standard 4 Series coupe and convertible. With 425 horsepower standard, the 2018 M4 coupe can hit 60 mph in under four seconds, while the M4 hardtop convertible does it in 4.2 seconds. Precise handling and excellent road feel have long been hallmarks of M cars, and that remains true. On a track it’s a blast but in stop-and-go city driving it can be a bit much, especially with the idle start/stop fuel-saving function. The M4 still offers a manual transmission, and it even features a rev-matching system for more fluid shifts. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is available, too, but in our testing we found it rougher than the automatics used in rivals like the Lexus RC F and Cadillac ATS-V. The good news with the auto is BMW touts the ""Smokey Burnout"" function, which does exactly what you think.
Interior ComfortBoth the 2018 M4 coupe and convertible have seating for four, and like their more mainstream 4 Series siblings, space is tight in the rear. That likely won’t matter much to buyers of the M4, as their primary concern will be behind the wheel. Here the business of serious driving is emphasized, thanks to deeply sculpted, 10-way power-adjustable seats with 4-way lumbar support. The steering wheel is well-padded, and most of the controls are intuitive. The non-gated lever for the automatic transmission can take some getting used to — or it’s just another reason to get a stick.
Exterior StylingThe M4 coupe and convertible look similar to those of the 4 Series, but their unique traits are easy to see if you know where to look. The hood features a power dome that you can think of as a bicep signaling this performance car’s extra muscle. Around back are quad exhaust outlets. While the M4’s wheelbase is nearly identical to the standard 4 Series, this beefed-up model has a wider track and overall stance. The M4 convertible has a metal roof that retracts, while the M4 coupe’s fixed roof is carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, part of a weight-saving effort.
Favorite FeaturesHARDTOP CONVERTIBLEWe like the M4 convertible for the same reason as the 4 Series convertible: It’s essentially two cars in one. Top down, it is a 4-passenger open-air chariot built for speed. With hardtop in place, it’s essentially an M4 coupe.
COMPETITION PACKAGEFor M4 buyers with a ""go big or go home"" attitude, this package increases horsepower to 444, tweaks the steering ratio and adaptive suspension, and includes 20-inch forged light alloy wheels, among other distinguishing factors.
Standard FeaturesThe rationale for buying an M4 over a 4 Series is for its track-ready performance, and to that end every M4 coupe and convertible comes with a 425-horsepower 6-cylinder turbo engine and a bevy of performance hardware. Aside from the go-fast upgrades, other notable ingredients include leather interior with carbon-fiber and black-chrome trim, 16-speaker harman/kardon AM/FM/CD/HD Radio audio system with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, navigation system, rearview camera and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Helpful features include a hands-free trunk opening and universal garage-door opener. Also included is BMW Ultimate Care — three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.
Factory OptionsIn addition to the Competition Package is the Executive Package, which bundles features like side- and top-view camera, parking sensors, adaptive full LED headlights and head-up display. Individual options include Apple CarPlay compatibility, heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging and Wi-Fi hotspot, and power rear sunshade. Among the performance upgrades are carbon-ceramic brakes, while a standard suspension is available for enhanced comfort. Safety aids include blind-spot monitoring and active driving assistant, which has lane-keeping assist and frontal-collision and pedestrian warnings. Various shades of leather are available inside, and if you want any exterior color other than basic white, that will cost extra.
Engine & TransmissionHeart of the 2018 M4 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter 6-cylinder engine that makes a stout 425 horsepower. Opt for the Competition Package, and that output rises to 444 horsepower, while the 2018 BMW M4 CS ups the pony count to 454. A 6-speed transmission is standard and the recommended choice for the M4, while a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional. The M4 remains rear-wheel drive.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2018 BMW M4 carries over with only minor changes. The biggest news is the new M4 CS edition coupe, which packs even more bite with 454 horsepower and slots in the lineup above the M4 with the competition package.
The 2018 BMW M4 is the alter ego of the standard 4 Series (reviewed separately), a high-performance version of the German luxury brand’s coupe and hardtop convertible. As with the 4 Series, the M4 boasts plenty of premium amenities and handsome design inside and out. But the M4’s biggest appeal is its startling performance. With a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine that sends 425 horsepower to the rear wheels and a chassis that’s been aggressively massaged by BMW’s M division, the M4 coupe and convertible boast performance and driving manners that remain benchmarks for rivals like the Mercedes-Benz C63, Cadillac ATS-V, Lexus RC F and the upcoming Audi RS5.

Standard Quattro all-wheel drive and the ability to tow up to 7,700 pounds and blast from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds feel like icing.","ConsIf you intend on regularly utilizing the third row, you can find more space in an Infiniti QX60 or Acura MDX. The Q7’s new cousin, the 3-row Volkswagen Atlas, is a lower-priced alternative with excellent interior flexibility. If you need more room still, look to the larger Mercedes-Benz GLS or GMC Yukon.",50000,"The 2018 Audi Q7 is the flagship SUV from the German luxury brand, a 3-row/7-passenger hauler that deftly competes with the Infiniti QX60, Acura MDX and BMW X5. The Q7 was revamped last year, when it entered its second generation as a lighter, lither and more advanced luxury vehicle. Audi’s largest crossover SUV stands out with its dynamic driving nature and sophisticated technology that touts everything from innovative safety and semi-autonomous driving features to its future-is-here Virtual Cockpit with realistic Google-maps navigation. You won’t find monstrous V8 power under the hood or acres of room in the third row, but if you want a luxury SUV with brand cachet, standard all-wheel drive, sleek design and smart technology, the 2018 Audi Q7 nails the list.
Used 2018 Audi Q7 PricingWith the introduction of the 4-cylinder Q7, getting into one of these Audi luxury SUVs just became easier. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Q7 begins at $50,875, including destination charge. The recommendable midtrim Premium Plus model starts at $54,875. Adding the supercharged V6 to either trim costs $6,500. The top-line Q7 Prestige, which includes the V6, begins over $66,000. All in, a fully loaded Q7 luxury SUV can top $80,000. At these figures, the Audi has a lower starting price than the BMW X5 and 5-passenger Mercedes-Benz GLE, though those both come standard with a 6-cylinder engine. For less money, you can get an Infiniti QX60, Acura MDX or Volvo XC90. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Q7. As with other Audis, the Q7’s resale value is expected to hold up well.
Driving the Used 2018 Audi Q7The first-gen Audi Q7 was already among the most fun-to-drive 3-row SUVs available, and its dynamics and driving enjoyment have only gotten better with this new, 2nd-gen model. That’s what happens when you lose roughly 500 pounds, lower your center of gravity by 1.7 inches and install a 5-link front/rear suspension. On the road, this translates to an SUV that’s supple and quiet in everyday driving, and dynamically polished when the need for speed or a curvy road beckons. The supercharged 3.0-liter V6 is a commendable powerhouse. The new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine packs decent motivation for its size but lacks the deeper reserves of the V6 for high-speed passing and towing. Whichever model you choose, you’ll be rewarded with fantastic steering feel. Opt for the Adaptive Chassis Package available on the Prestige variants, and you’ll get full air suspension and 4-wheel steering that helps slice three feet off the turning circle.
Interior ComfortAudi has a knack for crafting some of the finest yet most useful cabins, and the Q7 is no exception. The interior of Audi’s flagship SUV is highlighted by standard leather upholstery and a recast dash with an A8-style double-inlay design. Logically arrayed controls, a fresh 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel and highly legible instrumentation — both conventional and the via the Virtual Cockpit display — round out its more user-friendly character. The Q7’s new platform expands interior volume and cargo space, which includes nearly 15 cubic feet of space behind the third row. For humans, that last row is quite tight.
Exterior StylingAlthough exterior dimensions and wheelbase on the latest-gen Q7 have decreased marginally, this latest iteration puts a more sophisticated visual spin on the SUV formula while imparting an even sleeker character that brings an impressively low 0.32 coefficient of drag. Up front, the Q7’s prominent Singleframe grille portrays strength and premium appeal, while edgier fascia treatments, bolder front/rear lighting elements and sporty-looking twin tailpipes in back bring it all together. On the practical side, the tailgate is power-operated, and the standard xenon headlights make night driving easier.
Favorite FeaturesAUDI VIRTUAL COCKPIT
This tech option makes the 2018 Audi Q7 dash look like something out of the future. The Virtual Cockpit replaces traditional analog speedometer and gauges with an immersive 12.3-inch digital display. Fully configurable and connected via 4G LTE, it can show everything from Google Earth maps to what’s playing on satellite radio.
ADAPTIVE AIR SUSPENSION
Exclusive to the top-end Q7 Prestige trim, Adaptive Air Suspension is part of the Adaptive Chassis Package that also includes 4-wheel steering. Along with improving comfort and control, it can raise ride height 2.4 inches for better off-road ground clearance, and lower it an inch at freeways speeds to reduce aero drag.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Q7 comes in three trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. With a name like “Premium,” it’s no surprise that even a base Q7 is well-equipped. Highlights include leather interior with heated front seats, 3-zone climate control, power tailgate and panoramic sunroof. The Q7 features a 7-inch center display, 10-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio with USB/SD card inputs and Bluetooth streaming. The Q7’s safety features include Audi pre sense and pre sense city, which can monitor traffic and watch for pedestrians. If a collision appears imminent, the car will warn the driver and, ultimately, apply the brakes on its own.
Factory OptionsIf you want Apple CarPlay or Android Auto compatibility standard, step up to Q7 Premium Plus. We recommend this midtrim model, and think its $4,000 increase over the base model is justified with its navigation system, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, 3D Bose premium audio system and power-adjustable steering column. Top-line Prestige models come with the V6 engine, 19-speaker Bose audio system, Virtual Cockpit, full LED headlights and 20-inch wheels. Options include a superb Bang & Olufsen audiophile sound system, Driver Assistance Package with adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist, adaptive suspension, and rear-seat entertainment package.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available in the 2018 Q7. The new base engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that makes 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. That’s enough for a pretty swift 0-60-mph time of 7.1 seconds, but with more than a couple of passengers and their gear, this engine risks feeling saddled. Not so with the optional supercharged V6, which makes 333 ponies and 325 lb-ft of twist, and has a 0-60-mph time of 5.7 seconds. Both engines are linked to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission, and all Q7s have standard all-wheel drive. The 4-cylinder is rated to tow 4,400 pounds and the V6 a stout 7,700 pounds. Like more and more new cars, the Q7 has an idle start/stop system that can be manually deactivated.

A base Rogue S model (no Hybrid at this level) has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $25,750 including a $975 destination charge. The gasoline-only Rogue SV begins around $27,000, with the SV Hybrid starting about $1,000 higher. At the top tier, the Rogue SL is $32,000, with about a $1,200 premium for the Rogue SL Hybrid. You can add all-wheel drive to any model for $1,350. These prices run fairly close to comparable competitors, with the exception of the feature-richer Kia Sportage.

Driving the Used 2018 Nissan RogueNissan’s special sauce with the 2018 Rogue is its size. It’s perfect. The SUV is large enough to feel spacious inside and substantial on the road, but it’s also nicely compact, so it’s easy to park and it doesn’t feel like a barge around town. The Rogue’s ride quality is excellent, and it gives the SUV an overall relaxed gait, which most buyers in this segment will appreciate. Also, the Rogue’s cabin is quiet, even at highway speeds it keeps the sounds of the outside world outside. Visibility is excellent and the Nissan’s maneuverability is admirable, although the Mazda CX-5 is quite a bit more fun to drive. The hybrid model’s 176 horsepower isn’t a significant boost over the non-hybrid’s 170, but the immediate response supplied by the Hybrid’s battery gives it crisper low-end performance from stoplights. It should also be noted that the Rogue Hybrid’s fuel economy is significantly better than the non-hybrid Rogue.
Interior ComfortThe Rogue’s interior only amplifies Nissan’s reputation for high-quality, stylish cabins. There are soft-touch surfaces, tight tolerances and attractive illumination. The leather-wrapped fully adjustable flat-bottom steering wheel feels good in your hands, and its NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” front seats — leather-clad in SL models — are supportive and comfortable. Legroom and headroom are good in the first and second rows, with an EZ-Flex 40/20/40-split 2nd-row bench seat that tilts and slides fore and aft in non-hybrid models. Cargo room for the non-hybrid Rogue is generous, less so in the hybrid, but the seats fold nearly flat, despite the battery’s location behind the second row.
Exterior StylingIn a sea of me-too SUVs that pack the visual punch of a sheet of blank white paper, the 2018 Nissan Rogue is a standout with youthful appeal and dynamic detailing. The Rogue’s “V-motion” grille treatment, edgy headlights and “boomerang” taillights give the SUV plenty of modern design elements without it feeling overly ornate or tragically insecure. Wheel diameters can climb to 19 inches and Nissan offers a motion-activated power rear liftgate on the Rogue. Standard on SL models and optional on SVs, the power liftgate responds to a kick-motion beneath the rear bumper to power the liftgate open or closed.
Favorite FeaturesEZ FLEX SEATING SYSTEM
With this optional system, every seat in the new Nissan Rogue, aside from the driver’s seat, folds down to accommodate cargo. Yes, even the front-passenger seat fold rearwards, which makes it possible to haul long items like an 8-foot ladder or a serious surfboard.
SAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGIES
Nissan loads up the 2018 Rogue with advanced safety systems. Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Safety Alert are standard on all models. The Rogue SL, which is the top trim level, gets standard Lane Departure Warning, Intelligent Lane Intervention, Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection and Intelligent Cruise Control.
Standard FeaturesThere are few surprises in the standard equipment of the base Rogue S: basic audio with Bluetooth phone/streaming and USB, a 7-inch touch-screen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a rearview camera, EZ-Flex seating, and the flexible Divide-n-Hide rear-cargo-storage system. Also, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Safety Alert are standard on all models. Value comes into play on the Rogue SV models. SV highlights include a power-adjust driver’s seat, 6-speaker audio, heated front seats and outside mirrors, dual-zone climate control plus privacy glass and roof rails. With a Rogue SL, you’ll enjoy leather seating, Bose audio, NissanConnect with 7-inch touch-screen navigation, the Around View monitor, a heated steering wheel, and the motion-activated power liftgate.
Factory OptionsOption packages on the 2018 Nissan Rogue include the popular SV Sun and Sound Touring Package, which adds a laundry list of features including a panoramic sunroof, navigation and an around-view monitor. The SL Premium Package adds a power panoramic moonroof and LED headlights, and the SL Platinum Package acquires 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an electronic parking brake, Nissan’s new ProPilot autonomous system and the peace-of-mind of Intelligent Cruise Control. Last and highest, the SL Platinum Reserve Interior reupholsters your Rogue SL in exclusive tan leather with quilted inserts and unique stitching, and the popular Midnight Edition package adds black trim and wheels.
Engine & TransmissionNissan’s adequate 170-horsepower inline-4 carries over in the 2018 Rogue, as does the Rogue Hybrid’s fuel-pinching gasoline/electric hybrid setup. Both configurations send power to the driven wheels via Nissan’s Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission with driver-selectable Normal, Sport and Eco modes. The Rogue Hybrid is capable of automatically shutting off the engine and just running on the SUV’s compact lithium-ion battery in order to keep the vehicle’s fuel-economy numbers healthy.

A small turning radius allows better maneuverability in tight parking lots, while the Acadia’s rigid platform and Cadillac CT6-derived suspension give the Acadia a leg up over the Honda Pilot and Nissan Pathfinder. Denali models offer GM’s Continuously Variable Ride Control, which further improves the Acadia’s handling on twisting roads and its ride comfort when traversing long stretches of open highway. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is fuel-efficient, but not very powerful. Those who regularly carry a full crew or seek the all-wheel-drive system’s full potential are better off with the 3.6-liter V6, which offers more horsepower and torque with a minimal impact on fuel economy.
Interior ComfortAlthough its absolute scale isn’t as large as the first-generation SUV, the 2018 Acadia’s cabin boasts an even more upscale character helped by a modern design that includes soft-touch surfaces, upgraded trim and active noise cancellation. Despite a wheelbase that now matches the compact 5-passenger GMC Terrain, the Acadia’s architecture still allows for three adult-accommodating rows of seats. The second tier — 60-40 bench or captain’s chairs — features an upgraded Smart Slide system for easier access to the 50/50 third row, and both fold flat to expand the 12.8 cubic feet of base cargo space to a quite usable 79.0-cubic-foot maximum.
Exterior StylingThe recent 2018 GMC Acadia remake introduces a more sophisticated but still substantial look that’s skewed more towards contemporary crossover SUV than conventional SUV. Subtle evolutions of established GMC design cues carry over in its grille, fascia treatments, fender arches and other details, but the Acadia’s bodywork now features rounder and more aerodynamic contours and the windshield has an even steeper rake. The primo Denali amps up its curb appeal with distinctive lighting treatments, shiny 20-inch alloy wheels and an extra dose of brightwork, while the new All-Terrain signifies its adventurous character with black chrome accenting and dark-tint 18-inch or 20-inch rims.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVE MODE SELECTOR Allowing the driver more say in how the engine and suspension behave, the 2018 GMC Acadia’s Drive Mode Selector includes a dedicated Trailer/Tow mode. The All-Terrain trim replaces the off-road mode with a more aggressive setting, while AWD models save fuel with a 2×4 mode that disconnects the rear-drive when not needed.
 ALL-TERRAIN MODEL Think of it as an Outback that can carry more people. The 2018 GMC Acadia All-Terrain features an Active Clutch all-wheel-drive setup for improved traction both on- and off-road. All-Terrain trims include Hill Descent Control to help keep descent speeds from getting out of control
Standard FeaturesEven the base Acadia SL comes with tri-zone auto climate control, numerous power assists, a 7.0-inch Color Touch Screen, Keyless Open and Start, 5-year OnStar Basic Plan, support for Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, five USB ports and the industry’s first rear-seat reminder safety-alert system to prevent kids or other valuables from being left behind. Moving up through the SLE/SLT ranks introduces everything from a power liftgate, 8.0-inch touch screen with IntelliLink and SiriusXM Satellite Radio to leather upholstery, Bose audio and Navigation. The Denali and All-Terrain add distinctive cosmetic/convenience touches plus a full range of new driver assists.
Factory OptionsThe Acadia’s extras roster relates to its trim grade, with no AWD available on the entry-level SL. But the SLE-1 can be had with that, a V6 and a rear-seat entertainment system while the SLE-2 offers Bose sound, upgraded infotainment and the Dual SkyScape 2-panel panoramic sunroof. It offers a new Driver Alert Package I that brings Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Rear Park Assist, all of which are found in the Denali’s more comprehensive — and standard — Driver Alert Package II that adds Pedestrian Detection and Forward Collision Alert with Low-Speed Automatic Braking.
Engine & TransmissionTwo naturally aspirated engines are offered, both backed by a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic. Sole motivator in the base FWD-only SL and standard in the SLE-1/SLE-2/SLT-1 models, the new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder makes 194 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. The first GMC engine to feature Start/Stop technology, it earns GM-estimated 21/26-mpg EPA City/Highway marks in FWD Acadia models and 21/25 in AWD variants. The 3.6-liter V6, optional on SLE and SLT-1 and standard on SLT-2 and Denali, makes a considerably stouter 310 horses and 271 lb-ft of torque but features Active Fuel Management that turns it into a V4 under light loads.

The 3.6-liter V6 is now available on the SLE-1 AWD trim, while the All-Terrain now offers 5-, 6- or 7-passenger seating.
Although not as large or roomy as the first generation, the 2018 GMC Acadia crossover SUV is a better fit in today’s world, with a smaller body that is easier to maneuver and interior accommodations displaying a premium look and feel. The 2018 Acadia wears the same bold GMC styling seen on the Yukon and Canyon pickups, but with a lower, more urban appearance. Unlike its truck-ish siblings, however, the Acadia has a softer side with a taut suspension for better handling and a number of technological must-haves, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Buyers can choose between 4- or 6-cylinder engines, front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), an off-road All-Terrain trim and 5-, 6- or 7-passenger seating.

The hatchback is America’s least expensive hybrid and there isn’t another subcompact available that can match its fuel-economy ratings of 48-mpg city and 43 mpg on the highway. The Prius C also has a stellar reputation for reliability and comes standard with many high-tech active-safety systems.","ConsSome may find the new 2018 Toyota Prius C too small for family use. They should consider the larger and more fuel-efficient Prius, which costs a few thousand dollars more, as well as the new Kia Niro and Hyundai Ioniq hybrids. Both are larger than the Prius C and start around $23,000.",23000,"What's New?For 2018 the Toyota Prius C hybrid hatchback gets an updated look with sporting intentions. Toyota has added SUV-inspired black roof rails, black side rockers and black wheelwell moldings as well as lower-body guards with silver accents. Toyota has also added a standard rearview camera to all Prius C models.
With a 48-mpg fuel-economy rating in the city, the 2018 Toyota Prius C is America’s most fuel-efficient subcompact. The comfortable and sporty 4-door hatchback is also Toyota’s smallest and most affordable hybrid with a starting price just over $21,000. For 2018, Toyota has updated the exterior design, giving it some sporty black trim and a more rugged small-SUV vibe in the process. It has also added a rearview camera to the Prius C’s extensive list of standard safety equipment, which includes a Pre-Collision System with autonomous braking, Lane Departure Alert and Automatic High Beam headlights. Four trim levels are available, which Toyota has lazily named One, Two, Three and Four. Key competitors include the Toyota’s larger Prius, which starts around $24,000, and non-hybrids like the Ford Fiesta, Chevy Sonic and Honda Fit.
Used 2018 Toyota Prius c PricingWhen you include the $895 destination charge, the base 2018 Toyota Prius C One hybrid subcompact has a modest Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) around $21,500. That climbs to around $26,000 for the Prius C Four, still not terribly expensive. Those prices start about $3,000 less than that of the traditional Prius liftback, but for the price of a Prius C Four you can get a well-equipped Prius Two Eco, which gets 58 mpg in the city. There are also less expensive gasoline-only cars on the market, such as the Hyundai Accent, Ford Fiesta and Honda Fit, but none hold a candle to the Prius C’s fuel economy. If gasoline ever rises above $4/gallon, that advantage turns into big savings over the years, beyond any psychological lift you get from using less gas. Before buying, be sure to check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area, and know that when you buy, the Prius C should hold its value as well as the rest of the Prius family.
Driving the Used 2018 Toyota Prius cToyota says the “C” in Prius C stands for “city,” and that’s where this little hybrid hatchback earns its money. In the congested urban sprawl of Los Angeles, the 2018 Prius C is fun to fling around with a playful chassis and precise steering. It feels sturdy, offers impressive agility and it’s confident in the curves. And its compact size makes it easy to maneuver in traffic and you can park it almost anywhere. It’s not as sporty as a Mazda3 or Honda Fit, but the Prius C isn’t a bore either, and the ride is comfortable, even over the potholes of West L.A. If only it had a bit more oomph for passing and merging. Acceleration is adequate, with a satisfying jump off the line. But the hybrid’s 99 horsepower can offer only so much thrust, so 0-60 mph takes a leisurely 12 seconds, and highway passing can be a roll of the dice.
Interior ComfortFar from bare-bones, the 2018 Toyota Prius C subcompact offers the standard Prius’ center-mounted gauges, which take a little getting used to, and multifunction steering wheel that carry over directly from the larger Prius liftback. The Prius C has comfortable and supportive seats up front, and a back seat that’s good for two adults or three kids. Those rear seats fold to nearly double the 17.1-cubic-foot cargo area. Fit/finish is admirable, but there are more hard plastics than we normally like to see. Visibility is excellent, and the futuristic shape of the dashboard and climate controls is kinda cool.
Exterior StylingWith the Prius hybrid and plug-in Prius Prime taking on radical styling cues seemingly brought back from an apocalyptic future by Doc Brown, Toyota has taken a more sporty and conservative approach to the design of the new Prius C. And it’s the best-looking of the bunch. For 2018 the small hatchback gets an updated look with SUV-inspired black roof rails, black side rockers and black wheelwell moldings as well as lower-body guards with silver accents. It works, while its sweeping headlights with standard LEDs and distinctive taillights remain firmly rooted in the Prius design language, and the ""boomerang""’ shape within the rear doors is unique.
Favorite FeaturesTOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P Standard on every 2018 Toyota Prius C is the brand’s Safety Sense P suite of driver assists. It includes Lane Departure Alert, Automatic High Beam headlights and Toyota’s Pre-Collision System with autonomous braking, which first warns you of a potential forward collision and will then apply the brakes for you if you do not take evasive action.   EV/ECO MODE In standard driving mode, the 2018 Toyota Prius C achieves awesome fuel economy and qualifies as a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV). But the hatchback offers the driver two other modes to help improve that performance. In Eco mode, the powertrain’s parameters are retuned for ultimate efficiency, and in EV mode the Prius C can be driven emissions-free for one-half mile.
Standard FeaturesLike other Prius models, the 2018 Toyota Prius C hybrid comes in trim levels designated by spelled-out numbers. The Prius C One comes with standard LED headlights, power mirrors, Entune audio, Toyota Safety Sense-C, a rearview camera, automatic climate control, cloth seats and Bluetooth phone controls. Prius C Two models add cruise control and a center-console storage compartment, while Prius Three models get push-button start. Prius C Four models get heated faux-leather seats and a power moonroof. Audio systems all include a 6.1-inch touch-screen display and USB input, but Three and Four models get navigation and a few other amenities.
Factory OptionsBecause of the 4-tier model lineup, individual options are sparse for the 2018 Prius C hybrid, and are confined to the Three and Four models. The Prius C Three model can be fitted with a power moonroof, and the Four model can be upgraded with 16-inch alloy wheels.
Engine & TransmissionLift the hood, and the 2018 Toyota Prius C will look familiar to any Prius driver. Using a smaller version of the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive found in the larger Prius, the Prius C teams a 73-horsepower, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine with a 60-horsepower electric motor energized by a compact nickel-metal hydride battery located beneath the rear seat. It combines for a peak of 99 horsepower, sending it through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to the front wheels. Normal, Eco and EV drive modes let drivers amp up the thriftiness, from Normal’s already good settings to Eco’s subtle adjustments of throttle response and climate control to maximize efficiency. The EV takes gasoline completely out of the equation for short periods of time at speeds below 25 mph.

Driving the Used 2018 Toyota CorollaDriving enthusiasts aside, most people will find much to like about the 2018 Toyota Corolla sedan. The ride is soft without excessive wallowing, and the steering is surprisingly responsive with good on-center feel. Visibility is also a Corolla strong point, as are its comfortable and supportive front seats. While it can’t compare with the Mazda3 or Honda Civic for performance, the 2018 Corolla SE trim does offer a bit more athleticism thanks to a sportier suspension setup and 6-speed manual-transmission option. A 132-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine is standard on all but the LE Eco model, which gets a slight bump to 140 horses. This setup won’t encourage any daring passing maneuvers, but at least the CVT automatic makes the most of what little power is on tap while maximizing fuel economy. There is a lot of noise at full-throttle, however, but otherwise the Corolla’s cabin is surprisingly quiet.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Toyota Corolla interior may be short on pizazz, but it’s quiet, comfortable and gets the job done. The modern dash design features round air vents, a user-friendly climate-control interface, updated infotainment system, improved and more legible gauges, and a multi-information display. The Corolla’s front seats are comfortable and supportive, and the rear seats are surprisingly roomy, even for tall passengers. Even with the new features everything is easy to use and see, and there’s good cargo space with split-folding rear seatbacks to help with longer objects.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Corolla offers two different exterior designs, reflecting the new model lineup. The L, LE, XLE and LE Eco offer a nose-and-tail treatment that’s distinct from the sportier SE and XSE models. Yet both offer similarities. There are standard LED headlights, with a 2-element version on the SE-type Corollas. The SE-based models also get vertically styled front vents and LED fog lights, plus all-red taillights, while LE-type models use subtle cues, such as 2-color taillights, to look a little more upscale.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE-P
No other compact car offers the standard safety equipment found in the 2018 Toyota Corolla. The Safety Sense-P suite includes pre-collision warning and pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. Better still, the system is standard on every trim level.
INTERIOR DESIGN
For an entry-level compact, Toyota’s 2018 Corolla sedan offers a rather pleasing interior. An elegant dash design is bolstered by an extensive use of soft-touch materials and quality plastics throughout the roomy and comfortable cabin.
Standard FeaturesWe’ve already mentioned the array of active-safety systems now standard on even the base 2018 Toyota Corolla L. Beyond that the Corolla L offers LED headlights, a rearview camera with path projection, air conditioning, cruise control, and tilt-telescope steering wheel with audio and Bluetooth controls on the spokes. There’s a USB port for phone recharging and audio integration, and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display audio system that includes Toyota’s Entune multimedia bundle and Siri Eyes Free, although Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available at all. The 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat and the rest of the interior are upholstered in comfortable cloth.
Factory OptionsCorolla LE models get automatic climate control, a multi-information display (MID) between the gauges, and nicer interior trim. The XLE and XSE get faux-leather seating surfaces and an 8-way-power driver’s seat, nicer instrumentation with a color MID, and push-button start and keyless entry. If you want a “sporty” Corolla, the SE can be equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission. SE models are generally equipped a little better than LE models, offering a color MID among other things. XLE, XSE and SE manual Corollas get a standard 7-inch infotainment system, which can be upgraded with an integrated navigation system.
Engine & TransmissionThere are two versions of the same 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine for Toyota’s 2018 Corolla. The one used in nearly all models offers 132 horsepower, routing it through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), or in the case of the SE, an available 6-speed manual transmission. The Corolla LE Eco offers a 140-horsepower version of the same engine, but it’s no hot rod, instead being tuned for better fuel economy. Fuel economy is good, especially the Eco getting up to 40 mpg on the highway, but these days that’s par for the course instead of class-leading. Some 2018 models may show slightly lower fuel-economy numbers due to changes in EPA testing.

The 2018 Toyota Corolla compact sedan may not be the fastest or most technologically advanced small car you can buy, but its dedication to value, economy and comfort is unsurpassed. For the money, Toyota’s 2018 Corolla sedan offers a spacious cabin wrapped in an attractive body, and a list of unrivaled standard safety features including adaptive cruise control, pre-collision warning and automatic high-beam headlights. A wide model range offers something for everyone, although the Corolla’s standard 1.8-liter won’t impress like the turbocharged engines in the Honda Civic or VW Golf, and its driving dynamics are no match for competitors like the Mazda3 and Chevrolet Cruze. High-tech fans won’t be happy with the omission of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, either.

With quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) standard on most models, the A4 even has a leg up in the traction and stability department.","ConsThe 2018 Audi A4 luxury sedan may be too high-tech for some, and we have no data on its long-term reliability. Those needing a large rear seat might be happier in a Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Lincoln MKZ, while those seeking more performance should look to the 2018 Audi S4.",37000,"Driving the Used 2018 Audi A4If you could peel away the 2018 Audi A4’s cool virtual gauge cluster, remove the adaptive cruise control and turn off the adjustable shock settings, you’d still have an amazingly fun performer. The A4’s steering is precise and perfectly weighted at all speeds, and the sophisticated suspension finds that happy place between a comfortable ride and adept handling. The high-output version of the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder puts every ounce of its 252 horsepower to good use. So good is this engine, that it can launch Audi’s 2018 A4 sedan to 60 mph in just 5.7 seconds. The 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is a sheer joy in either manual or fully automatic mode, and Audi still offers a 6-speed manual for die-hard old-schoolers. Opt for the Prestige trim and you’ll gain access to an adaptive suspension with adjustable dampers that can be set to stiffen for improved cornering.
Interior ComfortWhile the big news is the virtual cockpit, there’s more to the 2018 A4 interior than the tech. MMI is much improved, using a touch pad to make entering addresses a breeze. The dash is simpler as well, with the MMI screen moved to the top as we’ve seen in other recent Audi models. The basics are spot-on, too, with comfortable seats, easy-to-use main controls and first-rate materials. The smallish rear seat, lack of a soft spot for the driver’s right knee to rest, and a sometimes busy virtual cockpit display are the only real downsides.
Exterior StylingLast year’s remake at first didn’t look as if much changed, but upon closer inspection, nothing was left unchanged. The car is a little wider and longer, but with more angular lines around the grille, headlights and details. Take the character line that runs along the side of the car, for example. On the old one it petered out weakly as it approached the taillight. Now it boldly cuts through to the trunk on one end, while in front, the hood itself makes up the upper portion of the line. The proportions are spot-on, and the car looks right from any angle.
Favorite FeaturesVIRTUAL COCKPIT
Audi has taken the LCD gauge concept to the extreme, and its accomplishment is on full display inside the 2018 Audi A4 Prestige. The driver can choose to minimize the virtual gauge sizes allowing the entire screen to be filled with a satellite view of the road. It’s like Google Earth for drivers.
ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
The 2018 Audi A4’s adaptive cruise control can help maintain a safe distance between the car and traffic ahead; it can slow or even bring the car to an emergency stop; it can even anticipate upcoming curves or onramps and slow the vehicle to a safe speed before encountering them.
Standard FeaturesOf course the 2018 Audi A4 comes nicely equipped. Standard issue on the base Ultra Premium includes 3-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, leather seating and a power sunroof. The MMI infotainment display is mounted high on the dash, with the rotary controller in front of the shifter. All Audi A4 models come with keyless ignition, HID headlights with cool LED accents, a rearview camera, and LED taillights above dual exhausts. Other standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, paddle shifters for the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, automatic start/stop to help conserve fuel at stoplights, and Audi’s Drive Select adjustable drive modes.
Factory OptionsWe’ve talked the virtual cockpit to death, but it’s standard on the Prestige and available on Premium Plus models. Also available is a 7-inch infotainment screen, or an 8.2-inch version with navigation and the whole enchilada. A sport suspension option lowers ride height about an inch and gives the A4 more bite in corners, and an available adaptive-damping suspension lowers the car about a half-inch and adds different shock-absorber stiffness for Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. On Prestige models you get the full driver-assist suite including adaptive cruise control and auto high beams.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine size available for the 2018 Audi A4, but it comes in two flavors. With 2.0 liters of displacement, it puts out 190 horsepower on FWD Ultra trims and is connected to a 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission that can be operated in normal “D,” in sportier “S,” or manually through the standard steering-wheel-mounted paddles. All other models have a more powerful 252-horsepower version of the 2.0-liter and include as standard quattro AWD that not only provides superior handling and wet-weather grip, but also accelerates the A4 from a standstill to 60 mph in about 5.7 seconds. The more powerful A4 models also offer the option of a 6-speed manual, the only car in this class to offer a manual with standard AWD.

Some previously optional driver-safety features are added to the Premium Plus, and even more for the Prestige. Also new is a Black Optic package.
Last year’s Audi A4 sedan got a bit bolder on the outside and a lot sportier under the skin. The 2018 Audi A4 sedan continues this trend, increasing the availability of quattro all-wheel drive and packing in more hardware and luxury features. Audi continues to lead the midsize-luxury segment by offering such fantastic features as a customizable color instrument display featuring a virtual speedometer, tachometer and a giant navigation display using Google maps. The adaptive cruise control is also hooked into the system, allowing it to slow down for approaching curves or offramps long before you’ll ever see them. Although not as powerful or fun to drive as a Cadillac ATS or BMW 3 Series, the A4 nevertheless is one impressive European sedan.

If you crave one with premium appeal and a luxury badge, look to the Audi Allroad or perhaps a Volvo V60 Cross Country, both bringing turbocharged engines to the party.",26810,"Driving the Used 2018 Subaru OutbackThe Outback shares its platform with the Subaru Legacy, so it’s of little surprise that it feels like a sedan on the open road, albeit one that rides higher off the ground. If anything, that attribute grants it improved ability to absorb bumps and road undulations, if not its ability to corner sharply. The 4-cylinder engine used in the majority of Outback models is merely adequate for acceleration and passing, and its standard continuously variable transmission (CVT) is efficient but won’t snap off shifts like a traditional automatic. The 6-cylinder engine on upscale models packs good power but also commands a significantly higher price. The Outback’s made-for-adventure appeal isn’t just the stuff of commercials. With its 8.7 inches of ground clearance, fantastic all-wheel-drive system and dedicated X-Mode off-road function, the Outback has the chops to take you far beyond the dirt parking lot of the trail head.
Interior ComfortAll Outbacks have a 2-row/5-passenger setup, and one of this Subie’s best traits is its interior roominess. There’s good legroom in the second row and excellent cargo capacity overall. With rear seats in place, there’s 35.5 cubic feet for your gear. Fold the seats and it opens to a huge 73.3 cubic feet of mostly flat, usable space. Up front, the seats are comfortable and well-supported, and the view out is commanding. Controls are easy to see and access. Lower-trim models use cloth, while higher models are outfitted in leather. In Touring trim, the Outback can pass for a premium car.
Exterior StylingThe latest-gen Outback continues to cross over from a lifted wagon to a crossover SUV. Updates for 2018 embolden the Outback’s attitude. Most notable is up front, where the Subaru’s hexagonal grille now has the brand’s logo and adjoining line spanning the center. The headlights also get a tweak, and available steering-responsive units are now offered. Complementing the Outback’s outdoorsy appeal are roof racks and lower body cladding. Even the doorsills seem to demand you get out and get active: They’re designed to act as a step so you can access the roof to strap on your bike, canoe or skis.
Favorite FeaturesX-MODE X-Mode is a standard feature of all Outback models. It’s designed to help this crossover SUV maintain its composure even under difficult off-road circumstances. On top of that, it includes Hill Descent Control, which takes over braking duties during steep descents.
 STARLINK INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM The Outback’s infotainment systems have been upgraded for 2018, with improvements both expected and surprising. In the former camp, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are now standard. Among the latter, new apps will guide you to everything from birding to parking.
Standard FeaturesThe Outback comes in four main trims: base, Premium, Limited and Touring. Even the least expensive Outback includes all-wheel drive with X-Mode for off-roading, an automatic transmission, 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, automatic headlights, cruise control, 17-inch wheels and 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Bluetooth and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay connectivity. We recommend stepping up at least one level to the Premium, which adds an 8-inch screen, CD player, two more speakers (six total), dual-zone climate control, 10-way-power driver’s seat, fog lights, heated front seats and four USB ports, including two in back. It also opens the door for more options.
Factory OptionsBy climbing trims or checking the options box, you can outfit your Outback with the highly useful safety and driver-assist system known as the EyeSight. The system bundles adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, pre-collision braking and even reverse automatic braking. The available power liftgate has a programmable maximum height, and there’s a voice-activated navigation system. Also available is a leather interior trimmed with classy-looking faux wood on Limited models, along with an upgraded harman/kardon audio system.
Engine & TransmissionSubarus use an engine configuration known as a ""boxer,"" where the pistons are parallel to the ground; imagine a ""V-type” engine, then widen the V until it’s a flat line. This layout lowers the center of gravity, which aids handling. There are two engines available in the 2018 Outback. The 2.5-liter standard 4-cylinder offers up 175 horsepower, while the 6-cylinder version has a much more robust 256 horsepower. Both send power through a continuously variable automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual control, and all-wheel drive is standard. The AWD system includes X-Mode for low-speed traction, and Active Torque Vectoring for high-speed stability in corners. All 2018 Subaru Outbacks are rated to tow 2,700 pounds.

The 2018 Subaru Outback is an illustration of automotive metamorphosis, transforming over the years from rugged station wagon to something more like an SUV. Whatever you label this 5-passenger hauler, it’s been a hit for good reason. The Outback is quite possibly the most recommendable vehicle for the broadest range of buyers and tasks. It’s spacious, efficient, comfortable, a great value in the near and long term, and — thanks to standard all-wheel drive and excellent ground clearance — can tackle almost any road or weather condition. Add in advanced safety features, driving aids and technology like CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility, and this Subie’s recipe only improves. The Outback faces many rivals, from the Volkswagen Alltrack to the Ford Edge, but none have its jack-of-all-trades character.

Throw in upscale features like climate-controlled seats, a harman/kardon audio system and a turbocharged engine, and this budget SUV feels much more premium.","ConsThe new Honda CR-V offers more room and better fuel economy than the Sportage. If you need more space, especially a third row, the Kia Sorento might be a better bet. If you want even better fuel economy, the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid might make sense.",24400,"Driving the Used 2018 Kia SportageIt’d be easy to just point to the 240-horsepower turbocharged Sportage SX as the model to get, thanks to its additional power, but the reality is that few will complain about the standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and its 181 horsepower. It’s a surprisingly eager combination, with the standard 6-speed automatic transmission unobtrusive in its operation, just as it should be. The bonus is that it also gets notably better fuel economy than the turbo. That’s not to say that the turbo’s additional power isn’t without its charms of course, and if you’re looking for maximum acceleration, then the SX and its turbo engine are the way to go. Kia has improved its electrically assisted power steering to the point where it feels more natural than before, and the suspension overall, even in SX models, is smoother and less harsh than in the previous Sportage.
Interior ComfortWe like the comfortable driver’s seat, thoughtfully laid-out interior, and good outward visibility. Thoughtful features include cubbies and other storage spaces, and a 12-volt outlet and USB port for rear-seat passengers. The second row also gets heated outboard seats on some models, a nice complement to the good head- and legroom, and the fact that the seatbacks recline. There’s an available panoramic sunroof, but it cuts into headroom. Cargo space isn’t up to the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, but its 30.7 cubic feet with the rear seat up is still pretty good, and the floor can be lowered as well.
Exterior StylingYou either like the high-mounted headlights or you don’t, so you can make up your own mind there. As for the rest of the stubby little Sportage, we’re quite fond of it. The lines are clean and crisp. The ""tiger-nose"" grille treatment works well here, both aesthetically and in establishing the Sportage as a Kia from first glance. The SX Turbo models get dual exhausts and cool LED fog lights. If you opt for all-wheel drive (AWD) you get a bit more ride height versus the front-wheel-drive models (FWD), and a unique nose with a steeper approach angle.
Favorite FeaturesGLORIOUS KNOBS The Kia Sportage has a touch-screen navigation system of course, but the volume, tuning, and the climate-control temperatures are set with knobs, while most other functions use actual buttons. Maybe we’re old-fashioned, but in our cars we prefer the tactile feedback of a button or knob over a touch-sensitive surface.
 LUXURY AMENITIES, MAINSTREAM PRICE The climate-controlled seats, heated steering wheel, premium harman/kardon audio system and power tailgate on the Kia Sportage were the exclusive purview of luxury cars not too long ago. That they’re all available in a mid-priced compact SUV proves you don’t need to spend premium money to get premium amenities. 
Standard FeaturesThe base Sportage LX model adds stain-resistant YES Essentials upholstery as standard equipment, which includes a 5-inch touch-screen display and rearview camera, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with USB input and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, drive-mode selector (Sport, Normal, Eco), and automatic headlights. The mid-level EX is an even better deal, especially since blind-spot detection, cross-traffic alert, power-folding outside mirrors with turn signals, and glossy interior trim were added to a standard-equipment list that includes a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, power driver’s seat, leather upholstery and dual-zone climate control. Standard on SX models this year is an electronic parking brake.
Factory OptionsAll models offer Kia’s Dynamax AWD that includes locking differential for improved traction on slick surfaces. Beyond the powerful engine, the top-line SX Turbo includes things like navigation with an 8-inch touch screen, lane-departure warning, panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, and auto-dimming rearview mirror. There’s no CD player with the premium 320-watt harman/kardon sound system, but its Clari-Fi technology improves the sound of digital music files. We particularly like the power hatch, which features Kia’s hands-free operation: Just stand near it when you have the key, and the hatch opens automatically.
Engine & TransmissionThe base 2.4-liter 4-cylinder offers up 181 horsepower, which is par for the course in this class. If you need more boost, literally, the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder offers up 240 horsepower. Both engines power either the front or all four wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy isn’t the strongest selling point for the Sportage, whether you’re talking about the standard engine or the turbo. At best, FWD models earn ratings of 23-mpg city/30 highway, while a turbo AWD Sportage gets a middling 20/23. The Kia Sportage can tow up to 2,000 pounds. 2.4-liter inline-4181 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm175 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/30 mpg (FWD, LX), 22/29 mpg (FWD, EX), 21/25 mpg (AWD) 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4240 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm (237 horsepower for AWD models)260 lb-ft of torque @ 1,450-3,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/26 mpg (FWD), 20/23 mpg (AWD)

All that’s now standard on the EX, and the SX now gets an electronic parking brake with auto hold.
With last year’s redesign still fresh, the 2018 Kia Sportage gets a host of updates to keep it competitive with the likes of the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and other compact- and subcompact-crossover SUVs. It all enhances an already compelling SUV, one that more than holds its own against its competition. It sports good value, a comfortable and roomy interior, and a long list of standard and available features, not to mention Kia’s excellent warranty. All-wheel drive is of course available, as is a powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder if you’re willing to sacrifice fuel economy. Now in its fourth generation, the Sportage is actually Kia’s longest-running nameplate, and proof of how far this Korean company has come in the last two decades.

If you find yourself playing the chauffeur and want a luxury sedan with seriously impressive rear-seat space, this is it.","ConsThe aging Infiniti Q70 lacks features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, has below-average resale value, and in general remains off the radar from potential luxury-car shoppers.",51000,"Driving the Used 2018 INFINITI Q70Unlike the majority of its rivals, the Infiniti Q70 continues to use naturally aspirated V6 or V8 engines, as opposed to a smaller-displacement turbo engine. This isn’t exactly beneficial if you want high fuel economy, but it does provide for satisfying, linear acceleration and power output across a broad range. Though it’s an older powertrain, even the 3.7-liter V6 in base models remains gratifying, and its 330 horsepower has plenty of gusto. Step up to the big 5.6-liter V8, and its 420 horsepower can be a startling surprise in what some may consider a sleeper sedan. The Q70 hybrid splits the power difference of the standard V6 and the V8. With 360 horsepower, this hybrid is a potent performer, though with a combined fuel economy of 30 mpg, its efficiency is more in line with a diesel than a traditional hybrid. Speaking of Eco, we continue to bristle at the available Eco Pedal. When engaged in Eco mode, the pedal actually adds resistance to prevent lead-foot tendencies. The Q70 in general favors a more comfort-oriented ride than, say, the athleticism of a BMW 5 Series.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Q70’s cabin has a stately, roomy air to it. Leatherette or genuine leather and loads of available wood trim make this seem like a vehicular boardroom, while the array of buttons that cascade down the wide central console can make you feel like you’re piloting a plane. There are lots of curves and organic shapes, but the Q70’s cabin is yet another area that is showing its age. We do enjoy the driver’s seat. Infiniti cars have a knack for providing above-average driver comfort, and that holds true for this flagship sedan. Rear-seat space is just okay in the standard Q70, while the Q70L’s best attribute and reason for being is its additional 5.6 inches of legroom that add to a total of 41.8 inches. We only wish the rear compartment of this vehicle had other amenities for rear passengers, such as a recline function or entertainment and climate controls.
Exterior StylingThe Q70 is at once elegant, muscular, yet understated. We’re thankful that Infiniti has resisted the temptation to add a gaping grille to the Q70, as has become the trend among so many other luxury automakers. As with its interior, curves and rounded shapes are in abundance. At 196.1 inches, the standard-wheelbase Q70 is already substantial in size, longer than rivals like the Lexus GS, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. At 202 inches in length, the long-wheelbase Q70L has the proportions of a full-size luxury sedan.
Favorite FeaturesPREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNINGInfiniti’s system goes beyond merely sensing the vehicle ahead of yours: It senses the vehicle ahead of that one, too. So if a driver two cars in front suddenly brakes, the Q70 alerts you so you can take action. It’s the automotive equivalent of seeing into the future.
BACK-UP COLLISION INTERVENTIONThe Q70 also has your back when in reverse. This optional safety system can detect cars approaching as you back up, first alerting you to the potential collision. If you don’t take action, the car can automatically brake to prevent an accident.
Standard FeaturesInfiniti’s 2018 Q70 3.7 Luxe sedan comes with 10-way power-operated and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, power moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and power-adjustable steering column with the helpful entry/exit driver assist, which moves the steering wheel and driver’s seat. Japanese ash wood trim is standard, but you’ll still have to pay extra for genuine leather instead of Leatherette. The basic infotainment system now is based around a larger 8-inch color display and includes a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with Bluetooth and USB connectivity. Unlike many of its competitors, this Infiniti does not support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone interfaces. In addition to the extra space the Q70L has heated rear seats.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is optional on all models except the Q70 Hybrid, which is rear-drive only. And extra rear-seat room can be bought via the long-wheelbase Q70L, also available in all forms except the hybrid. Other major options are bundled into packages and include higher-grade semi-aniline leather seating, power rear sunshade, heated rear seats, sport-tuned suspension and Bose surround-sound system. Tech and safety options include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure/prevention system, forward and reverse emergency braking, and Infiniti’s innovative Predictive Forward Collision Warning (see Favorite Features).
Engine & TransmissionThree powertrains are available for the 2018 Infiniti Q70 luxury sedan, including a hybrid gas-electric. The standard engine is a V6 in the Q70 3.7, while a big, 5.6-liter V8 propels the Q70 5.6. The Q70 Hybrid employs a 3.5-liter V6 paired with an electric motor that’s good for a combined output of 360 horsepower and up to 33 mpg. All three engines work with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and gearshifts can be made manually through steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. All models come standard with rear-wheel drive (RWD), and the Q70 3.7 and Q70 5.6 can be had with all-wheel drive (AWD). Aside from the hybrid Q70, the Infiniti is thirsty for premium fuel, reflected in its EPA fuel ratings.  3.7-liter V6 330 horsepower @ 7,000 rpm 270 lb-ft of torque @ 5,200 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (RWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD)   5.6-liter V8 420 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 417 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/24 mpg (RWD), 16/23 mpg (AWD)  3.5-liter V6 + 50 kW electric motor Hybrid system net horsepower: 360 @ 6,500 rpm Hybrid system net torque: 258 lb-ft EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/33 mpg
Read Full Review","What's New?For 2018, the Infiniti Q70 lineup gets revised naming with the “Luxe” designation added to models. Otherwise, the biggest change is a standard 8-inch touch-screen display that replaces the former 7-inch screen on lower trims.
The 2018 Infiniti Q70 is the flagship sedan from Nissan’s luxury division. Known until a few years ago as the M, this premium-midsize sedan is available in standard form as the Q70 or the long-wheelbase Q70L, which has an additional 5.6 inches of legroom in its spacious rear seat. As a rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive sports sedan with choice of V6, V8 or hybrid powertrains, the Q70 pits itself against luxury rivals like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Lexus GS. The Infiniti Q70 has strong powertrains and some innovative safety features, but it ultimately falls short against fresher, more sophisticated and better-established rivals.

The midgrade  LT comes in at about $53,500 and its much longer list of standard features makes it worth the additional money. For all the leather and chrome glitz you can handle this side of a Cadillac Escalade, the Premier starts at about $63,000. If you want 4WD on your Tahoe, add another $3,000. That’s quite a bit more than the Nissan Armada, and even the Toyota Sequoia; however, the larger and newly redesigned Ford Expedition has a higher starting price. Resale is another consideration; the Tahoe beats the Ford and Nissan, but generally isn’t quite up to the Sequoia’s. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Tahoe.
Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet TahoeFull-size SUVs like the 2018 Chevy Tahoe are still the kings of the urban jungle. Which is exactly what you feel like perched up high behind its leather-wrapped steering wheel. The big 5.3-liter V8 even roars like a lion. The days of the truck-like SUV that rides like a tractor are long gone. The new Tahoe is big, but it’s a pussycat from inside its luxurious interior. Visibility is excellent, its steering is light and its cabin is exceptionally quiet. The Tahoe also rides admirably, despite its antiquated solid-axle rear suspension. Order the 22-inch wheels and you will sacrifice some ride comfort, but with the available Magnetic Ride Control (MRC), which continually adjusts the shocks to the conditions, it’s a smooth ride, even in the way-back third row. The V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission work well together, and deliver acceleration and passing power that will make you smile.
Interior ComfortThe Tahoe’s comfortable driver’s seat adjusts multiple ways. Combine that seat with the standard tilt steering (and telescoping in LT and Premier trims) wheel and the optional power-adjustable pedals, it’s easy to find a sweet spot. The materials are overwhelmingly upscale, and the controls are easy to find and figure out. The large 8-inch touch screen is as easy to use as any smartphone. While the column-mount gearshift lever is oddly old-school, it opens up the console for massive storage. Adults will wish the second row adjusted fore and back, not just for seatback angle. The third row can handle adults but is best for kids. In the new Tahoe Custom, the third row is removed entirely, which opens up 54 cubic feet a space — a couple more than standard models with the third row folded.
Exterior StylingYou immediately know it’s a Chevy, with the big bow tie on the grille, and you immediately know it’s a big truck. But you’d be forgiven if you didn’t realize the new Tahoe was still based on Chevy’s full-size Silverado pickup, as they share zero body panels. The Tahoe and GMC Yukon are also twins under the skin. We like the Tahoe’s sharp-edged styling, sculpted flanks, and new LED daytime running lights. The Tahoe looks wider than its GMC Yukon cousin thanks to the wide grille that blends into the headlights. Shorter drivers will love the available power running boards.
Favorite FeaturesCHEVY MYLINK Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is one of the easiest to use and quicker-responding systems available. With detailed graphics and an intuitive 8-inch touch-screen interface, the system offers onboard 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, voice activation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. An easily navigated Navigation system is also available.
 TEEN DRIVER TECHNOLOGY Exclusive to Chevy’s products, this clever system sends you updates on your teen’s driving habits. It also disables the SUV’s sound system until the front-seat occupants have buckled their seatbelts, and it allows you to set a speed alert and a volume limit on the Tahoe’s audio system.
Standard FeaturesThe standard engine in the 2018 Tahoe is a 5.3-liter V8 connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Opt for the basic LS and you still get a nicely equipped SUV. There are cloth seats, a 6-speaker audio system that includes Bluetooth streaming plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control, a rearview camera, and rear parking sensors. There’s also Teen Driver, which helps you monitor and set limits on your younger driver’s activities. Along with airbags, anti-lock brakes and stability control, the Tahoe comes standard with a full suite of OnStar automatic crash response and other safety features.
Factory OptionsYou can snuggle with your sweetie as you drive the 2018 Tahoe LS thanks to the available front bench seat. The mid-level LT can be equipped with almost everything available on the higher-level Premier thanks to the LT’s Luxury Package, which adds leather seating and more. The Premier comes only with seats for seven, while the LT can still seat up to eight. Tech-based active safety systems like Forward Collision Alert, Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking, Lane Keep Assist, Blind Spot Alert and Safety Alert Seat are also offered. And of course, 4-wheel drive with a low range is available.
Engine & TransmissionTwo V8 engines are available in the new 2018 Chevy Tahoe. Most are powered by a 5.3-liter 355-horsepower V8 with high-tech fuel injection that enhances both fuel economy and power; it also features GM’s Active Cylinder Management, which imperceptibly shuts off half the cylinders under steady cruise to help preserve fuel. This engine works with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and while it’s certainly smooth and seamless, we do wish GM would offer the excellent 8-speed automatic that’s available in some Silverado pickup models. Order the RST special edition and opt for the Performance Package, and the Tahoe gets the 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 and 10-speed automatic from the Cadillac Escalade. Two- and 4-wheel drive with a proper low range for real off-road duty are available.

We think it’s an acceptable trade-off so long as the road remains fairly smooth. Infiniti has taken a rather aggressive approach toward the QX60’s suspension tuning, a bonus when speeding through winding back roads and mountain passes, but a bit of a drawback when encountering rough or pothole-packed pavement. The 295-horsepower V6 is admirable in both its ability to move the QX60 and its fuel consumption, and while the 4-cylinder hybrid version offers about 5-mpg-better city fuel economy, it surrenders 45 horsepower in the bargain. We find it odd that while driver-assist systems such as collision avoidance, lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control are available, they’re not standard.
Interior ComfortThe midsize-luxury, crossover-SUV segment has plenty of 3-row vehicles, but Infiniti’s 2018 QX60 luxury SUV stands out because its plush, leather-lined cabin is comfortable in all seven spots. The comfortable front seats make highway miles go by in a flash, and climate, audio and navigation controls are easy to reach and use. The third row is surprisingly accommodating for two adults and, thanks to a second row that slides fore and aft, getting there is easy. Infiniti makes the interior even more pleasing with ample soft-touch materials, and by using laminated glass to make the interior quieter.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Infiniti QX60’s rounded, sleek design wears the company’s signature headlight-and-grille design, which works well with the overall design. The side view shows a gently sloping roof, but that design doesn’t negatively affect the QX60’s impressive interior room. One of the key styling cues of the QX60 is the bowed window frame at the back of the side windows. A smaller version of this design detail can also be seen on Infiniti’s stunning Q60 coupe. In back, the power-operated tailgate, which comes standard, makes it easier to load and unload gear and groceries.
Favorite FeaturesPREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING Infiniti takes forward-collision-warning technology a step further by monitoring two cars ahead. The system is able to react to any sudden braking situation that may occur with the car directly in front of yours, thus speeding up the emergency braking system’s response time.
 DISTANCE CONTROL ASSIST Stop-and-go traffic at any hour is now a reality we all have to live with. Distance Control Assist makes life a little bit easier by keeping an appropriate distance between you and the vehicle ahead. It’s an invaluable aid should traffic halt while your attention is momentarily elsewhere.
Standard FeaturesBuyers expect a luxury SUV to come equipped with a bevy of standard features. And even the least expensive QX60 is nicely appointed, with features like heated, power-folding side mirrors; moonroof, and a power liftgate. Inside, all QX60s come with a leather interior with heated and power-adjustable front seats, tri-zone temperature control, Bluetooth and USB ports, power tilt/telescoping steering column, rearview camera with 7-inch screen and 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio. Some optional features in the regular QX60 are standard in the Hybrid, which also has a system that emits a sound to notify pedestrians that the otherwise hushed vehicle is there.
Factory OptionsYou can choose gas or hybrid, and front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), but many of the other options are bundled into packages. Navigation is optional, as are a 15-speaker Bose audio system, heated seats in the second row, a motion-activated power liftgate, Wi-Fi, auto high beams, heated steering wheel, a moonroof over the second and third rows and a rear-seat entertainment package. There are also a lot of available safety features, including blind-spot monitoring, intelligent cruise control, lane-departure warning and prevention, and systems that can automatically apply the brakes when traveling in both forward and reverse.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Infiniti QX60 is powered by a smooth, 295-horsepower V6 linked to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). This Infiniti has a Drive Mode Selector, which offers four modes — Standard, Sport, Eco and Snow. The transmission also has a manual mode that simulates shifting gears. Under the hood of the 2018 QX60 Hybrid, you’ll find a 2.5-liter supercharged 4-cylinder engine that, in combination with a 15kW electric motor, has a net power output of 250 horsepower. It, too, is fitted with a CVT. Whether you are looking at the V6 version of the QX60 or the hybrid, you can choose between FWD and AWD.

The 2018 Infiniti QX60 offers room for seven, a dynamic exterior and a sumptuous interior all wrapped in a manageably sized luxury SUV. Available with the latest technology and safety innovations, the QX60 represents a viable alternative to the more conservatively styled Audi Q7 and Acura MDX, as well as the more expensive Mercedes-Benz GLS. The QX60’s athletic suspension setup delivers a firmer ride than that of the Buick Enclave or Lexus RXL, but the reward is superior handling and cornering. Infiniti provides the QX60’s owner a choice of drivetrains including the option of all-wheel drive and a hybrid model. As gasoline looks to remain cheap, however, we think most buyers will be more than satisfied with the potent 295-horsepower gasoline V6.

Its standard V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds, and the optional 3rd-row seat expands the 4Runner’s passenger complement to seven.","ConsIf you need an all-wheel-drive SUV that places a premium on safety, comfort and drivability, a GMC Acadia or Honda Pilot makes a better choice. Toyota’s 2018 4Runner isn’t cheap, so if money is a factor, buying a base Jeep Wrangler Unlimited will save you about $6,000.",6000,"What's New?New for the 2018 Toyota 4Runner are the Wilderness and TRD Enhancement packages. The Wilderness package brings roof-rack crossbars, all-weather floor mats and cargo tray, while the TRD Enhancement adds 17-inch matte-gray off-road wheels and a TRD-stamped aluminum front skidplate.
The 2018 Toyota 4Runner SUV continues its dominance over a rapidly shrinking field of body-on-frame midsize SUVs. Rugged, reliable and highly valued, the 5-7-passenger Toyota 4Runner feels right at home on paved roads, although its ride and handling are nowhere near as good as that of the Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder or GMC Acadia. Then again, none of these competitors can venture to the off-road destinations a 4Runner can access, although they can match or exceed the 4Runner’s 5,000-pound tow rating. And while we admire the 4Runner’s numerous accolades, its aging design precludes it from offering the latest safety and driver-assist features such as forward-collision mitigation and blind-spot monitoring.
Used 2018 Toyota 4Runner PricingToyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $35,500 for a base 2WD SR5 model. TRD models begin closer to $38,500 and Limited models start around $43,750. The TRD Pro Series starts close to $43,700. At its starting price, the 4Runner costs more than the Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer and Kia Sorento, though those three are car-based crossover SUVs not meant for serious off-roading. The Jeep Wrangler Unlimited is a more like-minded competitor, but again, all have starting prices several thousand dollars below that of the 4Runner. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Toyota. In long-term value, the 4Runner is a Best Resale Value Award winner, with predicted residuals near those of the stellar Jeep Wrangler.
Driving the Used 2018 Toyota 4RunnerYou’ll get no argument from us that the 2018 Toyota 4Runner drives more like a pickup truck than a car, but that doesn’t mean its ride is unbearable or even uncivilized. Over smooth pavement the 4Runner exhibits good road manners, although its cornering abilities do result in noticeable lean. The 4Runner’s 270-horsepower V6 is a marvelous engine, delivering ample power for passing, merging and towing. Fuel economy, on the other hand, is rather dismal, especially when compared with other midsize SUVs in this class; blame the 5-speed automatic and the 4Runner’s excessive weight. Another weak spot we found is the 4Runner’s brake pedal that at first feels a bit soft, but after applying more pressure, causes the brakes to grab too quickly. Off-road, Toyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV exhibits amazing capabilities. Its narrow body and up to 9.6 inches of ground clearance make it easy to move through rugged trails.
Interior ComfortAlthough rather simple, the 2018 4Runner’s cabin is roomy and versatile. The 4Runner’s large dials and buttons operating everything from the radio to the low-range gearing are a cinch to use. The large center console has an available 120V AC power outlet, helpful for charging accessories. The power-adjustable front seats are comfortable and supportive. In back, a 40/20/40-split seat offers numerous cargo/seating configurations and reclines. Seven-passenger seating is available in SR5 and Limited trims, though the small third row is best suited for children. Folding the rear seats yields a flat floor and nearly 90 cubic feet of cargo space.
Exterior StylingNot much has changed on the outside for the 2018 4Runner. In an effort to give the SUV a ""more rugged and aggressive appearance,"" Toyota has endowed the front fascia with large, boomerang-shaped indentations below the slanted headlights. If that gaping design is a deterrent, know that it doesn’t apply to the top-line Limited edition. The rest of the 4Runner successfully carries on the SUV’s rugged, boxy shape. We dig the 4-wheel-drive TRD model’s hood scoop and additional ground clearance that totals 9.6 inches. All trims feature a standard roof rack.
Favorite FeaturesREAR LIFTGATE POWER WINDOWToyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV features a power-retractable rear window incorporated into the rear liftgate. Lowering the window allows cargo or gear to more easily be loaded into the cargo bay. Should caked-on dust or mud impede rear visibility, the driver can simply lower the rear window.
TRD PRO SERIESThe TRD Pro Series equips the 4Runner with Nitto Terra Grappler tires, Bilstein custom off-road shocks and additional skidplating, helping the 4Runner to tackle the most stubborn off-road obstacles. For 2018, a TRD Pro exclusive Calvary Blue paint is offered.
Standard FeaturesToyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV is available in six trims: SR5, SR5 Premium, Limited, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium and TRD Pro Series. The base SR5 includes Entune Audio Plus with Connected Navigation app and Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth music streaming, rearview camera and an 8-way-power driver’s seat. The TRD models, which include 4-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive, add water-resistant seat fabric, locking rear differential, and multi-terrain select with crawl control. Limited models add leather-trimmed seats (heated and ventilated in front), dual-zone climate control, a 15-speaker JBL sound system with navigation, moonroof, X-REAS automatic-adjust suspension, and 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.
Factory OptionsDepending on trim, extras for the Toyota SUV include a 3rd-row seat, 4-wheel drive (4WD), Entune premium audio with navigation, and the helpful sliding rear cargo deck. TRD Off-Road models can be equipped with the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which can disconnect the stabilizer bars to allow more axle travel to help conquer tough terrain.
Engine & TransmissionThe sole powertrain combination in Toyota’s 4Runner SUV for 2018 is a 270-horsepower V6 mated to a responsive 5-speed automatic transmission. There are three drivetrain choices: 2-wheel drive (2WD) in the SR5 and Limited, part-time 4WD (SR5 and TRD), or full-time 4WD (Limited) with a limited-slip, locking center differential. Towing is a strong point for the 4Runner, with an SAE J2807-compliant rating of 5,000 pounds. A not-so-strong point is fuel economy, with 2WD models returning a combined 19 mpg and 4WD models rated at 18 mpg combined. Thankfully, the Toyota’s V6 drinks regular unleaded.

Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet TraverseThere’s no lack of power in the 2018 Traverse. Its 3.6-liter V6 engine smoothly puts 310 horsepower to the ground through the smooth shifting 9-speed automatic transmission. Unlike many other 8-, 9-, and 10-speed front-wheel-drive transmissions we’ve experienced lately, this one feels just right, downshifting quickly, getting to higher gears swiftly, and providing surprisingly good fuel economy. The turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that’s exclusive to Traverse RS models has less horsepower than the V6, but more torque. That combination, plus its forced induction, equals acceleration and passing power that feel on par with the V6, all while providing the snappy response inherent in a turbo engine. Unlike the V6, though, the 4-cylinder turbocharged Traverse only comes in front-wheel drive. Whether you choose the standard V6 or the intriguing 4-cylinder option, the Traverse’s suspension quells bumps big and small while keeping the SUV from leaning too far in corners. The sharp steering puts its electrical assist on the rack instead of the steering column, resulting in better feel, and the brakes not only provide sure stops but feel good doing it. We’re not trying to oversell it, and the new Traverse isn’t anybody’s first choice for fun on a twisty mountain road, but neither is it intended to be. But on drives long and short, this SUV is surprisingly satisfying.
Interior ComfortThe new Chevy Traverse interior features a big, bright infotainment screen complemented by an available full-color display between the main gauges. The front seats and 2nd-row seats offer up ample headroom and legroom, and the rear bench can accommodate three across without difficulty. The third row is tighter, but still acceptable for kids for long trips, and there’s a ton of cargo space behind the third row even without using the hidden storage area under the floor. Some of the plastics lower on the dash and console feel a little cheap, and we wish there were thicker padding on the door armrest, but that’s about the end of the gripe list.
Exterior StylingThe new Traverse is a sharp looking crossover SUV, looking something like a Chevy Tahoe that cut the carbs and hit the gym. It’s actually longer than the Tahoe, with a longer wheelbase as well. The wide track and body-colored C-pillar give the Traverse an upscale but recognizably Chevy look. If you opt for the High Country you get multi-element LED headlights and more. The RS ups the aggressive factor with an all-black scheme with red backgrounds on all the badges. About the only quibble is the awkward placement of the word “Traverse” on the middle of the front doors.
Favorite FeaturesREARVIEW CAMERA
The rearview camera uses a wide-angle lens to give you a commanding view of the world behind you, projected onto a screen on the rearview mirror. Best of all, if you don’t like it, with a flick of the switch you’re back to reflective glass.
HIDDEN STORAGE
The Traverse offers a cool little hidden storage compartment behind the infotainment screen, with a twist: The screen keeps working even if it’s open, and you can lock the whole thing with a PIN if you like. There’s also a massive hidden compartment under the cargo floor that’s the same size in front- and all-wheel-drive models.
Standard FeaturesAll 2018 Chevy Traverse models come with a 3.6-liter V6 engine and 9-speed automatic (save for the RS model with its turbocharged 4-cylinder). The base L model (front-drive only) comes better equipped than you might expect, with six USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on the 7-inch Chevy MyLink touch screen, a rearview camera, Teen Driver monitoring tech, keyless ignition, and even a traction mode selection. There’s also 3-zone automatic climate control, and seating for eight, including a SmartSlide 2nd-row seat that makes getting to the third row a snap. In addition to multiple airbags, standard safety equipment includes a rear-seat reminder that chimes a warning to make sure you’re not leaving a little one back there.
Factory OptionsChevy Traverse LS, LT, Premier and High Country models can all be ordered with all-wheel drive. Beyond that, LS models get tinted glass and a wider color palette. LT models with a cloth interior add nicer wheels, fog lamps and roof rails. Order an LT model with leather, and you’ll also get a surround-view camera, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alerts, parking assist, and an upgraded infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen. In addition to its small turbocharged engine, RS models add a power tailgate, Bose audio system and navigation. Premier and High Country models include LED headlights, memory seats, hands-free rear tailgate, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and heated and cooled front seats. The High Country also adds a dual-clutch rear differential, adaptive cruise control, and remote start.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard engine and the one that’s suitable for most buyers in the 2018 Traverse SUV is a 3.6-liter V6 with 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. It powers the front or all four wheels through a 9-speed automatic transmission. Developed jointly with Ford, the transmission’s smooth shifts and rapid downshifts embarrass the ZF-built 9-speed automatic used in the Honda Pilot and elsewhere. All-wheel drive in the High Country uses a dual-clutch system for enhanced traction, while the rest of the lineup uses a single-clutch system. The turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Traverse RS makes up for its horsepower deficit to the V6 with more torque. Available only in front-wheel drive, the turbocharged Chevy Traverse provides satisfying and at times even invigorating power delivery. Like the standard model, it uses a 9-speed automatic transmission. Its tow rating is limited to 1,500 pounds versus 5,000 for the V6. Fuel economy for the V6 is pretty solid, topping out at 27 mpg on the highway in front-wheel-drive models. The 4-cylinder Traverse is only rated up to 26 mpg on the highway, but has a slightly better combined fuel economy than the V6 — 22 mpg vs. 21. The caveat is that pricier premium-unleaded fuel is recommended for the turbo-4, while the V6 drinks the regular stuff. According to the EPA, you’ll actually spend more on fuel in a given year for the 4-cylinder Traverse RS than you will for the standard V6. All Traverse models use an engine start/stop that shuts down the engine at idle to save fuel. Unlike others with similar systems, though, this one cannot be disabled.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse is all-new this year, sharing only its name with its predecessor. This midsize SUV boasts a longer wheelbase, more rear-seat room, better cargo space, choice of an updated V6 engine or new turbocharged 4-cylinder, and an excellent 9-speed automatic transmission, plus all the modern technology you could ask for.
The all-new 2018 Chevrolet Traverse manages to improve on the old Traverse’s shortcomings in every way, and yet also manages to upgrade the things we thought were just fine about the old model. The new Traverse is lighter by 350 pounds, offers more power, sharper styling, modern technology, and a top-of-its-class driving experience. That’s saying something because its class includes the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, Volkswagen Atlas, and more midsize 3-row crossover SUV models. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is available, depending on trim level. With seating for up to eight people, tons of cargo space even with the third row up, and better-than-respectable fuel economy, the new Traverse deserves a spot on every family-car shopper’s list.
Used 2018 Chevrolet Traverse PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base, front-wheel-drive-only 2018 Chevrolet Traverse L is just under $30,900 when you include the $945 destination charge. A smarter jumping off point is the better-equipped LS for just under $33,000. LT models with cloth seats start at about $35,500, the LT with leather (and a lot more) start at a bit more than $42,000, the turbo Traverse RS is around $43,000, and the Premier is a pricey-but-competitive $45,400. The High Country adds standard all-wheel drive and more, at a price that’s just under an eye-watering $53,000 — that’s matched only by the similarly lavish Ford Explorer Platinum and GMC Acadia Denali. Otherwise prices are competitive with the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, and the rest of the midsize 3-row SUV market. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note that it’s too early to tell how hard depreciation will hit the Traverse.

A low base price and plenty of features make sealing the deal all the easier.","ConsIf you’re looking for cutting-edge design, advanced driver-assist features, all-wheel drive or a strong resale and reliability history, you’re going to have to shop one of the Grand Caravan’s competitors.",27000,"Driving the Used 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan CargoThere’s nothing thrilling or out of the ordinary about the way the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan drives, unless of course you consider the rapid straight-line acceleration produced by the 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6. Although the Honda Odyssey and Nissan Quest are better drivers, it’s not by much, and the Grand Caravan has a softer ride that actually is quite comfortable. The V6’s ample power is much appreciated both when passing and merging, as well as when pulling a loaded van up steep grades. When properly equipped, the Grand Caravan can tow up to 3,600 pounds. One area the Grand Caravan isn’t so grand is maneuverability. Its massive size and wide turning radius don’t make for graceful parking-lot maneuvers, and unlike its Pacifica sibling, the Grand Caravan lacks the latest infotainment and collision-avoidance systems.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Grand Caravan offers a clever and comfortable interior for its seven passengers. One of its aces is cargo flexibility, primarily due to the Stow ‘n Go 2nd-row seats, which quickly fold into the floor to maximize cargo space without removing the heavy seats. The downside is that this limits the Grand Caravan to only seven passengers, unlike most of its competitors, which can seat up to eight. Those seven have comfortable seats, two available rear video screens and plenty of other amenities. The driver gets a nicely designed instrument panel and plenty of knickknack space.
Exterior StylingIf you think form should follow function, you’re going to love what Dodge has done with the 2018 Grand Caravan. It’s not ugly by any means, but the plain wraps around a very functional and family-friendly vehicle. The two sliding doors are a godsend to anybody who’s ever been trapped in a crowded parking lot, and they’re available with a power sliding mechanism as well. If there’s not enough cargo space behind the third row, the Stow ‘n Place roof-rack system uses swiveling roof-rack crossbars that can be stowed away, out of sight, in the side rails.
Favorite Features3.6-LITER V6 ENGINE If you think a V6 can never match the pulling and passing power of a V8, you need to test drive the 2018 Grand Caravan. The standard Pentastar V6 offers excellent power for passing and merging, yet it manages to return an EPA highway fuel-economy rating of 25 mpg.
 LOW PRICE Slotting in just under $27,000, the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan undercuts the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna by about $3,000, yet still features a number of standard items that are optional or unavailable on the competition.
Standard FeaturesThe base Grand Caravan SE comes pretty well equipped, starting with the 283-horsepower engine, 17-inch wheel covers, remote keyless entry and air conditioning in front and in the rear. It also comes with a tilt/telescope steering wheel, rearview camera, power windows, power locks, steering-wheel-mounted controls for the 6-speaker audio system and cruise control, storage bins hidden in the floor in front of the 2nd-row seats, electronic traction and stability control, and front, front side-impact and full-length side-curtain airbags. The SXT adds a power driver’s seat, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels, power-sliding side doors and liftgate plus the Stow ‘n Place roof rack.
Factory OptionsThe Grand Caravan SE offers a DVD entertainment system and Uconnect hands-free package while the SXT can be equipped with the Driver’s Convenience Group that adds overhead consoles, tri-zone air conditioning, heated steering wheel and heated front seats, 2nd- and 3rd-row side-window sunshades, a garage-door opener, Uconnect voice command, overhead ambient lighting and rear swiveling reading lamps. This same package on the GT trim adds heated 2nd-row seats. All Grand Caravans can be equipped with the Safety Sphere Group that brings rear cross-traffic detection, rear parking sensors and a blind-spot monitor.
Engine & TransmissionOnly one engine is available for the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan: a 3.6-liter V6 engine with 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Known as the Pentastar, it’s an excellent V6 engine, delivering smooth power and pretty good fuel economy. The engine gets paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission that delivers smooth shift action and, unlike some other transmissions in other vehicles, doesn’t have the annoying characteristic of continually ""hunting"" for the correct gear. Finally, the V6 is E85-compatible, so it can operate on blends of gasoline and ethanol.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2018, the Dodge Grand Caravan carries over with no major changes.
It’s no secret that families today are picking midsize-crossover SUVs as their primary mode of transportation, yet the minivan still holds a place for those needing maximum cargo and flexibility. This is why the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan still exists, and although its Town & Country twin has been replaced by the sleek new Pacifica, the Grand Caravan lumbers on offering a powerful standard engine, unique stowable 2nd-row seats and a base price neither the Honda Odyssey nor Toyota Sienna can touch. Of course, stylistically the Grand Caravan has all the appeal of a sardine can on wheels, but you don’t buy a minivan to impress your office mates, you buy it for its cavernous hold, numerous safety features and comfortable ride.

While the “way back” is roomy, it can be difficult getting a trio back there.",39995,"Driving the Used 2018 Buick EnclaveThe all-new Enclave still has the smooth ride of the previous model, but even more so thanks to a 2-inch-longer wheelbase providing a better ride and shorter turning radius. There’s good visibility all around and the V6 now puts out an estimated 310 horsepower, which provides some much needed get-up-and-go. A new 5-link independent rear gives the Enclave sharper response and is tuned to minimize body roll in corners. The electric power steering has an active return assist, which gives the steering a lighter touch when unwinding the wheel. Overall, the handling of the new Enclave is much improved with little or no sacrifice to ride comfort. Available in either front- or all-wheel-drive (FWD, AWD), there’s little to distinguish the two in the driving experience save that the FWD model is quicker off the line thanks to its lighter curb weight. While the Enclave doesn’t deliver the same kind of spirited handling as the Mazda CX-9, it makes up for it in spades by having a much more usable cabin.
Interior ComfortThe interior features a clean, flowing design with a layered look to the dashboard that incorporates a padded surface set off by chrome and wood accents. The large 8-inch screen dominates the center of the dash, and electronic analog gauges are positioned in front of the driver. The comfortable front buckets are divided by a huge center console that has plenty of storage space. Controls are logically arrayed and easy to use in concert with the touch screen. As mentioned, the 2nd-row bench is no more, but there are two comfortable 2nd-row captain’s chairs and the third row has comfortable seating for two, and three in a pinch.
Exterior StylingRiding on a 120.9-inch wheelbase and measuring 204.3 inches in overall length, the 2018 Buick Enclave is a big boy and yet the svelte exterior styling takes a bit off that bulk. Gone is the waterfall grille design, a styling cue that has not aged well for Buick. In its place is a more contemporary opening with wings extending from either side of the rather largish Buick tri-shield logo. Step up to the range-topping Avenir and you’ll get a really slick-looking 3D mesh grille. The roofline is sleeker and the overall look is more like a really tall sports wagon than a boxy SUV. Think Mazda CX-9 on a grand scale.
Favorite FeaturesINTERIOR SPACE With its 2-inch-longer wheelbase and tidier packaging of its new independent rear suspension, the Buick Enclave boasts 10 cubic feet more of interior space. Even with the third row up, it has 23.6 cubic feet of storage space behind. Both the second and third rows fold flat to turn it into cavernous cargo hauler.  QUIET TUNING Quiet Tuning is a Buick hallmark and what distinguished the previous model from the competition. The cabin is downright serene thanks to the attention to detail in controlling noise, vibration and harshness. The laminated glass returns as does the extensive use of sound-deadening material. But also further attention to stiffening the structure through the use of high-strength steel has paid dividends. 
Standard FeaturesBuick’s new Enclave has three trim levels, base, Essence and Premium. All models feature keyless entry and push-button start, hands-free power-programmable rear liftgate, tri-zone automatic climate control, universal home remote, six USB ports, OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Standard safety equipment includes a rearview camera, rear park assist, seven airbags, Teen Driver tracking and rear-seat reminder. Step up to an Avenir and you get 20-inch wheels, leather upholstery, heated/ventilated front seats, heated 2nd-row seats, 360-surround-view camera, a rearview mirror used as a conventional unit or a camera, and a dual moonroof.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is offered as an option on all trim levels except the base model. Options include navigation, upgraded Bose sound system, adaptive cruise control on higher-trim models with full-speed stop-and-go, forward automatic braking, a premium adaptive suspension, heavy-duty cooling, and a sport model.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Buick Enclave has a reworked direct-injection 3.6-liter V6 mated to an all-new 9-speed automatic transmission. Buick estimates EPA fuel economy at 18-mpg city, 26-mpg highway and 21 mpg combined on FWD models, while the AWD versions come in at an estimated 17-mpg city, 25-mpg highway and 20 mpg combined. For comparison, the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 are rated up to 27 mpg for FWD and 26 mpg for AWD. To help bolster fuel economy, the Enclave is equipped with seamless stop/start technology. The powertrain has a base towing capacity of 1,500 pounds, but a new trailer-towing package that includes additional cooling and other tweaks enables the Enclave to have a tow rating of 5,000 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?This is the first major redesign in the vehicle’s history. It rides on an all-new platform, has distinctive and fresh styling and offers a host of new features. The 3.6-liter V6 engine puts out more power and is now mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. And for the first time, Buick is offering a factory-installed towing package that will allow the Enclave to pull up to 5,000 pounds.
It’s been a decade since Buick first introduced the Enclave, a 3-row crossover SUV that arguably has set the standard for the genre. But other than minor facelifts and equipment upgrades, the GM division has done little else to this workhorse. But now, it has totally redesigned the Enclave, added a new range-topping version call Avenir and generally lifted the bar for what buyers can expect in this segment that has some pretty tough competition in the form of the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60 and Mazda CX-9. In fact, with its better packaging and affordable price, it still has enough upscale aura to possibly turn the heads of Audi Q7 and Volvo XC90 intenders.

The smaller Mercedes GLS 550 and AMG GLS 63 offer more horsepower and handling than the Caddy.",74500,"Driving the Used 2018 Cadillac EscaladeIt looks imposing and it intimidates other drivers like Dale Earnhardt, but from behind the wheel the 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a pussy cat. The Caddy is comfortable, easy-to-drive, sure-footed and powerful. Sure it’s big, and parking this beast or backing it up in tight parking garages can be challenging, but on the road it’s like a high-riding luxury sedan with impeccable manners and a refined ride. Cadillac’s 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V8 is a lovable brute. Power for passing and merging is never in short supply and the new 10-speed automatic transmission is responsive and smooth. GM’s Magnetic Ride Control does an admirable job managing the Escalade’s bulk, allowing it to soak up rough roads and negotiate tight turns with little fuss. The power-steering assist is appropriately proportioned. Add the optional 4-wheel drive and the Escalade becomes a winter warrior capable of tackling all kinds of road conditions.
Interior ComfortWith space, space and more space, the new Cadillac Escalade allows families to stretch out and luxuriate in an expanse of leather, wood and high-tech features. All models offer a 2nd-row bench seat allowing seating for eight passengers or a pair of bucket seats and seating for seven. Third-row legroom is tight for tall adults in standard models, but the extended-length 2018 Cadillac ESV SUV rectifies that while also offering considerably more cargo space behind the rearmost seats. Both the 3rd – and 2nd-row seats fold flat, and open up an incredible amount of cargo space, 94.2 cubic feet in the Escalade and over 120 cubic feet in the Escalade ESV.
Exterior StylingYou can’t miss the new Escalade’s massive grille, but you might not see the active-aero shutters behind it, which close to improve aerodynamics on the highway and increase fuel economy. The 2018 Cadillac Escalade also benefits from full-LED headlights with four crystals in the headlights that act as the high beams, giving off radiant light. The long vertical taillights also employ LEDs, making it easier to follow the Escalade when weather conditions are less than ideal, which improves safety. Originally installed for aerodynamic purposes, the rear spoiler not only adds a sporting flair to the SUV’s derriere, it also hides the rear-windshield wiper. At 224.3 inches, the Escalade ESV model is about two-feet longer than the standard model.
Favorite FeaturesAUTOMATIC PARK ASSIST
If you’re worried about parallel parking such a big truck, don’t be. Cadillac’s Automatic Park Assist feature is standard. It uses ultrasonic sensors to locate a suitable parking space and then steers the vehicle into the space while you work the pedals and the gear selection.
MASSAGE FRONT SEATS
Power-adjustable, heated-and-cooled front seats are standard on the new 2018 Cadillac Escalade, while the top Platinum-spec models add the luxury of a massage feature. Kneading, rolling and anti-fatigue settings are offered, and the intensity is adjustable. When used in combination with the heat, it feels reeeeeeeeeally good.
Standard FeaturesStandard luxuries on the new Cadillac Escalade include 12-way power-adjustable seats, 20-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels, Magnetic Ride Control and hands-free power liftgate. A remote starter, tri-zone climate control, and a reconfigurable instrument cluster further the Escalade’s appeal, as do a power-folding 3rd-row seat, heated and cooled front seats, front and rear park assists, rain-sensing wipers, a surround-vision camera, Automatic Park Assist, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible 16-speaker Bose Centerpoint audio, onboard Wi-Fi, CUE with navigation and a power tilt/telescopic steering column with heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. Also standard is Automatic Park Assist, which can practically parallel park the SUV for you, and Surround Vision, which provides a bird’s-eye 360-degree view of the vehicle and its surroundings.
Factory OptionsLane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, adaptive cruise control, side blind-zone alert, rear camera mirror, cross-traffic alert, and 22-inch machine-finished wheels are all available on the 2018 Cadillac Escalade. For buyers seeking the most indulgence, the range-topping Platinum line comes with Nappa semi-aniline leather, suede microfiber headliner and climate-controlled 18-way-adjustable front seats complete with massaging functionality for the driver’s side. A head-up display is also available, as are a sunroof, a rear-entertainment system with a 9-inch overhead screen, wireless headphones and remote control. Top Platinum models get a unique chrome grille, power-retractable side steps, a suede headliner and a leather-wrapped instrument cluster and console.
Engine & TransmissionYou have one choice when it comes to motivating the 2018 Cadillac Escalade luxury SUV, and that’s the 6.2-liter V8 engine rated at 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission for both 2-wheel and 4-wheel-drive (2WD, 4WD) models is a 10-speed automatic with driver shift control and tow/haul mode. Even with the 10-speed transmission, this engine gets parched quickly, and the EPA’s ratings of 14/23 mpg for the 2WD model and 14/21 mpg for the 4WD variant reflect that. While premium gasoline is recommended, the Escalade’s engine doesn’t require it, so you can save a few cents at the pump.

A favorite of moms and moguls, the 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV with big style, big V8 horsepower and seating for eight passengers. Available in two sizes, the full-size Escalade and the even larger Escalade ESV, Cadillac’s largest SUV competes with the Lincoln Navigator, the smaller Mercedes-Benz GLS, Infiniti QX80, Lexus LX and the mechanically similar GMC Yukon and Chevy Tahoe and Suburban. Four trim levels are available, Base, Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum. Behind the Escalade’s distinctive grille is the largest engine in the class, a massive 6.2-liter V8 that makes 420 horsepower. This year it’s mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which improves highway fuel economy. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but 4-wheel drive with a low range is available. Cadillac says the Escalade can tow up to 8,300 pounds and accelerate from 0-60 mph in 6.0 seconds.

One step up is the Premium Plus with a base price around $35,500. It’s a strong value considering the additional equipment. We also recommend the Technology Package if you have the additional $2,600. Those prices are competitive with the base BMW X1, and less than a base Mercedes-Benz GLA250, but thanks to their greater option selections, both rivals can quickly exceed the cost of a loaded Q3. A less prestigious option is the Buick Encore, which costs thousands less at about $25,000. Before buying, check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their Q3. Like the Audi Q5 and Q7 SUVs, the Q3 holds its value very well.
Driving the Used 2018 Audi Q3The balance between comfort and control in the Audi Q3 is commendable. The Audi Q3 feels equally at home cruising down the highway as it does taming a winding canyon road. Its steering is top-notch, its brakes have good feel, and its quiet cabin is easy to see out of, a rare trait these days. This is a good car for a relaxing road trip, but it also likes to dance. Drive it with some angst and the Q3 responds. It’s not a sports car but you can hustle it around. The turbocharged 2.0-liter is smooth enough and puts out 200 horsepower, which is adequate, but it’s still 28 fewer horses than you get in the BMW X1. More power would be nice. Also, the knees of taller drivers may bump the steering column, as it doesn’t adjust quite high enough, forcing them into an awkward driving position.
Interior ComfortAudi’s designers are known for crafting modern interiors with exceptional fit and finish, rich materials and eye-pleasing shapes. The interior of the 2018 Audi Q3 is one of their best. From the driver’s seat this small SUV feels current and upscale. Nothing inside the Q3 seems old-fashioned or dated. Nothing feels cheap or chintzy. Rear legroom is tight, but good enough for adults thanks to the clever sculpting of the front seatbacks. The driver’s seat is comfortable, and the amount of cargo space is surprising, expanding to more than 48 cubic feet when you fold the rear seats.
Exterior StylingAudi has never made an ugly car. Since August Horch founded the brand in 1910, good design has always been part of its strength. Horch left the ugly cars to Audi’s sister brand DKW. Today Audi’s designers continue to innovate and set trends. To lead. One look at the 2018 Audi Q3 and it’s easy to understand. It’s a striking design, with motion in its lines and an air of sophistication in its face. Its proportions mean business. We like the sensual tapered rear end and standard LED taillights. The dual-exhaust outlets are a sporty touch.
Favorite FeaturesQUATTRO ALL-WHEEL DRIVE
Audi pioneered all-wheel drive in luxury-passenger cars way back in the 1980s, and the 2018 Audi Q3 is available with the latest version of its now legendary Quattro all-wheel-drive system. It works seamlessly, maximizing traction in bad weather and improving the vehicle’s handling in all climates and situations.
ONBOARD WI-FI
For those with phone addictions or phone-addicted teenagers, the new Audi Q3 is available with 4G Wi-Fi Hotspot, and up to eight devices can be connected at any one time. This is unique in the segment, although the Mercedes GLC and Infiniti QX30 offer 3G Wi-Fi.
Standard FeaturesThe base Premium model comes with quite a bit of standard equipment, including leather seating, a panoramic sunroof, 130-degree rearview camera, power front seats, heated side mirrors, 60/40-split fold-down rear seat and standard front and rear parking sensors. This adds to the dual-zone climate control, push-button start, and bright xenon headlights. For 2018 the S line exterior including S-line front bumper, doorsills and badging is standard. Audio is provided by a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with HD and satellite radio, Bluetooth streaming and iPod integration that uses a proprietary dongle. Strangely, there’s no standard USB input.
Factory OptionsOptions include Audi’s quattro AWD system, and Audi Connect in-car Wi-Fi and Google Earth-enhanced navigation. This year there’s a new convenience package available on the Premium trim, which includes Audi advanced key (front doors and tailgate), auto-dimming interior mirror with compass and power tailgate. The Sport plus package on the Premium Plus trim includes a more aggressive front bumper, an S-line rear bumper, a 3-spoke flat-bottom multifunction steering wheel with shift paddles, blacked-out exterior trim, black roof rails and unique 19-inch 10-spoke wheels. We also recommend the Technology Package, which adds Audi Connect, Navigation Plus and a color screen.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine available for the 2018 Audi Q3: a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder putting out 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. It’s more than adequate with plenty of bottom-end power and good passing punch on the highway. Some, however, might wish for more. A 6-speed automatic is the sole transmission. The Audi Q3 offers standard front-wheel drive (FWD), but it’s worth it to upgrade to quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) for better handling and better foul-weather capability. Fuel economy lags competitors, with its best of 28-mpg highway, well behind the 32-mpg highway rating of the BMW X1. Adding to that, the Audi Q3 requires premium fuel.

An automatic transmission adds $1,100 to the price of any SportWagen, while AWD adds $2,250 to the S trim level. We think the mid-level SE grade offers the best mix of standard features and price for around $28,000. A loaded SportWagen SEL costs over $31,000 so it isn’t as strong a value. Of course, you want a good deal, so check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see how much people in your area are paying for the new SportWagen. As for resale, the 2018 VW Golf SportWagen looks to be holding only average values, well below those of the Subaru Outback, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.
Driving the Used 2018 Volkswagen Golf SportWagenSharing its suspension and engine with the Volkswagen Golf makes the 2018 VW Golf SportWagen one fun little machine. The 1.8-liter TSI turbocharged 4-cylinder may not look like much on paper, but it delivers its power smoothly throughout the rev band, and is especially willing when power is needed for passing or merging. It’s also smooth and it delivers impressive fuel economy, especially on the highway. Although we love that VW offers a manual transmission, this one is a bit rubbery and vague. The automatic is a much better choice, offering similar fuel economy and still allowing the option of choosing your own gears. We found the SportWagen’s ride to be on the firm side, but its tight suspension allows for some very rapid high-speed maneuvers through twisting turns with very little evidence of torque steer. The available 4Motion AWD is a great feature; unfortunately, it’s available only on the base S trim level.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 VW Golf SportWagen has enough cargo space to rival many small SUVs. Behind its rear seat the cargo space measures 30.4 cubic feet. When more is needed, you can fold its rear seat, which is split 60/40, and increase the cargo capacity to 66.5 cubic feet. Up front the 2018 Golf SportWagen gets high marks for its interior. Materials used and fit and finish all look like they’re from a higher class of car. Comfortable seating includes the rear seats, which offer decent legroom and headroom, even for taller passengers. The cloth seats on the base S trim are stylish and handsome.
Exterior StylingIt looks quite a bit longer than the Golf hatchback, because it is. The 2018 VW Golf SportWagen is about a foot longer than the hatchback. For 2018 VW has upgraded the look of the SportWagen with new front-end styling, including new LED daytime-running lights, and LED taillights. It’s a cleaner look and it gives the little wagon a more modern appearance. Wagons aren’t as common as they used to be, and the SportWagen’s long roof and upright hatch give it a distinctive European flavor. It looks sporty, especially with the larger wheels and tires of the SE trim level.
Favorite Features4MOTION ALL-WHEEL DRIVE Despite its popularity, Volkswagen is one of the few automakers to offer all-wheel drive in the compact class. VW’s excellent 4Motion all-wheel-drive system is available on the Golf SportWagen for around $2,250. The system increases the wagon’s traction on all road surfaces including the snowy and slushy messes of winter.
 DRIVER-ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS For 2018 the new VW Golf SportWagen with the SE trim level comes standard with Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking, as well as Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert.

The standard audio system includes a 6.5-inch touch screen, eight speakers, Bluetooth, a CD player, SiriusXM satellite radio, and Volkswagen’s Media Device Interface to connect your smartphone via Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or MirrorLink. SE models get standard 16-inch wheels, an 8-inch touch screen as well as Forward Collision Warning, Autonomous Emergency Braking and Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert.
Factory OptionsOptions are mostly divided among trim levels. Higher-level Golf SportWagen models (SE and SEL) get a standard automatic transmission. SE equipment also includes 16-inch wheels, heated front seats, Leatherette upholstery, keyless entry and ignition, corner-illuminating fog lights, panoramic sunroof and a rockin’ Fender audio system. The top SEL model adds 17-inch wheels, 12-way-power adjustment for the driver’s seat, automatic climate control, navigation and Adaptive Cruise control.

Driving the Used 2018 Nissan MuranoFirst, you’ll appreciate the Murano’s smooth ride. This SUV feels solid and its suspension soaks up rough roads without knocking you around or spilling your half-caf non-fat mochachino. Then the Nissan’s precise steering, and the satisfying pull and off-the-line power of its big V6 engine will reveal themselves. The 3.5-liter V6 pumps out a healthy 260 horsepower and it works well the SUV’s Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission with D-Step Logic, a technology that mimics the shift points of a traditional stepped automatic while delivering the efficiency only a CVT can attain. Around town the Murano is athletic and maneuverable, with stable handling, but it’s also a great road-tripper with a quiet interior and wonderfully shaped seats, which feel good even after an 800-mile run through three states. While the Murano is not set up for off-road adventuring, its AWD system and nearly seven inches of ground clearance make it ideal for tackling deep snow.
Interior ComfortThe men and women who created the new Nissan Murano’s cabin are a bunch of talented individuals, as it’s one of the best interiors in a very crowded class. Fit/finish is excellent and the materials are rich and upscale. The seats are large and perfectly shaped and supportive. Choose the optional and expansive panoramic sunroof, and the interior is washed in natural light as if it were a back-porch sunroom. Behind the rear seat is over 30 cubic feet of space, and flipping the rear seat flat offers over 65 cubic feet, which is less than you get in the Ford Edge.
Exterior StylingYou won’t miss the 2018 Nissan Murano in the strip-mall parking lot. Up top is a “floating roof,” leading the way is the “V-Motion” front end, at both front and rear are “boomerang” lights that wrap into the fenders, along the sides are curves so pronounced they presented engineering challenges in forming the stamping tools that make them. Aerodynamic details include a lower shutter grille, front and rear spoilers, rear-tire air deflectors, rear-suspension fairings and even a fuel-tank shape optimized for efficient airflow. There isn’t one square inch that isn’t artfully folded and molded.
Favorite FeaturesAUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING This important safety system is now standard on every new Nissan Murano. It monitors the road ahead for vehicles or objects blocking your path. If a potential collision is detected, it will alert the driver with audible and visual warnings. If the driver fails to respond, the system can apply the brakes to reduce the speed of impact or hopefully avoid the collision.
 AROUND VIEW MONITOR Nissan’s 360-degree Around View Monitor is nothing short of ingenious. It’s like a rearview camera on growth hormone. It uses cameras mounted around the vehicle to give you a bird’s-eye view of the SUV and its surroundings, helping you negotiate tight places, parallel park and avoid backing over or into objects.
Standard FeaturesStandard equipment for the new 2018 Murano base S trim level includes Advanced Drive-Assist Display with a 7-inch screen, navigation, an 8-inch touch screen, Automatic Emergency Braking, Bluetooth, RearView Monitor, Nissan Intelligent Key with push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, tilt/telescoping steering column, three 12-volt outlets, cloth seating surfaces and reclining rear seatbacks with center armrest. The AM/FM/CD audio has MP3/WMZ CD capability and six speakers, and there are SiriusXM Satellite Radio, speed-sensitive volume control, steering-wheel audio and cruise controls. Also standard is Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) with Traction Control System (TCS), plus 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, a full complement of occupant-protection features and NissanConnect with Mobile Apps.
Factory OptionsWe think the mid-trim Premium Plus A5 is worth the extra $3,000 as it adds safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic, and will even alert you of a coming vehicle when exiting the vehicle. Also included are full LED headlights, heated front seats and hands-free trunk/tailgate release. Prestige trims add the Virtual Cockpit, 8.3-inch display with navigation, and a superb 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen system. Other options include a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, head-up display and Driver Assistance package with adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and traffic-sign recognition. Audi Connect Prime grants 4G LTE connectivity.
Engine & TransmissionA 3.5-liter V6 with 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque powers the 2018 Nissan Murano. The transmission is Nissan’s Xtronic continuously variable automatic, with D-Step Logic. The result is a smoothness common to CVTs, but with the feel of a traditional stepped automatic. In operation, the 2018 Murano is smooth, quiet and silky and has plenty of ready response and power for any reasonable driving situation. The Murano is also available with either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) for those who must occasionally deal with bad weather and slick roads. Fuel consumption is remarkably thrifty, with both the FWD and AWD Murano models EPA-rated at 21-mpg city and 28-mpg highway. 3.5-liter V6 260 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 240 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/28 mpg

The Murano SL gets standard Intelligent Cruise Control, a Motion-Activated Power Liftgate and heated rear seats and steering wheel. There’s also more center-console storage and Platinum models get a standard Dual Panel Moonroof.
Roomy, comfortable and refined, the 2018 Nissan Murano fits in the center of Nissan’s extensive lineup of SUVs. Larger than the Rogue, but smaller than the Pathfinder, the new Nissan Murano is a 5-passenger midsize SUV with daring design, a luxurious interior and a powerful V6. A Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Murano competes with the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport as well as many 3-row SUVs like the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9. Nissan offers the Murano in four trim levels, S, SV, SL and Platinum. Each is powered by a Nissan’s tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6, which makes 260 horsepower, and a continuously variable automatic transmission.

ConsThe new Nissan Sentra is available only as a 4-door sedan. If you’re looking for a hatchback, check out the Honda Civic, VW Golf, Mazda3 or Chevy Cruze. Enthusiast drivers should also look at the better-performing VW Golf GTI and Golf R, the Honda Civic Si and Type R and the Ford Focus ST and RS.",17000,"Used 2018 Nissan Sentra PricingThe 2018 Nissan Sentra S with a manual transmission comes with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $18,000, including the $885 destination charge. On the other side of the pricing spectrum, the Sentra SL starts around $24,500, which is a pretty solid bargain for a car with adaptive cruise, blind-spot detection and forward-emergency braking. The SR Turbo starts around $23,000. Prices are on the lower side for the segment, undercutting cars like the Honda Civic and Ford Focus, but coming in a bit higher than the Kia Forte. An SR Turbo starts around $23,000 and the Nismo model is over $26,000. As a long-term prospect, the 2018 Sentra’s resale value is about average for the compact-sedan class, but its solidity and refinement make it feel like it’s worth more. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Sentra.
Driving the Used 2018 Nissan SentraThe Sentra’s ride is comfortable and visibility is excellent. The interior is also pleasingly spacious and comfortable. It’s a pleasant sedan in the city, but it’s not a car you would hesitate to road-trip through a few states either. Its interior is quiet on the highway, and its highway fuel economy is impressive. It’s easy to average over 35 mpg. Power is sufficient, but a drive in the mountains with a few on board will make you wish for more. With 188 horsepower speed comes easier for the Sentra SR Turbo and Sentra Nismo. These turbocharged models are quick and much more fun to drive. However, even in Nismo trim the Sentra’s handling is not the best in this class. The Sentra still uses an antiquated rear-suspension design that keeps it from turning corners as well as the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Ford Focus, which are more athletic. The Sentra’s steering does feel good, however, and its brakes provide plenty of strong stopping power.
Interior ComfortInside, the 2018 Sentra offers one of the largest interiors in its class. In fact, according to the EPA’s classification system, there’s so much room inside the Sentra it’s actually a midsize. There’s room for five, ample rear-seat legroom and large trunk capacity of 15.1 cubic feet. A 60/40-split fold-down rear seat is standard. The front seats are comfortable, and the interior layout is simple and intuitive. High-quality materials include soft-touch door armrests, which improve comfort on long drives. Our test car’s piano-black accents were a nice touch and the 5-inch color LED info screen between the main gauges was useful.
Exterior StylingUnlike its little brother, the frumpy Nissan Versa sedan, the 2018 Sentra is well proportioned and attractive. Its design closely mimics the shape of Nissan’s larger Altima sedan with athletic curves and a subtle flare of its wheel wells. Although it’s more conservative than some other designs in the class, the Sentra’s sculpted flanks and dramatic headlights and grille treatment keep it from being boring, while the touches of bright trim around the greenhouse, grille and door handles give it an upscale presence. SL and SR trim levels feature LED low-beam headlights as well. Nissan’s wheel designs are also attractive and the Sentra Nismo gets dark chrome, unique side sills, aggressive front and rear bumper covers and a red stripe.
Favorite FeaturesACTIVE UNDERSTEER CONTROL This system is standard on all Sentras except the base Sentra S with the manual transmission. It’s also used on the Nissan Altima. It improves both the performance and overall safety of the vehicle by lightly braking the inside front wheels during cornering, which enhances traction and the sedan’s ability to turn. Its operation is completely undetectable by the driver.
 SAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGIES The 2018 Sentra is one of Nissan’s most affordable sedans, but it still offers an impressive list of active safety systems. Automatic Emergency Braking is now standard on all automatic-transmission-equipped models except the Sentra Nismo. Intelligent Cruise Control, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert are also available. 
Standard FeaturesThe most basic 2018 Nissan Sentra is the S, and it comes with a 6-speed manual, three driving modes — Eco, Normal and Sport — and standard air conditioning. It’s also equipped with Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a USB port, keyless entry and truck release, electroluminescent gauges, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, auto headlights, and an audio system with four speakers. For extra cargo space, the rear seatbacks fold in a 60/40 split. Starting this year all new Sentras with the automatic transmission get Automatic Emergency Braking, and the automatic is standard on SV, SR and SL models.
Factory OptionsThe 2018 Sentra SL is the top dog, but the Sentra SR also comes with the LED low-beam headlights, larger 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless ignition, and it can be equipped with the same upgraded audio system that includes a 5.8-inch screen and navigation. SR and SL models also get heated outside mirrors, and the SL gets a moonroof and leather upholstery. Other available luxuries include Nissan Voice Recognition for audio and navigation and a long list of safety systems including Intelligent Cruise Control, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The Sentra Nismo gets sports seats, red interior accents and a racy suede-and-leather-covered steering wheel.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2018 Nissan’s Sentra comes with two engine choices. S, SV, SR and SL use a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder that, with only 130 horsepower (124 horsepower with the automatic transmission), is among the least powerful in the class. The SR Turbo gets a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine that bumps output to a more respectable 188 horsepower. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) works its magic to get the Sentra up to speed with little fuss, and passing power is fine as long as you plan a heartbeat ahead. There is a 6-speed manual transmission available, but only on the base model, the SR Turbo and the Sentra Nismo, and it actually hurts fuel economy, rather than helping it. 1.8-liter inline-4 (6-speed manual) 130 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm (124 horsepower w/CA emissions) 128 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm (125 lb-ft w/CA emissions) EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/35 mpg
 1.8-liter inline-4 (CVT automatic) 124 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm  125 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 29/37 mpg
 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 188 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm 177 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-5,200 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/32 mpg (manual), 27/33 mpg (automatic)

If you’re looking for the sure-footedness of Subaru’s all-wheel-drive in a rugged and roomy SUV that won’t break the bank, consider the advantages of buying a used 2018 Subaru Forester.
Nobody’s fool, the previous generation Forester isn’t quite as advanced as 2019 and newer design, but it still has many of the must-have features, including available EyeSight driver assist. And although Subaru did not offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto this year, a turbocharged engine on the XT trims was available.
You can start your search on KBB.com’s Cars for Sale page that lists both private party and dealer ads. Once you find your Forester, you’ll have a few options for buying.
A private party sale will save you the most money, but at three years old, a 2018 Forester won’t have much time left on its factory warranties. If this is something that concerns you, consider the advantage of buying a Certified Pre-Owned Forester.
A CPO Forester is sold through the Subaru dealer network and includes an extended powertrain warranty out to 7 years or 100,000 miles. It comes with a 152-point inspection and offers perks like a 3-month trial subscription to SiriusXM radio.

Driving the Used 2018 Subaru ForesterSubaru’s 2018 Forester is the rare crossover SUV that’s equally adept on-road and off-road. The AWD system makes the most of the engine’s oomph to deliver smooth, even power regardless of road conditions. In most models that power is delivered through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that helps keep fuel economy near the top of the class. Our one gripe is throttle tip-in — initial accelerator response can be touchy, causing the Forester to feel like it’s lurching. After a while you should get used to it, or you can opt for the 6-speed manual transmission. The Forester’s suspension blends comfort and control without sacrificing either, with minimal body roll in corners but enough travel to absorb ruts when the asphalt ends. The electrically assisted power steering feels precise, and if you want extra power, the XT turbo models are downright quick, getting to 60 mph in about six seconds.
Interior ComfortWith the addition of thicker glass, an acoustic windshield, new door seals and additional sound deadening under the floor last year, the latest Subaru Forester promises to be notably quieter than its predecessor. Soft-touch surfaces already helped make the Forester feel upscale, and the newly upgraded interior on the Forester Touring models ups that ante. The 2-row/5-passenger interior design is excellent thanks to its generous visibility and sensible design. The doors open wide, there’s good rear-seat legroom, and there’s a ton of cargo space: over 30 cubic feet behind the rear seats, and around 70 cubic feet with the seats folded.
Exterior StylingWith an exterior that also was updated last year, the 2018 Forester’s sleek headlights incorporate Subaru’s C-shaped LED motif and a fresh-looking hexagonal grille. The headlights also received a functional upgrade with an available steering-responsive feature that turns them with the steering wheel to give better views at night. The Forester rides 8.7 inches off the ground, ground clearance that makes it especially competent in snowy climates. Turbocharged XT models have a unique front end and a rear roof spoiler, while the new Black Edition — actually available in four exterior colors — has darkened alloy wheels and other exterior treatments.
Favorite FeaturesX-MODE WITH HILL DESCENT CONTROL
X-Mode, standard starting on the Premium trim with the CVT transmission, burnishes the Forester’s off-road reputation. Press the corresponding button, and this Subie will optimize control of the throttle, AWD system, stability and traction control, and Hill Descent Control to maximize the Forester for tackling slippery surfaces and steep inclines.
EYESIGHT DRIVER-ASSIST SYSTEM
The 2018 Forester’s available EyeSight system uses two color cameras to view the road ahead, allowing advanced safety features such as pre-collision braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and more.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Forester is available in six trims, including the top two 2.0XT turbocharged models. At its most basic, a 2.5i includes AWD, the Subaru Starlink infotainment system with 6.2-inch display and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD system with HD Radio, Bluetooth connectivity and USB and auxiliary inputs. We recommend stepping up at least one trim to the 2.5i Premium, which adds a panoramic sunroof, 10-way-power driver’s seat, reclining rear seatbacks and fold-down rear armrest with cup holders, upgraded infotainment system, alloy wheels, automatic climate control, roof rails and body-color side mirrors. That trim also opens a door to convenient options like a power tailgate.
Factory OptionsForester 2.5i Limited models bring leather seating and standard CVT automatic transmission, and add features that are optional on the Premium model such as blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, power tailgate and fog lights. Continuing the climb, Touring models bring 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control, heated steering wheel, one-touch folding rear seats and LED headlights. Other options include navigation, harman/kardon premium audio system, and the EyeSight suite of driver-assist and active safety features. If you must have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, you’ll have to look elsewhere as it isn’t available on the 2018 Forester.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines remain available in the 2018 Forester, both of which are 4-cylinder “boxer” — or flat — engines. This setup allows the engine to be placed lower in the vehicle, which in turn creates a lower center of gravity and enhanced stability. Most Foresters are equipped with a non-turbo 2.5-liter that makes 170 horsepower, backed by either a 6-speed manual transmission or the Lineartronic CVT automatic. Forester 2.0XT SUVs offer more power thanks to a turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter engine. This smaller engine develops 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, routing it to all four wheels through a High-Torque Lineartronic CVT with multi-mode SI-Drive that can emulate six or eight virtual gear ratios. Neither model is particularly well-suited for towing, rated at only 1,500 pounds.

The 2018 Subaru Forester is one of over a dozen compact-crossover SUVs vying for your attention, but it’s the only one with standard all-wheel drive. That trait has long made Subarus the favored vehicles of cold-weather states, while the Forester’s ample ground clearance and ability to venture off-pavement have made it popular with the adventure-minded. Those abilities set it apart from rivals like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, but they’re not the only compelling reasons for the Forester. It can be outfitted with a robust suite of safety and driving aids, a turbocharged engine and, on lower models, it’s among the last of its kind to offer a manual transmission. With its remarkable resale value, the Forester further stands out from the pack.

The standard Elantra’s new 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine feels peppier than its 147 horsepower indicates, and its available 6-speed automatic transmission with Drive Mode Select is a willing partner. Whether romping around mountain 2-lanes enjoying the Sport mode’s responsive steering and sportier shift patterns, or darting through city avenues where Normal mode provides smooth shifts and throttle response, we were impressed with Elantra. For Green Party members, the Elantra Eco’s gas-sipping 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder achieves a combined city/highway EPA figure of 35 mpg. And for party animals, the Elantra Sport rocks a 1.6-liter turbo delivering 201 horsepower and mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the Elantra sedan and GT hatchback continue to use a torsion beam rear suspension the Elantra Sport and GT Sport models raise the sport coefficient thanks in part to a multi-link rear suspension.
Interior ComfortHyundai is proud to point out that the Elantra’s interior is a size higher than its class. So while this is a compact car, its 110.2 cubic feet of interior room qualifies it as a midsize vehicle, according to the EPA. It may not be quite as roomy as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, but it’s still a testament to modern engineering that no longer means a small car has to be a ""penalty box."" We especially appreciate the driver-centric dash layout, and the fact that controls for audio, climate and the like are actually buttons and knobs vs. multi-step touch-based systems.
Exterior StylingHyundai’s emphasis on design is just as important as its fantastic warranty. The Elantra looks more sophisticated than its price tag suggests. It’s not gaudy, either, though we admit the large hexagonal grille is borderline gaping. The Elantra further stands out with an athletic stance, front-wheel air curtains, and an integrated rear spoiler built into the trunk lid. The Elantra feels larger from the passenger compartment, yet is easy to navigate in tight spaces at just 179.9 inches long and 70.9 inches wide.
Favorite FeaturesPOWER TRUNK, WITH A TRICK The 2018 Elantra offers a power-operated trunk, a feature made even more convenient thanks to its hands-free operation. With the key fob in your pocket or purse, all you have to do is walk behind the car, wait a few seconds, and the trunk will open.
 DUAL-CLUTCH TRANSMISSION With the Elantra Sport and GT Sport offering a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, it injects a whole new driving dynamic to the Elantra lineup. And on the gas-saving side of the ledger, the Elantra Eco model uses that dual-clutch transmission for improved fuel economy.
Standard FeaturesEven the most basic 2018 Elantra includes air conditioning, power windows and door locks, a 6-way driver’s seat with height adjustment, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and AM/FM/CD audio with USB and auxiliary jacks. For 2018, the Elantra SE with the Popular Equipment package is replaced by the SEL model, which includes a 7-inch touch-screen display, backup camera, Bluetooth, cruise control, hood insulation for a quieter ride, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. All new Elantras come with a generous 10-year/100,000-mile warranty for the powertrain and five years of roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsAside from the automatic transmission ($1,000), most major options for the 2018 Elantra are bundled into packages. When you select the high-line Limited trim, your Elantra includes a leather interior, power driver’s seat with lumbar support, hands-free power trunk, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, and push-button start. Adding the Tech package to that trim includes navigation with an 8-inch screen, Infinity audio, heated rear seats, and a power sunroof. The 2018 Elantra Value Edition adds plenty of up-level features for about 21 grand. The list includes hands-free trunk release, heated front seats, outside door handle approach lights, and dual-zone automatic temperature control. Go for the Ultimate package, and you’ll get automatic emergency braking, smart cruise control, lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, the driver’s seat memory system and high-intensity headlights that turn in the direction of the steering.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Elantra offers a choice of 4-cylinder engines. The standard powerplant is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. In the Elantra SE and Elantra GT, that engine is mated to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the SEL, Limited and Value Edition models all come exclusively with the automatic. The 2018 Elantra Sport and Elantra GT Sport are equipped with a more powerful 1.6-liter turbo engine and the choice of a standard 6-speed manual or optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The frugal might look toward the Eco model offering a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and achieves an estimated 40 mpg. 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 (2018 Elantra Eco) 128 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm 156 lb-ft of torque @ 1,400-3,700 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 32/40 mpg

The SEL Elantra receives popular equipment which includes Blind Spot Detection with Rear Cross-traffic Alert and Lane Change Assist, a 7-inch in-dash display, and heated outside mirrors. The Eco model concentrates on value and efficiency, while the Sport and GT hatchback models aim at active and enthusiast drivers.
Hyundai’s 6th-generation Elantra compact sedan and hatchback add more available safety and technology features for 2018, continuing its move to conquest best-selling rivals like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra. The Elantra boasts stylish looks, premium amenities and a class-leading warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. The standard 2018 Hyundai Elantra continues with a blend of refinement, eager driving manners, and efficiency. The Eco sedan achieves noticeable fuel economy of EPA ratings of 35 mpg combined, outfitted with a compact 1.4-liter turbocharged engine. At the other end of the spectrum, the Elantra Sport model, outfitted with a 201 horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder, puts a bit more zip into driving, as does the new Elantra GT which adds the driving dynamics and features of a compact hatchback.

Best Deals on a 2018 Honda Civic for April
A used 2018 Honda Civic makes a great used car choice. It’s fuel-efficient, roomy, comfortable, safe, and reliable. The sporty good looks, selection of trims and body styles, and advanced safety technology only serve to make a good deal even better.
As many leased 2018 Civics will be coming back to dealers, you should have a selection of low-mileage, well-maintained cars from which to choose, although we suspect a lot of them will be the base LX trim.
Regardless of which model you discover, finding one with the Certified Pre-Owned label is your best bet. A CPO Civic gets a thorough inspection, comes with additional time and mileage added to its factory warranties, and can be bought or leased.
A CPO Civic will cost more than a Civic bought directly from its previous owner. However, once you consider the added benefits over the car loan’s life, a CPO Civic begins to look like a winner.
Before you get ready to make an offer, we suggest a visit to KBB.com’s My Car’s Value  page, where you can plug in the details of your specific car and come up with a price range fair to both buyer and seller.
The best deals in brief
Honda’s Certified Pre-Owned program adds value to your used car purchase by extending its limited and powertrain warranties, as well as adding a few extra perks.

Driving the Used 2018 Honda CivicHonda says its vast and longtime involvement in auto racing improves its street cars. Although it’s hard to draw a direct line from the Honda that won the 2017 Indy 500 to the new Civic, although both cars are turbocharged, a big part of the Civic’s winning formula is the way it combines practicality, efficiency and everyday comfort with modest to maximum dashes of sportiness. The Civic is highly satisfying to drive, even a base model with the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed manual transmission. The smaller but more powerful turbocharged 1.5-liter offers good if not blistering acceleration and nary a hint of turbo lag. Most buyers will choose the automatic transmission, and the Civic’s CVT (continuously variable transmission) is among the best at mimicking a traditional one. A standard Civic can’t quite match a Mazda3 in cornering dynamics, but it’s still among the best in its class, as is its steering feel.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Civic’s interior is full of premium materials and top-notch plastics. Ergonomics is a volume knob shy of perfection, as using the new Honda Civic’s touch screen to crank up the Taylor Swift can be frustrating and distracting. This is a problem Honda has already addressed in other models. The large, easy-to-read screen also serves as the control center for audio, Apple CarPlay and the optional navigation system. The Civic boasts some of the best interior volume among compact cars. Rear-seat legroom is impressive in the sedan, but beware of the wide sills when entering and exiting. At 15.1 cubic feet, the Civic sedan’s trunk is huge. Hatchback Civics boast 25.7 cubic feet of space with the rear seats up and some 20 additional cubic feet with them down.
Exterior StylingHonda took chances with the design of the 2018 Honda Civic and they have paid off. The Civic’s shape is daring and innovative, with an aggressive front end, a long, low and wide stance and unique C-shaped taillights. The Civic Sedan and Coupe feature elegant sloping rooflines, while the Civic hatchback stands out with its bulbous rear end, high-mounted spoiler and the gaping fake vents on either side of its rear bumper. Sport and Sport Touring hatchbacks can be spied via their center-mounted dual-exhaust outlets, while the new Si boasts its own edgier exterior cosmetics. The Type R gets a hood scoop, three exhaust pipes and a gargantuan rear spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesHONDA SENSING
This comprehensive suite of optional safety features and driving aids costs only $1,000. It’s an incredible value. The package includes adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, road-departure mitigation, forward-collision warning, lane-keeping assist and the Collision Mitigation Braking System, which can automatically apply the brakes if a frontal collision appears imminent.
HONDA LANEWATCH
Standard on EX, EX-L and the top Sport Touring trim levels, this clever system adds a camera to the passenger-side mirror to eliminate your blind spot. Every time you turn on the Civic’s right turn signal, the camera provides a live shot of the Civic’s flank on the interior touch screen.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Honda Civic is offered in an array of trims that range from base LX to top Touring variants as well as the enthusiast-oriented Si and Type R halo models. The least expensive Civic LX sedan includes automatic climate control, rearview camera, folding rear seat, and a 4-speaker AM/FM audio system with USB port, Bluetooth connectivity and 5-inch screen. We think most buyers will prefer stepping up to at least an EX model, which includes an automatic transmission (optional on LX models), remote engine start, moonroof, 60/40-split folding rear seat and upgraded infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen that is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.
Factory OptionsClimbing to the Civic EX-T in the sedan or coupe, or any Civic hatchback, brings the smaller but more powerful turbocharged engine as standard. Other features vary with trim level, including leather interior, heated front and rear seats, navigation system, Honda’s LaneWatch camera-based blind-spot monitoring system, power driver’s seat, and dual-zone automatic climate control. One package we recommend for any Civic (as long as it has the required automatic transmission) is the Honda Sensing system. This suite of active safety features and driving aids described in “Favorite Things” is well worth the extra $1,000.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines and two transmissions are used in the high-volume members of the 2018 Honda Civic. Base sedans and coupes use a 158-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder available with a 6-speed manual transmission or an excellent continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims and all 2018 Civic hatchbacks employ a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that is more powerful and efficient. This engine can also be connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. Sport and Sport Touring Hatchbacks get a power bump. The Civic Si pairs its 205-horsepower/1.5-liter turbo engine with a 6-speed manual as does the Type R with its 306-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. All 2018 Civics remain front-wheel drive, but while the baseline models burn regular unleaded gasoline, the Si and Type R require premium to exploit their full performance potential.

A perennial best-seller, the roomy and fuel-efficient 2018 Honda Civic has become the benchmark for the compact class, which includes the Toyota Corolla, Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, VW Golf and Jetta, Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. The new Civic is offered as a sedan, coupe or hatchback, and its available turbocharged engines produce as much as 306 horsepower.

It offers lots of features, handsome styling and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty for added peace of mind.","ConsA small dealer network and poor resale values have the 2018 Outlander Sport taking a back seat to the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. The Subaru Crosstrek and Jeep Renegade offer better off-road ability, and all the above-mentioned vehicles offer more advanced driver-assist systems, some as standard equipment.",21250,"Driving the Used 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander SportThe 2018 Outlander Sport may have a new face and features, but deep down it is still the same vehicle that debuted back in 2011. That’s a problem as most of its primary competitors now run on much more modern platforms with more advanced features. That said, the public seems to be okay with “old” because the Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi’s best-selling model. The reason has to do with packaging. In the Outlander Sport, you’ll get a stylish, comfortable compact SUV offering a wide range of trims, engines and options. There’s even a 5-speed manual transmission on the base front-wheel-drive model. And while its driving characteristics and fuel economy fall short of the Mazda CX-5 and Kia Sportage, the Outlander Sport is a very stable vehicle made even better by Mitsubishi’s advanced all-wheel-drive system. We think the best powertrain is the 168-horsepower, 2.4-liter engine offered on the SE and SEL trims.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Outlander Sport gets a new center-console design with more padding to protect your knees. A new 7-inch touch screen graces ES trims, while SE and SEL models get a 7-inch smartphone-link display. The light-gray interior color option helps brighten up what can usually be a somber black interior at this price. Comfortable front seats are supportive over a long drive, but the rear seats will make 6-footers feel cramped. Behind the second row is a pretty small cargo area, offering just 20 cubic feet of space, although it opens up considerably when you fold down the rear seatbacks.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Outlander Sport gets a revised front and rear bumper design with new LED running lights and new accent pieces. It’s an aggressive design that looks good here. The rest of the vehicle has remained largely unchanged over the years, with the exception of molding around the wheelwells. The proportions are spot-on, and the compact size — it’s about eight inches shorter than a CR-V — makes it easy to maneuver around tight urban parking lots. An optionally available roof rack can carry larger items that won’t fit inside.
Favorite FeaturesROCKFORD FOSGATE AUDIO SYSTEM Available on the SEL grade, the optional 710-watt, 9-speaker Rockford Fosgate audio system is a music lover’s dream come true. A separate subwoofer provides plenty of bass, and the system can be teamed with a 40-gigabyte hard drive for added music storage.
 GREAT WARRANTY Like Kia and Hyundai, Mitsubishi offers a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty on every Outlander Sport, meaning you will have your car paid off or maybe even traded in before the warranty expires. 
Standard FeaturesThe base Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES offers some solid features for its roughly $21,250 price, including leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, LED taillights, automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, steering-wheel-mounted cruise control and audio buttons, a 4-speaker/140-watt AM/FM/CD system with 7-inch touch screen and rearview camera. A multicolor information display reads out fuel consumption, outside temperature and other data. Safety systems include hill-start assist, stability control and seven standard airbags, plus a driver’s-side knee airbag. Mitsubishi vehicles also come with a new-car warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain.
Factory OptionsSkip the base 2.0-liter engine and get the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, which offers more power and torque with only a minor penalty in fuel economy. Otherwise, features get added as you work up the trim ladder. The SE model adds fog lights, push-button ignition, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the SEL takes that and adds leather seating, HID headlights and power-folding side-view mirrors. The SEL Touring package adds a panoramic glass roof, Rockford Fosgate audio system, lane-departure warning, forward-collision mitigation and auto high beams. All-wheel drive is available on all models. 
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2018 Outlander Sport is a forgettable 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with only 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. It comes with a 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission, but it’s overwhelmed by this little SUV, which comes in front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). Instead, get the available 2.4-liter 4-cylinder. At 168 horsepower it’s no powerhouse, but it doesn’t have to work as hard to get the Outlander Sport moving, so it’s quieter as well as offering more punch. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is the only option, but it mimics a standard transmission with ""shift"" points, and it was smooth enough. An AWD system is available on all models, offering peace of mind for slippery-road conditions.

The SEL offers a new Touring Package with forward-collision warning and lane-departure warning. A mild rework of the front and rear bumpers rounds out the changes of note.
While Mitsubishi’s 2018 Outlander Sport compact-crossover SUV might not be as popular as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Crosstrek, it does represent a very good value. Affordable, nicely equipped and solidly constructed, the 2018 Outlander Sport gives buyers a shot at driving something a bit less commonplace without risking worry about long-term reliability. Upper-level trims offer such amenities as a Rockford Fosgate audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s also Mitsubishi’s advanced all-wheel-drive system, dubbed All-Wheel Control (AWC), that offers an added measure of security in snowy climates. However, where many competitors offer such driver assists as collision mitigation, lane-departure warning and high-beam assist as standard equipment, Mitsubishi only offers them as options on the most expensive trim.

A robust V8 and 8,300-pound max tow rating also come in handy.","ConsYou can tow up to 9,300-pounds with a Ford Expedition Max, plus you’ll get a better ride and flat loading floor as well. If you just need a roomy 3-row SUV without the added bulk, check out the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot or the 2019 Subaru Ascent.",51400,"Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet SuburbanGM has put everything it knows about suspension and steering systems into the 2018 Chevrolet Suburban, and in doing so has created a massive SUV that rides and handles with remarkable ease. This nearly 3-ton body-on-frame family hauler rides more like a large luxury sedan than a truck-based SUV. Agile in tight confines and stable at high speeds, the Suburban is able to round corners without instilling a sense of top heaviness one might expect of such a tall vehicle. Premier models further improve the ride with a set of magnetically adjustable shocks that adjust to road conditions in just milliseconds. The Suburban’s 5.3-liter V8 generates 355 horsepower, not the best in class but more than enough to move this mammoth Chevy with vigor, even when fully loaded. Equally impressive is the 23-mpg highway fuel-economy figure, a number thought impossible for a vehicle of this size a mere decade ago.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Suburban’s upscale interior grabs your attention from the moment you step inside; its artful shapes, high-end materials and excellent fit-and-finish seem more appropriate for a luxury sedan than a full-size SUV. The 2nd-row’s comfy seats recline but, unfortunately, don’t slide fore and aft. The third row has enough foot- and legroom for adults, at least for shorter trips, and kids will be fine. A high cargo floor provides space for the flat-fold 3rd-row seats, but that space is not wasted — under the floor is a handy hidden storage area.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Chevy Suburban’s exterior shares nothing of design or components with its Silverado pickup-truck counterpart. Chevy’s exterior designers had a lot of space at their disposal and used it well; this big SUV has a presence that is decidedly commanding. Long, flowing lines emphasize the Suburban’s considerable length instead of hiding it, and the broad front face owns the traffic lane. Dimensionally, the 2018 Suburban is about the same size as all those versions of years past, but then, when you’re talking about full-size SUVs, an inch here or there doesn’t make much of a difference.
Favorite FeaturesSUPERB INTERIOR Today’s Suburban bears little resemblance to the first vehicle to wear the name, with an interior that could easily grace any number of luxury cars. Wide comfortable seats, a sleek dash and intelligently designed controls are joined by 39.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 3rd-row seat.
 REAR SEAT REMINDER By monitoring the opening of the rear doors before the engine is started, Rear Seat Reminder operates by reminding the driver to check the rear seat for valuables, pets or children before exiting the vehicle. 
Standard FeaturesStandard on all Suburbans is the 5.3-liter V8 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission and a cavernous interior. The base-level LS trim has cloth seats, automatic climate control, rear parking sensors and the standard Chevrolet MyLink 8-inch diagonal touch screen that includes Bluetooth streaming audio, apps and other features. The mid-range LT trim has forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and the availability of features not offered on the LS. The Premier models add rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot alerts, up-level audio, heated and cooled seats, programmable power liftgate, 20-inch wheels and a boatload of other items.
Factory OptionsThe Suburban’s available-equipment list is extensive. Among the choices: Order the LS trim level with the front bench seat and Chevy’s biggest can haul nine people to the movies. Any trim can be equipped with the Driver Alert Package that adds low-speed forward automatic braking, IntelliBeam automatic high beams, lane-keep assist, driver-alert seat and power-adjustable pedals. For the LT version, we like the exceptionally comprehensive Luxury Package that adds many of the Premier’s luxury touches, and the Sun, Entertainment and Destinations Package that bundles navigation, a Blu-ray rear-seat entertainment system, a power sunroof and many other items.
Engine & TransmissionChevy’s sole powertrain for its 2018 Suburban is a fine one: the very well-proven 5.3-liter 355-horsepower V8 with a 6-speed automatic. The larger engines of years past have been dropped because very few people bought them. No loss; the 5.3 makes plenty of power, cranks out 383 lb-ft of torque, features direct fuel injection and Active Cylinder Management and, if not a fuel-economy leader, delivers efficiency which is at least reasonable, considering the big Suburban’s muscular capabilities. The smooth 6-speed automatic does a good job of keeping the engine in the best part of its power range and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optionally available. Maximum towing capacity with 2-wheel drive (2WD) is 8,300 pounds, so the 5.3 is more than willing and able.

Having first been introduced in 1935, the 2018 Chevrolet Suburban carries the industry’s longest-running nameplate. Still the go-to vehicle for big families with big needs, the Suburban is hard to beat. Its only real competition comes from the all-new extended-length Ford Expedition Max, a vehicle that offers a higher tow rating than the big Chevy by 1,000 pounds. But, the Suburban’s ace in the hole is its upscale interior, proven 5.3-liter V8 engine and numerous high-tech infotainment and driver-assist features. Neither the Nissan Armada nor Toyota Sequoia can match the Suburban’s dimensions, although those looking for even more power and even greater creature comforts can find it in the Suburban’s twin, the GMC Yukon Denali.

While most at home on the highway, the Avalon is easy to handle in the city and confined settings; it feels smaller than its size suggests. Power from the V6 is impressive. While the all-new V6 Camry now has more horsepower, the Avalon remains strong. It smoothly and effortlessly accelerates on freeway onramps, and has good oomph for passing. A Sport mode quickens throttle response and stiffens the steering feel. The Avalon is no corner-carver, but the Touring model has its own suspension system that offers more athletic handling. Unlike the buttery 6-speed automatic of the standard model, the hybrid Avalon has a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that can drone but helps this full-size Toyota sedan achieve fuel economy equated with an economy car.
Interior ComfortStep inside the 2018 Avalon and two traits immediately stand out: The first is that it’s roomy, and the second is that it’s lush and sophisticated. Roominess is most apparent in the rear, where passengers have 39.2 inches of legroom, over an inch more than the Camry. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, and the armrest between driver and passenger provides good separation. The flush, angular central display and capacitive touch switches look high-tech, but are mercifully quite easy to use. At 16 cubic feet, the Avalon’s trunk is huge, with hybrid models only losing 2 cubic feet to their battery.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Avalon’s athletic stance and sculpted bodywork were conceived by Toyota’s famed Southern California-based Calty Design studio. The forward-raked C-pillar and sweeping roofline impart an almost coupe-like silhouette. Although it seems counterintuitive, this aggressive design actually improves rear-seat headroom. The headlights incorporate a pair of stylish square-shaped projector lenses, which Toyota calls Quadrabeams. The massive maw that is the Avalon’s grille will likely be a love-it-or-hate-it affair. The rest of this Toyota sedan’s contemporary appeal is finished off with 17-inch or optional 18-inch alloy wheels, LED taillights and dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets.
Favorite FeaturesPREMIUM FEATURES, MAINSTREAM PRICE Take the badge off an Avalon, and you might think you’re in a Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand. In addition to its velvety V6 and hushed ride, the Avalon coddles with leather interior, heated front seats and nice touches like wood-grain interior trim.

It includes an array of active-safety and driver-assist features such as pre-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, radar-based adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams and lane-departure alert with steering assist.

While the Avalon can connect to iPhones and Android devices, it does not support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, offering instead various apps and Siri Eyes Free.

The conventional engine churns out a healthy 268 horsepower through a 6-speed automatic gearbox, while the hybrid system’s 200 total horsepower is transmitted via a gearless continuously variable transmission. Similar to a Prius or Toyota Camry Hybrid, the Avalon Hybrid doesn’t require you to plug the car in to charge it. The whole system is self-contained, self-managed and seamless. If not for the hybrid badges and slightly slower acceleration than the V6 model, many drivers might not even know it uses both a gasoline engine and an electric motor to move. All Avalons are front-wheel drive. All also feature Eco, Normal and Sport driving modes.

Read Full Review","What's New?After last year’s update to include the Toyota Safety Sense-P (TSS-P) suite of driver assists, the Avalon carries over unchanged for 2018 except for variations to some trim names. For example, the former XLE Touring trim simply becomes Touring.
The 2018 Toyota Avalon is the automaker’s flagship sedan, the larger, plusher brother to the Camry. The Avalon appeals to those who want a full-size sedan with presence, a roomy interior, impressive safety features and a ride quality that favors comfort over athleticism. Unlike the Chevrolet Impala, the Avalon comes standard with a V6 engine, and it stands apart from sportier rivals like the Nissan Maxima and Dodge Charger with a hybrid version that attains up to 40 mpg. While facing the same headwinds as other rivals — buyers favoring crossover SUVs to large sedans — the 2018 Avalon remains among the best of its kind thanks to its reputation for reliability, efficiency and Lexus-like refinement at a Toyota price.

Driving the Used 2018 Honda PilotIt only takes a few minutes behind the Pilot’s wheel to understand just how good this big SUV has become. From its comfortable ride to its responsive steering to its ability to run through tight curves with surprising agility, the Pilot never falters. Despite its size, the 2018 Honda Pilot feels nimble and easily maneuverable, the latter trait amplified by the Pilot’s tight turning radius. Sure, the Mazda CX-9 is probably a better-handling SUV, but it seats only seven and offers only a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. For our tastes, the ample low-end torque and powerful pulling power of the Pilot’s 280-horsepower V6 is more fitting for this type of vehicle. Inside, the Pilot features wide, comfortable front seats, logically arranged switchgear and instrumentation and commendably low levels of wind and tire noise. The cabin’s styling is a bit austere compared to new competitors, but it’s not unattractive by any measure.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Honda Pilot interior boasts soft-touch surfaces on the dash and doors, which combine with on-road quiet and comfortable seats for a sophisticated feel. The comfort combines with practicality with a generous cargo area, and a huge center console bin with plenty of storage space. Thankfully, Honda has upgraded its navigation system for one from Garmin, although not everyone will like the cartoonish colors. The 2nd-row seats are comfortable, and the one-touch folding mechanism borrowed from the Acura MDX eases 3rd-row access. We also like the multiple USB ports (up to five), and the available HD rear-entertainment system.
Exterior StylingFor 2018 the Honda Pilot shuns the first two generations’ boxy styling in favor of sleek lines that are clearly designed to evoke a family resemblance to the smaller CR-V and HR-V. While it no longer stands out in a parking lot, the current Pilot SUV looks better overall. We particularly like the LED accents in the headlights, and a taillight design that reflects the same pattern. However, some may find the cargo floor is a couple inches higher than need be, while others will lament that the glass on the rear hatch no longer opens independently of the hatch itself.
Favorite FeaturesHONDA SENSING Honda’s suite of driver-safety assists includes lane-keeping assist, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation and braking and road-departure mitigation. They’re all part of the Honda Sensing system that is optional on EX trims and standard on Touring and Elite.
 UNDER-FLOOR STORAGE Storage space is always at a premium in an SUV filled with kids, pets and luggage, which is why we think you’ll appreciate the hidden cargo hold behind the Pilot’s 3rd-row seat. Adding about three cubic feet of storage with the seat up, the space includes a reversible carpeted cargo cover that can be stored at the bottom of the well when not in use. 
Standard FeaturesThe basic front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2018 Honda Pilot LX comes standard with a multi-angle rearview camera and a tire-pressure-monitoring system that flashes the lights when you’ve filled a tire to its proper pressure. Cruise control, audio and phone controls are all located on the steering wheel, and all Pilots come with Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch information screen between the gauges, push-button start, and an Eco mode to help fuel economy. Still, it’s worth upgrading to at least the EX model, which adds Intelligent Traction Management system, an upgraded audio system that includes HondaLink, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Honda’s clever LaneWatch right-side-view camera.
Factory OptionsThe 2018 Honda Pilot breaks most of its options into different trim levels. For example, if you want things like dynamic guidelines on your rearview camera, you’ll have to step up to the EX model. If you want leather, you’re in EX-L territory. The 9-speed automatic is standard once you get to Touring and Elite models. All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on all models, except for the Elite, where it’s standard. Also available on all new Honda Pilot models (besides the LX) is the Honda Sensing suite of collision and road-departure mitigation and warning, lane-departure warning, active cruise and lane-keeping assist.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine available for the 2018 Honda Pilot: a 3.5-liter V6 putting out 280 horsepower. This engine is offered with either a 6-speed automatic or, in Touring and Elite models, a 9-speed automatic. We were impressed by the 9-speed transmission’s operation, particularly because this ZF-supplied transmission has received mixed reviews in other manufacturers’ cars. All models offer AWD, and the sophisticated system is standard on Elite models. Interestingly, a traction-management system that optimizes the AWD and FWD function for snow, mud or other surfaces is standard on all but LX models. The engine offers an Eco mode that shuts off half the cylinders under light throttle to help improve fuel economy.
 3.5-liter V6 280 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 262 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/27 mpg (6-speed automatic, FWD), 18/26 mpg (6-speed automatic, AWD), 20/27 mpg (9-speed automatic, FWD), 19/26 mpg (9-speed automatic, AWD)
Read Full Review","What's New?There are no major changes to the 2018 Honda Pilot.
The 2018 Honda Pilot remains a formidable 3-row crossover SUV, but competition both domestically and abroad is giving Honda’s full-size family hauler a run for its money. The Pilot’s recent restyling already looks a bit tame when compared to the Nissan Pathfinder and Mazda CX-9, and those more concerned with maximum interior room will find more to like in a Chevrolet Traverse. The 8-passenger Pilot has remained current with the latest driver-safety-assist features including adaptive cruise control and crash-detection and -mitigation systems, but its infotainment system isn’t as user-friendly as those found on GM, Ford and Dodge brands. The Pilot is also primarily an on-road SUV, with a comfortable ride, agile handling and respectable highway fuel economy, but no off-road chops.

If you want the well-regarded driving dynamics of that sedan in a sleeker package or with a retractable-hardtop roof, the 4 Series is it. As for the 4-door Gran Coupe, it blends fine handling, sharp looks and strong practicality.","ConsImpressive as the 4 Series lineup is, these luxury-performance coupes aren’t the only game in town. You may prefer the tech advances of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and new Audi A5, or the fresh and fluid lines of the Lexus RC and Infiniti Q60.",43195,"Driving the Used 2018 BMW 4 SeriesThe 2018 4 Series takes the agility, acceleration and balance of the 3 Series and strengthens it with a wider stance and lower center of gravity. It makes the 2-door versions of the 4 Series the perfect partner for enthusiasts who still relish the act of driving, and who won’t mind the trade-offs of increased road noise and a stiffer ride. The Gran Coupe, however, is aimed at the grand touring crowd, and it does a grand job. We love its blend of lively yet smooth road manners and appreciable space for cargo and passengers. Base 430i models use BMW’s 248-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder. It’s one of our favorite 4-cylinder engines and in truth will satisfy the majority of drivers. Those craving even more punch can opt for 440i models with the 320-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder. If you’re really maniacal about power, there’s the 2018 BMW M4, a beast that gets its own review.
Interior ComfortThe BMW 4 Series coupe and convertible models have four seats, but only the front two are suitable for adults for longer durations. The rear seats are tight on leg- and headroom (convertible notwithstanding), and it’s not particularly easy to get back there in hardtop models. The Gran Coupe’s rear doors and elongated roof do improve access. In all models it’s the one behind the steering wheel who’s truly pampered, with a driver-focused cockpit, easy-to-reach controls and an improved iDrive infotainment system. Cargo space is fine in the coupes, but the Gran Coupe has more than 45 cubic feet with rear seats folded.
Exterior StylingThe BMW 4 Series has been updated for 2018, but the revisions are minor: a restyled nose, larger central air intake, and elongated design of the rear light clusters. Not surprisingly, the 4 Series coupe and convertible look the most alike. With its hardtop roof up, the convertible essentially is a 4 Series coupe. It’s the 2018 4 Series Gran Coupe that stands out. Though the same length as its siblings, the Gran Coupe can appear longer with its four doors and elongated roof. Instead of a trunk, the Gran Coupe has a rear hatch for easy loading and unloading of gear.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINEWe said that the old base-level engine in the 4 Series was good enough that there was little reason to shell out for the 6-cylinder variant. That’s truer still with this latest engine, which arrived last year. It’s more powerful, and at up to 34 mpg, impressively efficient.
FOLDING HARDTOPThe BMW 4 Series convertible doesn’t force you to choose between a classic coupe or open-top convertible, thanks to its power-operated retractable hardtop. Top up, it’s a sharp coupe with the classic BMW ""Hofmeister kink"" at the rear window; top down you have open-air enjoyment for yourself and three passengers.
Standard FeaturesBase 430i versions of the 2018 BMW 4 Series Coupe, Gran Coupe and Convertible may look different, but all have similar standard equipment. There are 10-way-power front seats, LED headlights, automatic climate control, and on the Coupe and Gran Coupe, a moonroof; the Gran Coupe also gets a power tailgate. Standard infotainment is a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio system with USB audio input, Bluetooth streaming and 6.5-inch display (unfortunately, a rearview camera still costs extra). The 440i offers the stronger 6-cylinder engine. New BMWs come with Ultimate Care, which includes three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsIn true German luxury-car fashion, there’s a plethora of ways to upgrade and personalize your 4 Series. You can upgrade to a 16-speaker/600-watt harman/kardon sound system, a hands-free trunk that opens when you wave your foot under the bumper, and leather upholstery to replace the synthetic SensaTec material. Most options are bundled into packages, like the Technology Package that includes navigation and dedicated apps. A Driver Assistance package adds the blind-spot monitoring and Active Driving Assistant with lane-departure warning, collision-mitigation automatic braking and pedestrian detection. Also available are wireless charging for compatible smartphones and a Wi-Fi hotspot.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available in the 2018 BMW 4 Series. Base 430i models use a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder good for 248 horsepower, while the more powerful 440i models pack a 3.0-liter turbocharged 6-cylinder that makes 320 horsepower. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is the standard setup, and BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. Most models are mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission that is nearly flawless. For the ""save-the-manuals"" crowd, a stick shift is still available in the 430i coupe, 440i coupe and 440i xDrive coupe. Auto start/stop is standard on the 430i and 440i models; if you don’t like the jarring restarts you can shut it off. Also note these premium engines require premium gasoline.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2018, the BMW 4 Series receives new front and rear exterior tweaks, stiffer suspension and upgraded steering, new exterior colors and four new rim choices. Adaptive full LED headlights are now available, while interior mods include a new steering-wheel rim and freshened digital interface for models with navigation.
The 2018 BMW 4 Series is available in three forms: a coupe, a retractable-hardtop convertible, and a 4-door liftback called the Gran Coupe. The first two, with their 2-door/4-passenger configurations, prioritize sportiness, while the 5-passenger Gran Coupe adds a surprising dose of practicality thanks to its large rear cargo bay. All are offered with turbocharged 4- or 6-cylinder engines and rear- or all-wheel-drive (RWD, AWD). The high-performance M4 (reviewed separately), meanwhile, comes in coupe or convertible form. In true BMW fashion, a manual transmission is still offered, which sets the 4 Series apart from rivals like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe, Infiniti Q60 and Lexus RC (a stick still exists in the Audi A5 and Cadillac ATS coupe). Minor updates keep the 4 Series fresh for 2018.

Even those new to the brand should take a look though, as the Equinox is a good-looking, nice-driving, and nicely featured compact SUV. Let’s not forget the fuel-smart diesel and more powerful 4-cylinder.","ConsIf you demand the highest-tech safety features at the lowest possible price, then the fact that the new Equinox saves its active safety for the top-line Premier model may turn you off. Road trippers will miss the availability of active cruise control, too.",24500,"Driving the Used 2018 Chevrolet EquinoxFor now, the only engine available in the 2018 Equinox is the 1.5-liter turbo, with 170 horsepower. Good news is that it’s a more than satisfactory powerplant for the Equinox. With a 6-speed automatic driving either the front wheels or all four wheels, the little turbo handily gets the Equinox going, even on the hilly roads around the border between the Carolinas. At stops, Chevrolet has practically perfected its idle-stop feature to the point that we don’t mind there’s no “off” switch. There’s a surprising bite to the suspension around town, not uncomfortable, but enough that you’re rewarded when you test the cornering ability of the Equinox. The powerful 2.0-liter engine isn’t let down by the chassis, delivers strong passing torque on the highway, and is rated to tow an impressive 3,500 pounds. The new Equinox is quiet as well, making it easy to enjoy a conversation or just listen to the audio system. In parking lots, the around-view camera considerably aids maneuverability.
Interior ComfortChevrolet may have shrunk the Equinox exterior by several inches, but it managed to keep the interior dimensions close enough to its larger predecessor that you’re unlikely to notice the difference. What you will notice is the additional refinement. The Equinox boasts soft-touch surfaces where they matter on the doors and center console, and a textured paint that gives hard surfaces a softer veneer. The front and rear seats are admirably comfortable, and the rear seats offer heaters, unusual for the class. While the new Equinox loses a bit of cargo room, it’s mitigated by the under-floor storage.
Exterior StylingLike its Cruze cousin, the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox debuts as one of the best looking vehicles in its class. While not dazzling us with styling excesses, the Equinox nonetheless goes from dowdy to daring, with sharp lines, tasteful chrome accents, and spot-on proportions. We like the way the Chevy family grille has evolved over the past couple years, and it looks particularly good on the blunter face of an SUV, unlike some other family faces. The available Redline package adds black-out trim and other sporty touches, and it looks good as long as you can perfectly synchronize the red stripes on the wheels when you stop.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBO
Yes, we love diesels for their torque and fuel economy. And we love powerful, turbocharged 4-cylinders because…well, they’re quick. While no Porsche Macan, the Equinox has good enough handling chops that we wanted more power than the 1.5-liter turbo offered. Luckily, there’s 252-horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque available with the Equinox’s new 2.0-liter four.
1.6-LITER DIESEL ENGINE
Chevrolet has given us a 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine that you just don’t see in the class anymore. With an estimated 39 highway mpg, it promises plenty of drive time in between stops to the pump.
Standard FeaturesThe price-leader 2018 Equinox L model comes with niceties like keyless door locks and ignition, and a rear-view camera. The 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system includes Bluetooth for streaming music and for phones, and also features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto standard. High-tech features include start-stop for the 1.5-liter turbo 4-cylinder engine, an electronic parking brake, a USB port and auxiliary input for the audio system, and even active noise cancellation and a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. Safety features include 10 airbags and stability control, and for an extra nth of fuel economy there are active shutters in the grille that close at speed for better aerodynamics.
Factory OptionsBesides all-wheel drive and your choice of the more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder or fuel-efficient diesel, most options are defined by trim level. The LT is the most mainstream model, and it adds HID headlights, a power driver’s seat with lumbar, heated outside mirrors, and cargo-area-mounted rear seatback releases. The Premier adds leather seats with memory, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alert, a hands-free power liftgate, dual-zone climate control, and additional USB ports. Active safety systems like collision mitigation and lane-keeping assist are only available on the Premier as part of an option package; navigation and a panoramic sunroof are also available.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine on the 2018 Equinox is a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 170 horsepower. It’s a surprisingly stout engine in the Equinox, and even with the 6-speed automatic transmission, it offers decent acceleration in both front-wheel drive (FWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) models. If that’s not enough, you can upgrade to a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 252 horsepower and a 9-speed automatic transmission, or the 1.6-liter diesel 4-cylinder with its 236 lb-ft of torque and a 6-speed automatic. Fuel economy promises to be competitive, although the diesel — with as much as 39 mpg highway economy — could wind up being the class leader.

If these areas are of concern to you, explore some alternatives.",21000,"Driving the Used 2016 Honda CR-ZThe 2016 CR-Z might send a bit of a mixed message. Its zowie-zoomy styling hints at handling and road prowess out of a ""Transformers"" movie, but it’s not quite that. Still, it’s no slouch, either. Helping move things along, its hybrid powertrain and electric-assist motor can deliver a big jolt of low-end torque that can have the CR-Z jumping through traffic or easily ripping to freeway-merge speed. Suspension tuning is aimed more at a commuter afternoon than a track day, but it offers a good blend of everyday comfort with predictable, precise and more than merely capable handling response. The 3-mode system gives the driver choices of a more efficient Econ setting, Normal or a Sport selection that increases throttle response and steering effort. The available CVT automatic is seamlessly smooth, but our choice is Honda’s precise and rewarding 6-speed manual.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Honda CR-Z is as edgy inside as outside. In front of the driver and near at hand is a pod of knobs and buttons, with major operation functions within easy reach. Just to the right of center is the 7-inch Display Audio, now standard on all trim levels, which allows control of the audio system and other features just like on a tablet or smartphone. The seats are comfortable and the bolstering helps hold occupants in place, and new this year is an EX-L Navi model with heated leather seats and navigation.
Exterior StylingNothing else on the road looks like the CR-Z. Honda has certainly offered little 2-seater coupes – the CRX, the Insight – but nothing like this. The exterior is new for 2016, with an unmistakably chiseled snout, a big black grille opening and convoluted spoiler leading to a rising wedge that ends in a nearly-flat hatch (the rear wiper is far more horizontal than vertical) and big taillights that no one will miss. The multitude of details of its shape show up much more clearly in red or blue, but in black it looks sinister enough for a sci-fi movie.
Favorite FeaturesPLUS SPORT SYSTEM The Honda CR-Z hybrid features a nifty Plus Sport button. Push it and the CR-Z gets a quick burst of power to assist when overtaking slower traffic or darting across intersections. 
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION The CR-Z’s 6-speed manual transmission is a novelty in this field. And while it may penalize you a few mpg, the fun it delivers is worth its weight in gold.
Standard FeaturesStandard equipment on the 2016 CR-Z LX base model includes a 160-watt, 6-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, 7-inch Display Audio with customizable feature settings, speed-sensitive volume control, automatic climate control, push-button start, tilt-and-telescopic steering column, steering-wheel-mounted controls, reverse-linked rear wiper/washer and rearview camera. Also on board are all the expected and government-mandated driving aids and safety items, including stability control, anti-lock brakes, the usual full complement of airbags and other occupant-protection features, and active head restraints.
Factory OptionsWith the 2016 CR-Z the optional features are grouped into the two upper trim levels, the EX and EX-L Navi. To the base LX the EX adds LED daytime running lights, Honda LaneWatch, high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, fog lights, heated mirrors, illuminated window switches, leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum pedals, console lighting, and a 360-watt, 7-speaker Premium audio. The EX-L Navi adds leather-trimmed and heated front seats, navigation and HD Radio; this would be our recommendation, with the 6-speed manual transmission.
Engine & TransmissionThe gasoline/electric powertrain for the 2016 Honda CR-Z has a 1.5-liter i-VTEC engine mated to a 15-kilowatt motor, combining to deliver 130 horsepower. This combination is the sixth iteration of Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) technology since its debut in the original Honda Insight for the 2000 model year. While 130 horsepower might not sound like much, the broad torque curve makes freeway passing and darting through intersections a breeze. One thing we do not care for is the auto-stop feature, a fuel-saving measure that shuts off the engine when the vehicle is at a complete stop and often causes annoying judder upon restarting.

Accessories and options include heated leather seats.
The 2016 Honda CR-Z is edgy sports coupe meeting green commuter; rock ‘n roll played on a lute. With zoomy and zowie looks, a neat interior, sporty handling, decent fuel economy and an environmentally friendly hybrid powertrain, it’s a hyper-drive answer to the old question of moving two people in an efficient and fun manner. Somewhat in the tradition of the Honda CRX 2-seater, the CR-Z offers a modern take with a hybrid powertrain, the latest in safety and infotainment features and sci-fi movie styling. As with the fondly remembered CRX, the CR-Z is only for two, but has ample room for those two and generous cargo space under the hatch. Economical commuter car? Yep. Boring? Nope.

Read Full Review","What's New?The current-generation Q50 debuted for the 2014 model year, but has undergone a steady stream of significant enhancements since. Exterior updates this year include revised front and rear styling along with new taillights across the board, with 3.0t Sport and Red Sport 400 models distinguished by a more aggressive front fascia. Interior changes include a new steering wheel, new shift knob and more stitching. The trim grades have also been rethought, with the lineup now divided into Pure, Luxe, Sport and Red Sport 400 versions. And if you were holding out until Infiniti offered the Q50 in a Mocha Almond coating, now’s the time to grab your checkbook and run to the dealer.
The freshly upgraded 2018 Infiniti Q50 remains one of the best values in a highly competitive field of sporty, small luxury sedans. Gorgeous, comfortable and boasting one of the lowest starting prices in its class, Infiniti’s best-selling model also has a distinct power advantage when outfitted with its most popular engine, a 300-horsepower turbocharged V6. There are trade-offs, too, but the 2018 Infiniti Q50 is a better luxury sport sedan than almost any segment shopper needs, even if it doesn’t offer everything everyone wants.
Used 2018 INFINITI Q50 PricingOne of the 2018 Infiniti Q50’s key strengths is offering more features for less money, especially compared to European entries like the A4, 3 Series and C-Class. In addition to a sticker price advantage, the Infiniti Q50 typically has been offered with more competitive lease rates and other incentives. Resale values have typically been in the bottom half of the segment, but the difference is often more than offset by the lower purchase and lease prices.
Driving the Used 2018 INFINITI Q50While the sweet spot in the 2018 Infiniti Q50 lineup is the 3.0t — an excellent blend of luxury, performance and value, and the best-selling model in the bunch — our first taste of the updated 2018 Infiniti Q50 took place near the automaker’s U.S. headquarters in Tennessee, where we drove 400-horsepower Q50 Red Sport 400 models exclusively. The Q50’s 2018 update included few dynamic changes, so the car felt familiar. While the added power is entertaining and addictive, the overall performance driving experience isn’t particularly satisfying. Our test vehicles were equipped with Infiniti’s Direct Adaptive Steering, a technically and functionally impressive setup that does more for lower-speed drivability than higher-energy jaunts.
 But unless you’re big into carving canyons and demand an unfiltered, telepathic connection between you, the car and the road, the 2018 Infiniti Q50 should be plenty sporty for you. And while it also tips the scales a couple hundred pounds heavier than the segment’s legendary driver’s car, the BMW 3 Series, the Q50 3.0t significantly overpowers its closest competitors with its 300-horsepower rating. In addition to the effortless and confidence-inspiring acceleration afforded by all that power, daily driving highlights include terrific seats and soft touchpoints that help create a palpable sense of luxury. To sit in the Q50 is to sink into it, but just enough to enhance the feelings of both comfort and control.
Interior ComfortSoft, high-quality materials, a performance-themed gauge cluster and a digitally enhanced, dual-screen center stack all come together in a passenger cabin that’s rich, sporty and contemporary at once. It’s an appealing combination that’s not easy to pull together.
 There isn’t a whole lot of personal storage up front — a common theme across the category — but the cup holders are decent in size and placement, and there’s a useful bin under the center armrest.
 The 2018 Infiniti Q50 is strong in tech overall, but it’s showing its age in the infotainment department. The lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility is quickly becoming a bigger shortcoming as the list of competitors that offer a couple of our favorite features has grown to include the Acura TLX, Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and others (Lexus IS notwithstanding). And while the dual-screen setup is visually impressive, it’s more compelling on paper than in practice. With that said, we like the high-resolution touch screen and find it easy to perform most functions.
 Other highlights include an impressive 16-speaker Bose audio system and an Around View Monitor with Moving Object Detection. Using cameras on each side of the vehicle, Infiniti’s Around View Monitor gives you a simulated bird’s-eye view of the vehicle and its surroundings, making it easy to park like a pro. It also gives you a warning if the cameras detect a moving object nearby.
 The Infiniti Q50’s rear seat is among the roomier such accommodations in the category, and backseat drivers would be much happier barking suggestions from the back of the Q50 than from the rear quarters of the Lexus IS, for instance. Trunk room is similarly on par with the category, while buyers looking for added cargo flexibility should consider the available 60/40 split-folding rear seatbacks.
Exterior StylingWe’re fans of the Q50’s sporty but substantial look, which has been enhanced for 2018. While the visual updates are comprehensive, the effect is evolutionary on the whole. A key change is further visual differentiation between trim grades, with the Q50 3.0t Sport and Q50 Red Sport 400 now distinguished by a unique face featuring a bolder bumper and wider, lower air intakes.
Favorite FeaturesDYNAMIC DIGITAL SUSPENSION The Infiniti Q50’s available adaptive suspension features adjustable dampers that allow you to choose between a more comfortable ride and sportier handling.
 V6 POWER We’re on board with the industry’s move to turbocharged 4-cylinder engines in place of thirstier, heavier 6-cylinder powerplants, but there’s much to be said for the buttery power delivery of a V6.
Standard FeaturesAt its starting sticker price of $34,200, a 2018 Infiniti Q50 2.0t includes a voice-controllable, dual-display infotainment system with 8-inch upper and 7-inch lower touch screens, USB and Bluetooth phone/audio connectivity, backup camera, keyless entry and start-up, leatherette seats, power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, HD and satellite radio, plus a full complement of LED headlights, fog lights and taillights.
Factory OptionsInfiniti has developed a reputation for introducing innovative technologies, for which the 2018 Q50 is a rolling showcase. In addition to expected optional niceties like real leather seating, upgraded audio and a navigation system, check out the impressive list of driver-assist and safety technologies offered on the Q50:

Direct Adaptive Steering
Dynamic Digital Suspension

Active Lane Control
Active Trace Control
Intelligent Cruise Control

Engine & TransmissionAs you’ll see below, the 2018 Infiniti Q50 has one of the segment’s most comprehensive engine lineups. The bread-and-butter 300-horsepower engine offers more oomph than the competition at that price, and each of the four powertrains is available in conjunction with rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD).

Driving the Used 2018 Toyota HighlanderPowered by a recently revised 3.5-liter V6 mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, the 2018 Toyota Highlander is both powerful and fuel-efficient. Although the standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder, its 185 horses haven’t kept up with the Highlander’s growing dimensions. Trust us, if you carry more than two people, need power for passing and merging or pull a small trailer, the V6 is the engine you’ll want (and need). Still thinking you need 4-cylinder fuel economy? Check out the Highlander Hybrid. It’s combined electric/gasoline motor output reaches 306 horsepower, yet it can travel nearly 30 miles in the city on a single gallon of gas. Regardless of engine choice, the Highlander makes a great family carrier, with good steering feedback, a tight turning radius, comfortable yet controlled ride and excellent crash-test scores. The sporty SE trim delivers the best handling and looks without any noticeable impact on ride comfort.
Interior ComfortThe 2018 Toyota Highlander interior is largely unchanged from the previous iteration. We like that there are numerous USB ports, attractive seat upholstery, and a few other selective trim upgrades. All things considered, the Highlander’s interior is one of its strong points. The comfortable front- and 2nd-row seats are great for long drives, and little ones in the third row will be satisfied, although adults should skip it. The dash-width shelf up front is perfect for your wallet, smartphone, keys or whatever else, and the huge center console bin can easily swallow anything too big for the shelf.
Exterior StylingThe 2018 Highlander’s grille is huge, following the big-grille trend that’s been stylish for the past few years. Yet it emphasizes the already blunt nose of this midsize SUV, with different models getting different trims, seeming to shrink the headlights in the process. The rest of the Highlander isn’t as dramatic, although the sporty Highlander SE features a blackout trim package that tones down the grille and ultimately looks pretty good. The latest styling trend further emboldens a design that was already a departure of sorts from the Highlander’s bland predecessors, and although the grille won’t appeal to everybody, it’s certainly distinctive.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM
With the Highlander’s Driver Easy Speak, cries of “DON’T MAKE ME PULL THIS CAR OVER” are reduced to a mere vocal warning via an intercom system that allows the driver’s intention to be conveyed loud and clear to 3rd-row-seat occupants.
FLIP-UP REAR HATCH WINDOW
The Highlander’s 2-piece rear hatch offers the convenience of a flip-up glass window. This design makes it easier to load and unload items without valuable cargo rolling out the back, or the family pooch making a break for freedom.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2018 Highlander LE still comes with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, a combo good for fuel economy but not much else. However, it also comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense Plus (TSS-P), which bundles high-tech safety gear like active cruise control, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, and lane-departure alert and warning. There’s 8-passenger seating, standard rearview camera, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, day/night rearview mirror, and three 12-volt auxiliary power outlets (two up front and one in the second row), and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display with Toyota’s Entune audio system, Bluetooth and voice recognition.
Factory OptionsMost options are added by trim level; the LE Plus adds 3-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen display and faux-leather seats; the XLE gets real leather and better infotainment that includes navigation; Limited and Limited Platinum get even better audio systems, heated and ventilated front seats, and even an around-view camera, heated steering wheel and heated 2nd-row seats in the Limited Platinum. A panoramic moonroof is available, plus rear-seat entertainment including Blu-ray and DVD, Driver Easy Speak, and of course the V6 or Hybrid powertrains.
Engine & TransmissionThree basic powertrain choices face 2018 Highlander buyers. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there’s the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, including hybrids, but unless you need the extra traction for foul weather, we suggest skipping it in favor of the better fuel economy you get from front-wheel drive (FWD).

The 2018 Toyota Highlander continues to be the choice for families seeking a safe, secure and comfortable 8-passenger crossover SUV, but one that isn’t boring or lacking modern amenities. After a complete refresh last year, the 2018 Highlander is again poised to take on rivals like the Honda Pilot, Chevrolet Traverse and Nissan Pathfinder. To accomplish this, the Highlander offers a standard suite of driver-safety assists including pre-collision warning and braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning. And, while its various infotainment systems lack Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, they are up to date in every other aspect. Those concerned with fuel economy can opt for the Highlander Hybrid that delivers class-leading city-fuel-economy figures.

It may be Porsche’s least expensive model, but it’s still a Porsche, which means it is beautifully built, impeccably tuned and fun to drive.","ConsAlthough Porsche offers a plug-in hybrid version of its larger Cayenne SUV as well as its Panamera sedan, it does not offer an electrified version of the 2018 Macan. If you’re looking for a luxury-hybrid SUV in this class, and the $80,000 Cayenne E-hybrid is too far out, check out the Lexus NX 300h or the larger Lexus RX 450h.",80000,"What's New?For 2018 Porsche has created new interior and exterior colors for the Macan. More important, Porsche will now pay for the SUV’s first year’s scheduled maintenance. The 2018 Macan is also now fitted with an improved carbon filter to keep more particles, pollen, odors and dust from inside its interior.
A small SUV with big horsepower and athletic handling, the 2018 Porsche Macan offers families an impressive mix of utility and invigorating performance. All-wheel drive is standard while the Macan’s wide range of available engines offers as much as 440 horsepower. Five models are offered, Macan, Macan S, Macan GTS, Macan Turbo and Macan Turbo with Performance Package. With a base price of around $50,000, the Porsche’s key competitors include the Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace, Mercedes GLC, BMW X3 and the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio. But the Macan Turbo models are big bucks starting around $79,000. Better viewed as a tall, all-wheel-drive (AWD) hatch than rugged off-roader, the Macan is aimed at those seeking SUV functionality and sports-car performance. But its utility is limited. Cargo space is less than its rivals.
Used 2018 Porsche Macan PricingWith the 4-cylinder Macan, price of entry into the lineup — and the Porsche brand — has dropped to around $50,000, Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). That’s nearly $8,000 less than last year’s Macan S, which now starts around $58,000. The 2018 Macan GTS opens around $70,000, and the Macan Turbo jumps to over $77,000. And adding the Performance Package to that, with its 40 more horsepower, adds another $10,000 to the bottom line. At these prices, the Macan is among the priciest of the compact-luxury vehicles. The Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC and BMW X3 start several thousand below a base Macan, as do the Jaguar F-Pace and the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Macan’s resale value is expected to be great. In fact, last year’s model won the Best Resale Value Award in its class.
Driving the Used 2018 Porsche MacanFrom behind its thick leather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel the 2018 Porsche Macan is a wonderful blend of SUV and sports car. It’s one of the sportiest SUVs available, and it’s an engaging drive from the instant you fire up its turbocharged engine. Even the ""slowest"" model is fast. The 4-cylinder base model is able to rush to 60 mph in just over six seconds. The Macan S and GTS shave another second off that time, while the range-topping Macan Turbo goes 0-60 mph in as little as 4.2 seconds. Not all that long ago, that was 911 territory. Porsche’s all-wheel-drive system maximizes traction and allows the SUV to corner hard enough to strain your neck muscles. But the Macan isn’t all speed and thrills, it’s also comfortable and rides well. From the driver’s seat the Macan feels like it was carved from granite, but toss it into a corner and it somehow feels light on its feet. That’s a neat trick.
Interior ComfortInside, the Macan surrounds you with high-quality materials, an abundance of aluminum trim and a dynamic layout of controls and buttons. The key is to the left of the steering wheel, a Porsche tradition. Don’t worry, you get used to it. The instrumentation is clear and simple, but the rev counter is in the center as it is in Porsche’s sports cars. Don’t worry, you get used to it. Seat comfort is excellent. The seats are firm and well bolstered for performance driving. The buttons on the console that run alongside the shifter look complicated but they’re not. Second-row legroom is stingy, however, as is cargo space. The Macan’s 17.7-cubic-foot cargo floor is small for the class, although it expands to 53 cubic feet by dropping the 40/20/40-split/folding 2nd-row seatbacks.
Exterior StylingWith its tapered nose, low roofline and fast backlight, the 2018 Macan bears a strong resemblance to the larger Porsche Cayenne as well as the brand’s Panamera sedan. It looks tough with a butchy bad-boy stance and a hunkered-down attitude. All trim levels boast bi-xenon headlights and fog lights, while the GTS and Turbo models have unique, more aggressive front fascias. GTS models also have a matte-black finish on the side blades and a more dynamic color scheme. They also sit 10 mm lower than Turbo models. The Macan Turbo, meanwhile, can be identified via its front spoiler lip and squared-off quad exhaust outlets.
Favorite FeaturesACTIVE AERODYNAMICS Porsche sweats the details, especially when it comes to performance. An example is the Macan’s active aerodynamics. Porsche has equipped the Macan’s front grille with a shutter door that closes on relaxed drives when cooling requirements are low to improve aerodynamics and fuel economy. When more power is demanded by the driver, the shutter opens to improve airflow to cool the engine.
7-SPEED PDK AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION Called PDK, short for Porsche Doppelkupplung, which is German for dual clutch, the 7-speed automatic transmission is a marvel of engineering. It’s smooth and effortless around town, it shifts gears quicker than any human can, and it’s a great match for the Macan’s turbocharged engines. It also has a manual mode so you can utilize the Macan’s paddle shifters.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Macan base model costs thousands less than the Macan S but still comes nicely equipped. On hand are tri-zone climate control, lane-departure warning system, rearview camera with front and rear parking assist, power-folding side mirrors, power-operated liftgate, and 18-inch wheels. A fresh infotainment system is highlighted by a 7-inch multi-touch screen with AM/FM/HD/satellite radio with CD/DVD player, USB/aux inputs and Bluetooth connectivity. In addition to a more powerful V6 engine, Macan S models also have rain-sensing windshield wipers and tinted and thermally insulated glass. For 2018 Porsche has also added a year of complimentary scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsMore powerful still, Macan GTS models have 20-inch wheels, suspension setting and other performance upgrades, while the top-line Macan Turbo boasts navigation, Bose audio, Alcantara roof lining, adaptive seats and active suspension. Option packages range from a sweet Burmester audiophile system to a panoramic roof, and Porsche Connect Plus module with wireless Internet access, Google Earth integration and Apple CarPlay, plus a rear-entertainment system and heated/ventilated front seats. Customization options abound, as do performance upgrades that include Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus, $8,150 carbon-ceramic brakes and the recommendable Sport Chrono Package with Sport Plus mode, launch control and dash-mounted analog/digital stopwatch.
Engine & TransmissionThe base model is the first Macan to use a 4-cylinder, a turbocharged 2.0-liter that makes 252 horsepower, enough to zip this performance SUV from 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds (or 6.1 with the Sport Chrono package). At just over 3,900 pounds, this is also the lightest Macan. All others use a twin-turbo V6 engine — a 3.0-liter in S and GTS models and a larger 3.6-liter in the Turbo models. All Macans use a 7-speed PDK automatic transmission and are all-wheel drive. For better fuel efficiency, they have an auto start/stop system that switches off the engine at traffic stops. Start-ups can be abrupt, and thankfully the system is defeatable. A V6 Macan can tow up to 4,409 pounds. 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Macan)252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,800 rpm273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/25 mpg

Also, Mitsubishi’s reliability ratings aren’t exactly class-leading, and the very popular Honda CR-V and Nissan Rogue have traditionally held their values much better than the Outlander.
What's New?For 2018 a 7-inch touch screen and a rearview camera are standard on every Mitsubishi Outlander. Blind Spot Warning, Lane Change Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and a Remote Power Tailgate have been added to the SEL trim. The Outlander GT gets a standard multi-view camera and heated steering wheel. New to the lineup is the Outlander PHEV plug-in hybrid, which comes with all-wheel drive and can travel up to 22 miles on electricity alone.
With seating for seven, the highest crash-test ratings and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is an affordable compact SUV that’s perfect for families on a tight budget. One of the few small-crossover SUVs available with a third row, the new Outlander is offered in five trims, each available with all-wheel drive. Additionally, a new plug-in hybrid model makes it the only SUV in its class to offer such an electrified powertrain. Prices start under $25,000 for a front-wheel-drive base ES model with a 166-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and rise to around $33,000 for a GT with a stronger V6. The new Outlander competes with the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Dodge Journey, Kia Sorento and Toyota RAV4. (The smaller Outlander Sport is reviewed separately.)
Used 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a base 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander ES starts just under $25,000. The more recommendable SE models start only $1,000 more. The Outlander LE and SEL begin just over $27,000, and the V6-powered GT trims starts closer to $32,500. The new Outlander PHEV begins around $35,500 for an SEL model and $41,000 for a GT. However, these plug-in hybrid models are eligible for up to $5,836 in federal tax credits. Compared with the Outlander’s closest competitor, the Kia Sorento, the Mitsubishi’s starting price is nearly $2,000 less. The larger Dodge Journey, meanwhile, starts around $22,250 — but a third row of seats costs extra. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Outlander. In resale value, the Outlander has traditionally held up well with residuals on par with or even better than the Sorento, better than the Dodge Journey, but below 5-passenger crossover SUVs like the Mazda CX-5 and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.
Driving the Used 2018 Mitsubishi OutlanderWith 166 horsepower, the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander has about the same amount of power as a Nissan Rogue, but quite a bit less than a Honda CR-V. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is backed by an excellent CVT automatic transmission, and delivers surprisingly strong off-the-line acceleration and up to 30 mpg out on the highway. Unfortunately, those who haul a full complement of passengers and cargo won’t be impressed by the 4-cylinder’s passing power or uphill climbing ability. For these situations, the GT model’s much more powerful V6 and 6-speed automatic transmission are indispensable. The V6 also offers more grunt off the line and comes with the more advanced all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. Unfortunately, unlike the 4-cylinder, it requires more expensive premium fuel. On the road, we found the new Outlander’s ride on the firm side, its steering somewhat numb on-center and its handling acceptable, but still not on par with the Mazda CX-5.
Interior Comfort All models of the new 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander except for the PHEV come standard with seating for seven. Seat comfort is very good, the materials are nice, the design is clean and the interior is pleasantly quiet. Controls are easy to use, and attractive dark bamboo-like accents give the interior a premium feel, as does the new black-gloss finish on the center floor console. Flipping and folding the second row is easy thanks to a system of straps and levers and it offers easy entrance to the very small third row. Fold down both rows and you create over 63 cubic feet of cargo space. The plug-in hybrid Outlander has two rows and seating for five, as the rear area of its subfloor houses one of its two electric motors.
Exterior StylingSimple and understated, the design of the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander doesn’t stand out in a class that includes the more aggressively styled Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Still, the Mitsubishi’s look is clean and attractive, with a BMW-like character line down it flanks and an angular nose that hints of the Lexus NX SUV. Cool features include the electric windshield-wiper de-icer that helps keep ice and snow from building up on the wipers, while power-folding side mirrors and standard 18-inch wheels and tires add an upscale feel. The Outlander’s lack of a clumsy roof rack also adds to its sleek profile. The new Outlander PHEV is distinguished by distinctive badging and what looks like an additional fuel door on the right side that hides the charge port.
Favorite FeaturesFORWARD-COLLISION MITIGATION If this system determines a frontal collision with another car or pedestrian is imminent, it will warn the driver and automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the collision or avoid the impact all together. This system is optional on the SEL and GT trim levels.
 MULTI-VIEW CAMERA SYSTEM Mitsubishi offers a long list of active and passive safety systems on the new 2018 Outlander, including this smart system, which provides an overhead bird’s-eye view of the vehicle and its surrounds. The unique perspective shows you what’s behind the vehicle and makes parking the SUV a lot easier.
Standard FeaturesThe standard 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is available in five trims: ES, SE, LE, SEL and GT. The Outlander PHEV is offered in two trims: SEL and GT. Base ES models come with a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth, heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels. A better choice is the SE, which includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, dual USB ports, heated front seats and push-button start. We also recommend the LE model, which includes a sunroof and safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The SEL is the same price as the LE, and while it doesn’t have a sunroof, it does add an 8-way power driver’s seat, leather interior, power tailgate and auto-dimming rearview mirror. GT models include S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) and a V6 engine, a Rockford Fosgate audio system, auto on-off headlights, power-folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and paddle shifters. In addition to their advanced plug-in hybrid powertrain and all-wheel drive, the Outlander PHEV models include DC Quick Charging capability and, in the GT model, AC power outlets the rear seat and cargo areas to power electric devices.
Factory OptionsAmong the impressive options available in the 2018 Outlander are its forward-collision-mitigation system, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, three advanced safety features that can help prevent an accident. Thankfully, you don’t have to buy a pricier top-end GT model to obtain these features — they’re available in the SEL trim, bundled in the Touring Package. The $4,000 package also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof. All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels.ouring Package.

All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2018 Outlander ES, SE, LE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). The ES gets a simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi’s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular-grade gasoline and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine requires more expensive premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6. The Outlander PHEV plug-in hybrid electric vehicle uses a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and two electric motors. It’s a sophisticated system that enables you to run on electricity alone up to 22 miles, or by using the electrified powertrain in conjunction with the gasoline engine. With such a system, the gas engine automatically kicks on when the batteries are depleted. Total range slots in at 310 miles. Recharging the battery can take around 8 hours on a standard 120-volt outlet or roughly half that on a 240-volt line. Additionally, there’s DC Fast Charging that lets you charge to 80 percent capacity in 25 minutes. Don’t be fooled by the gasoline engine’s 117 horsepower rating — the combined gasoline/electric powertrain put out substantial torque figures. 2.4-liter inline-4166 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm162 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/30 mpg (FWD), 24/29 mpg (AWD) 3.0-liter V6 (GT)224 horsepower @ 6,250 rpm215 lb-ft of torque @ 3,750 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg

The hatchback body means practicality, and the updated styling is certainly eye-grabbing, and maybe even cool from some angles.","ConsDespite its aggressive appearance and ""SE"" trim level, there’s little that’s sporty about the Toyota Yaris. Take your performance dollars to the Ford Fiesta ST or even the turbocharged Chevy Sonic. Also note that the Honda Fit has better and more flexible cargo space thanks to its flip-and-fold rear seats.",16520,"Driving the Used 2018 Toyota YarisToyota’s Yaris offers a lot of things at its modest price tag, but driving passion isn’t one of them. With only 106 horsepower available it’s a slow ride to 60 mph, and neither the rubbery and vague 5-speed manual nor antiquated 4-speed automatic really help acceleration feel anything better than barely acceptable. Toyota has tuned the suspension for comfort, and it delivers a smooth-for-a-small-car ride. The Yaris SE is moderately better, with a slightly stiffer suspension, but without any additional power. That said, it’s fine for just put-putting around town, and it’s likely the sensible types attracted to the Yaris will be more thrilled with the parking-lot maneuverability afforded by the little Toyota’s diminutive size. However, note that competitors like the Chevy Spark and Honda Fit offer a CVT automatic or more gears, which improve both performance and fuel economy.
Interior ComfortToyota has worked hard to keep the Yaris from feeling cheap, and it is most evident inside. The door tops and other surfaces have a soft-touch finish, and the simple dash design cleanly integrates Toyota’s touch-screen infotainment. However, there are shortcomings. There’s no telescoping steering wheel available, making it hard to get comfortable. Rear-seat passengers are going to feel cramped, and that’s whether you pick the 3-door or 5-door Yaris. Behind the seats is some decent cargo space though, and the manually adjusting front seats are pretty comfortable.
Exterior StylingWhether you choose the 3-door or 5-door model, the 2018 Toyota Yaris has the same exterior dimensions, the primary distinction being the slightly sportier look of the 3-door. If you plan on using that rear seat frequently, the 5-door offers much better access. We like the new nose, and the way it gives the little Yaris an aggressive, bulldog-like look. But this is French bulldog, not English, and the squat proportions make it kinda cute. The SE adds a bit of visual pizazz like black trim and a rear spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesSAFETY SENSE-C TECHNOLOGY The Safety Sense-C suite of high-tech collision avoidance warns drivers of a frontal collision or if they’re drifting into the next lane. It can even automatically apply the brakes in an emergency. Impressive, especially considering it was just a few years ago that this tech was rare even on luxury cars.
 ENTUNE While the availability of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto has taken the bloom off the Entune rose, it’s nice to see that even the least expensive Yaris hatchback comes with the system’s 6.1-inch touch screen, USB port with iPod connectivity, Bluetooth hands-free phone compatibility and voice control. 
Standard FeaturesMost prominent among the standard features is the Toyota Safety Sense-C suite of active safety features, new last year. In addition, you get power windows and locks, air conditioning, and an infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touch screen, Entune, AM/FM/CD player, HD Radio, USB port and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. However, this is a base model of an already-cheap car, so the base model is missing power-mirror adjustments, cruise control and steering-wheel-mounted audio buttons, all standard on the LE model that also adds keyless entry and an automatic transmission. All models include ToyotaCare, which grants two years/25,000 miles of scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsIf you want more stuff in your Yaris, you have to climb the trim ladder. We mentioned what the LE adds; if you want all the things, you’ll have to step up to the SE. That brings along a ""sport-tuned"" suspension, LED daytime running lights, projector-beam headlights with LED accent bar, 16-inch alloy wheels, and interior and exterior accents. One quick pro tip: If you want a 5-door Yaris with a manual transmission, the SE is the only way to go. The SE also adds a larger touch screen (7.0 inch) and navigation.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s one engine for the 2018 Toyota Yaris: a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder that’s good for 106 horsepower. It sends this to the front wheels through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. That’s not a lot of power, and the transmissions’ gear count is low by today’s standards, but the Yaris holds its own around town. Out on the highway though it’s the Little Engine That Barely Can, and that goes double if you want to pass someone; instead, we suggest learning the power of patience. The clunky manual feels antiquated in its operation, too. Fuel economy is pretty good though, and the little engine goes just fine on regular-grade gasoline.
 1.5-liter inline-4 106 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 103 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/36 mpg (manual), 30/35 mpg (automatic)
Read Full Review","What's New?The 2018 Toyota Yaris gets a visual tune-up this year, with a more aggressive nose and tail. Inside, all Yaris models get SE-levels of interior trim. Note that the Yaris is a different car from the Yaris iA, which itself is a refugee from the now-defunct Scion brand.
The 2018 Toyota Yaris is the kind of no-frills econobox that, decades ago, established Toyota as a player in the U.S. But the definition of ""frills"" has changed, and with it our expectations of what modest dollars can buy. So the 2018 Yaris gets aggressively updated styling this year with a new nose and tail. Standard equipment includes collision warning, automatic braking and lane-departure warning, something that can’t be said of primary rivals the Honda Fit, Hyundai Accent, Ford Fiesta and Nissan Versa. Yet the Yaris still offers the kind of easy driving and low cost-of-ownership experience one expects from a Toyota, even a little bitty one. With two years of complimentary maintenance, strong resale value and overall practicality, the 2018 Yaris is a compelling subcompact choice.

Driving the Used 2018 Nissan AltimaFrom behind the wheel, the 2018 Nissan Altima is one of our favorite midsize sedans. It’s comfortable, with a smooth ride and a quiet interior, and it feels solid and substantial. Unlike some of its competition, the Altima is also engaging to drive with good steering feel and response, although the Ford Fusion and Mazda6 are still more fun to drive. The 2.5 SR trim improves the Altima’s handling, adding a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels and tires, but it still rides well. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is strong with 179 horsepower. It’s also refined and works well with the automatic transmission, although it can get a bit loud if you rev it past 5,000 rpm. The 270-horsepower V6 in the 3.5 SL model delivers excellent acceleration and passing power, although it’s still out-muscled by the 301-horsepower Toyota Camry XSE V6 and the turbocharged 325-horsepower Ford Fusion Sport.
Interior ComfortWhile not as roomy inside as a Honda Accord or Kia Optima, the 2018 Nissan Altima is a comfortable place for four adults, and its interior is both stylish and sophisticated. There’s plenty of room for five with good legroom in back, although headroom is snug in the rear if you’re over 6-feet tall. Up front the seats are comfortable for a variety of body shapes, whether outfitted in the standard cloth or optional leather. Visibility is excellent, and the placement of all controls is intuitive. The Altima’s spacious 15.4 cubic feet of trunk space is about average for the class, and a 60/40-split fold-down rear seat is standard.
Exterior StylingNissan’s new Altima bears a strong family resemblance to the rest of the company’s car line, with Nissan’s familiar V-shaped grille design and sleek headlight housing. Around back, the Altima’s rear sports an expressive bumper, and taillight housings that extend horizontally into the trunk door. The 2.5 SR variant is distinguished with a subtle integrated spoiler. All models feature a pair of chrome exhaust housings for an athletic vibe. Overall, we’ll call the Altima’s shape handsome and on the conservative end of the sedan spectrum. It may not pop as much as others, but the design should hold up well in the years ahead.
Favorite FeaturesSAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGY
For 2018, Automatic Emergency Braking is now standard on all Nissan Altimas. The system first warns the driver of a possible collision. If the driver does not act to avoid the accident, the system will apply the brakes for the driver. Intelligent Forward Collision Warning is also standard. Several other active-safety systems are also available, including Intelligent Cruise Control and Blind Spot Warning.
ACTIVE UNDERSTEER CONTROL
This system is standard on all 2018 Nissan Altimas. It improves both the performance and overall safety of the sedan by lightly braking the inside front wheels during cornering, which enhances traction and the sedan’s ability to turn. Its operation, in combination with the Altima’s traction-control and stability-control systems, is completely undetectable by the driver.
Standard FeaturesThe 2018 Nissan Altima is available in five trims, from the base 2.5 S to the top-line 3.5 SL. Spring for the least expensive and you’ll get an automatic transmission (optional on some rivals) and basic amenities like power doors, windows and air conditioning, along with push-button ignition, keyless entry and Bluetooth connectivity. The base audio system is a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary input but no USB port. We suggest spending the extra money to step up to the Altima 2.5 SR or 2.5 SV, which include a power driver’s seat and larger alloy wheels. Automatic Emergency Braking and Intelligent Forward Collision Warning are standard on all models.
Factory OptionsContinuing to climb through the Nissan Altima’s trim levels brings amenities like power front seats, leather interior, 17- or even 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power moonroof and LED headlights. Many extras are bundled into packages and vary by trim. Highlights include a navigation system with upgraded 7-inch touch screen, a cold-weather package with heated front seats and steering wheel, and technology packages with everything from blind-spot monitoring and dynamic cruise control to Cross Traffic Alert. Audio buffs can delight their ears with a 9-speaker Bose premium sound system. The top 3.5 SL model even includes rear air-conditioning vents and remote start.
Engine & TransmissionUnlike many rivals that offer hybrid, diesel and various turbocharged gasoline powerplants, the Altima keeps it simple with two offerings: a 4-cylinder in 2.5 models and a V6 in the 3.5. Both use a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Nissan’s 2.5-liter is made more efficient thanks to active grille shutters, revised engine compression ratio and less internal friction, all of which contribute to its nearly 40-mpg highway estimate. V6 models, meanwhile, still post a respectable 32 mpg, and both engines run just fine on regular unleaded to keep operating costs down.

And while the new warranty goes a long way in reducing the potential financial impact related to VW’s documented quality shortcomings, we wouldn’t bet on the new Tiguan being as trouble-free as a Honda CR-V, for instance.",26245,"Driving the Used 2018 Volkswagen TiguanThe Tiguan’s excellent steering and pedal response — expected attributes of any VW — contribute to an overall driving feel that’s among the best in the segment. Highway ride is firmer than that of some other small SUVs, but excellent seats, a quiet cabin and superior steering feel qualify the new Tiguan as an excellent long-haul companion. While the Tiguan’s turbocharged engine generates impressive horsepower and torque, a base Tiguan is a whopping 450 pounds heavier than a base Honda CR-V. City scooting and highway cruising are barely impacted, but the added mass is evident in highway merging and passing situations.
 Although the Tiguan is a bit longer than most compact SUVs, good outward visibility and a decent turning diameter combine to make it a breeze in parking lots. The Tiguan also offers a host of available technologies that make parking maneuvers even easier. Rear Traffic Alert with Braking will warn you of cars coming down the aisle you’re backing into, and can automatically stop the car if necessary. The Overhead View Camera provides a bird’s-eye view of the vehicle and its surroundings, an increasingly common feature that remains among our favorites. Park Distance Control with Maneuver Braking incorporates front and rear parking sensors that warn you of close objects and can even stop the car if you’re about to back into something.
Interior ComfortInterior design and materials are typical VW highlights, and the new Tiguan follows suit. We’re big fans of open bins with power and USB ports placed ahead of the transmission selector, a feature we were happy to find in the Tiguan. The start/stop button, electronic parking brake, and transmission selector are all placed within inches of each other in the center console, which makes for quicker and easier departures and arrivals. The center armrest is nicely padded but doesn’t offer the cool, ratcheting height adjustability we regularly put to use in other Volkswagens.
 In addition to accommodating backseat passengers with ample headroom and legroom, the 2018 VW Tiguan features sliding and reclining rear seatbacks that adjust to maximize both passenger comfort and cargo capacity. The seatback also features a 40/20/40 split, which makes it easier to carry long items and two rear passengers at the same time. The rear seat also features dedicated air vents, power and USB ports, plus a good armrest. Even though the Tiguan’s third row is the smallest on the market — with 3.5 fewer inches of legroom than even the Nissan Rogue’s available third row — it nevertheless can save you from driving two cars or making two trips or abandoning the idea altogether.
 Two-row Tiguan models offer 37.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row, a figure that places it in the top half of the segment. When your hands are full, you can open the Tiguan’s liftgate by gently kicking your foot under the rear bumper. And in a new twist, when you have a large load to remove from the Tiguan, first press a button on the open tailgate and it will automatically close when it senses you (the key) walking away from the vehicle.
Exterior StylingThe Tiguan’s distinctive and well-tailored look is sure to be among its bigger draws. Already the longest compact SUV in the segment, the Tiguan’s sharp creases add a taut, freshly pressed authority. Complex LED taillights give the rear view a similarly serious, semi-premium feel. The range-topping Tiguan SEL Premium adds LED headlights and LED daytime running lights, while the available R-Line package gives the Tiguan a sportier look that includes unique, larger wheels.
Favorite Features6-YEAR/72,000-MILE WARRANTY The best bumper-to-bumper warranty in the business, the Tiguan’s fully transferable coverage benefits owners who keep their cars a long time, as well as those who typically sell after a few years.

Factory OptionsIn addition to a range of active safety technologies and traditional upgrades like leather seats and premium audio, Tiguan option highlights include a panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, a bird’s-eye parking camera, keyless entry/start, a hands-free liftgate with walk-away close, and a 12.3-inch customizable digital instrument panel. As for VW’s Car-Net infotainment system, stepping up to the subscription-based Security & Service group adds capabilities like remote vehicle lock/unlock, automatic crash notification, and the parent-friendly Family Guardian with features including remote speed and boundary alerts. The range-topping Guide & Inform group includes built-in navigation plus the subscription-based SiriusXM Travel Link that includes traffic and weather info, plus local fuel prices, sports scores and movie information.
Engine & TransmissionThe Tiguan’s base curb weight of 3,777 pounds qualifies it as the heavyweight champion of the category. As such, its EPA fuel economy ratings are on the low side of the category average, but for most drivers it works out to just an extra gallon or two per month. The added mass also takes a toll on acceleration, even with 221 lb-ft of torque on tap from 1,600 rpm.
 The Tiguan’s available 4Motion all-wheel-drive system features a mechanical center differential and electronic differential locks, allowing it to transfer power front to back and side to side. The system also includes a variety of driver-selectable modes, including On-Road, Snow, Off-Road and Custom Off-Road. Within On-Road mode are four additional settings: Normal, Sport, Eco and Custom. Combined with 7.9 inches of ground clearance, a 4Motion-equipped Tiguan should deliver as much foul-weather and off-road capability and confidence as most anything in the segment.

The compact SUV segment has changed quite a bit in the nine years since Volkswagen introduced the Tiguan. And now, finally, the VW has caught up. Totally redesigned for 2018, the 2nd-generation Volkswagen Tiguan is among the roomiest SUVs in the segment and loaded with cutting-edge tech, including dual 12- and 8-inch digital displays, standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and a long list of driver-assist and safety technologies. It’s also the only compact SUV other than the Nissan Rogue to offer seating for seven, and boasts the very best bumper-to-bumper warranty in the segment: a 6-year/72,000-mile limited warranty that’s fully transferable to subsequent owners. The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan isn’t just a better SUV, it’s a smarter buy right out of the gate.

Buyers can choose from two engines, two cabs, two bed lengths and 2- or 4-wheel drive.","ConsThe Tacoma isn’t a fuel-sipper and doesn’t offer a diesel like the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon. Towing capacity isn’t best-in-class, either, and interior comfort lags behind the GMC and Chevy as well. And of course, if you have full-size loads or towing, then you need a full-size truck.",25000,"Driving the Used 2017 Toyota Tacoma Access CabThe V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission were new additions to the Tacoma when it was redesigned last year, and the combination offers more power, better fuel economy, and strong acceleration. While the Tacoma still uses drum brakes in the rear, the system works well, and we didn’t have a problem with performance. The Tacoma is also notably more comfortable around town, thanks to tweaks to the suspension and frame. The interior is notably quieter than past Tacomas, although not quite as serene as you’d find in the Chevy Colorado. In fact, the Colorado holds an edge in a few other areas; for example, power seats aren’t available on any Tacoma model, and despite the nicer interior in this newest version, the Colorado and GMC Canyon hold an edge here, too. However, the Tacoma blows them both away when the going gets rough, especially with the new TRD Pro model.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Tacoma interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats and everywhere else, and as is Toyota’s tradition, assembly quality is excellent. It gets push-button start and a moonroof, and the handy multi-information display between the main gauges displays fuel economy, outside temperature and even off-road info such as trail mode or angle of the Tacoma on a steep hill. The new Tacoma also comes with a new version of Entune, the connectivity and entertainment control center, and Qi wireless charging. However, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available on any model. Neither are power seats.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Tacoma is still obviously a midsize Toyota truck, but the styling draws from Toyota’s off-road racing history. There are other more modern cues as well, such as LED daytime running lights. The five separate models — SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Pro and Limited — each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. The composite-lined bed contains two useful storage bins, and its high walls mean it can carry plenty of cargo. The locking tailgate is damped for easier opening, and a 3-piece hard tonneau cover is a factory option.
Favorite FeaturesOFF-ROAD WIZARDRY
The 2017 Tacoma offers Crawl Control; put the truck in low range, set the system’s speed, and it automatically manages acceleration and braking so you can just focus on steering. The Multi-Terrain Select will automatically match the type of surface (snow, ruts, etc.) to the proper transmission, throttle and brake settings.
CLEVER STORAGE
It’s the little things, and we love the hidden spots underneath the back seats, perfect for stowing small items you’d rather keep out of view. The rear seats also fold flat for a handy cargo shelf, and since they’re covered in plastic, cleanup is a snap.
Standard FeaturesFor 2017 the Tacoma offers a rearview camera, a basic version of Entune connectivity, an automatic limited-slip differential, eight airbags, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and lockable tailgate as standard equipment. There are also 16-inch wheels and adjustable tie-down cleats in the bed. The standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder, powering the rear wheels. Interestingly, the Tacoma is decidedly old-school in some ways. It uses drum brakes in the rear, and discs aren’t available on any model. Same with power seats: not available, even in high-end models. On the other hand, the standard GoPro camera mount is as 21st century as it gets.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2017 Tacoma roughly divide into features that make it more rugged and tough, and those that bump up technology and refinement. There’s the TRD Pro trim level of course, but beyond that on the tough-truck side of the list are Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control, and a hard tonneau cover. On the technology side the Tacoma offers rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking assist, and blind-spot monitoring. Making life more comfortable is push-button start with Smart Key, Qi wireless charging, tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated leather seats, Entune with a full App suite, and a JBL sound system.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2017 Toyota Tacoma is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that’s been part of the Tacoma lineup pretty much forever. It powers the rear wheels (2WD) or all four wheels (4WD) through a 6-speed automatic; a 5-speed manual is available on 4WD models. But we suggest skipping it for the 3.5-liter V6. The bigger engine offers nearly 120 more horsepower (278 vs. 159) but gets nearly the same fuel economy and doesn’t cost much more. It’s also available with a 6-speed automatic, and 4WD models can opt for a 6-speed manual, too.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2017 Toyota Tacoma sees the return of the TRD Pro model, an off-road-ready version with extra gear to make the Tacoma even more capable when the going gets extremely tough. Other changes include a standard appearance package on SR5 V6 models.
The Toyota Tacoma continues to be the best-selling midsize truck in the U.S. by a wide margin, thanks to a decades-long reputation as a capable and reliable truck that’s as tough as nails. However, strong competitors like the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon have begun to eat into that dominance. Still, the Tacoma’s versatility, wide range of styles and prices, and attractive styling are a compelling argument for truck buyers who want something capable, not in a package that has its own Zip code. The 2017 Toyota Tacoma builds on its reputation for off-road ability with the reintroduction of the TRD Pro model, which adds serious off-road gear to the basic package, making it a realistic off-road alternative to the Jeep Wrangler.

The Panamera has a real back seat that can comfortably fit two adults, plus a nearly inexhaustible list of available technology and luxury features.","ConsDespite its ground-up reincarnation, the distinctive Panamera silhouette is still present. If you were not a fan of the original, the 2017 Porsche Panamera probably won’t change your mind. Those needing ample rear-seat headroom and a secure trunk should look to the Audi RS 7 or Mercedes-Benz AMG S65.",101000,"Driving the Used 2017 Porsche PanameraWhere the previous Panamera demonstrated good performance, ride and handling characteristics, the new 2017 Panamera Turbo makes the old car seem like a relic. The steering is crisp and precise, aided by a host of electronic upgrades in the optional Sport package that includes rear-wheel steering and launch control. Helping the Panamera round corners like any good Porsche is an air suspension and active torque vectoring. Power is routed to all four wheels, although a rear-drive model S model is rumored to arrive next year. Shifting is handled by a new 8-speed PDK automatic transmission, which may be Porsche’s best automatic to date and good enough to silence the “save-the-manuals” crowd. Performance from the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 is impressive to say the least. With 550 horsepower on tap, there is no shortage of neck-snapping passing power. But, even the 4S, with its 440-horsepower twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6, is no slouch.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Porsche Panamera features a revised interior filled with pleasing shapes and rich accents. The seats are amazingly comfortable, with multiple adjustments to help almost any driver find a comfortable position. More headroom is added in back where two 6-foot occupants can still find ample legroom. High-tech features abound, but the most noticeable is a massive navigation screen so clear it puts some HD TVs to shame. A large center tachometer is flanked by a configurable screen that can be optioned to include all manner of functions, from displaying road maps to an infrared image of the road ahead.
Exterior StylingPorsche’s Panamera sports sedan for 2017 shares not a single panel with the outgoing model, yet it is immediately recognizable. The hood and front fascia are squared up a bit, with stronger character lines to make the Panamera a bit more menacing. The familiar curved hatchback rear end is still in place, but the rear fenders are wider, as is the car itself. The 2017 Panamera is only about an inch longer than the 2016 car, but it looks bigger and more substantial. Familiar features like the LED headlights are here, as are new toys such as the 4-position adaptive rear spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesBURMESTER AUDIO Developed exclusively for Porsche, the Burmester 3D High End Surround Sound system is one of the best we’ve experienced. Two efficient amplifiers power 21 speakers, and control over the music can be achieved via multiple settings in the touch-screen controller. There’s even an option to focus the sound to a particular seat.
 4D CHASSIS CONTROL By monitoring the driving situation in all three spatial dimensions, Porsche’s 4D Chassis Control System is able to synchronize the many electronic suspension and chassis systems to deliver the optimal blend of ride comfort and performance.
Standard FeaturesFor the price, one would expect the 2017 Porsche Panamera 4S to come well equipped, and one would be correct. There’s a panoramic glass moonroof plus front and rear parking sensors, 19-inch wheels, 8-way-power adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, navigation and a 10-speaker premium audio system. The Turbo model adds LED headlights, 20-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, 14-speaker Bose audio, full leather interior, power-adjustable steering column, Alcantara roof lining, 14-way-power front seats and heated rear seats. Performance equipment includes Porsche Stability Management System (PSM) and the integrated 4D Chassis Control unit.
Factory OptionsThe list of possible option combinations is nearly limitless. Among the more notable upgrades are a 21-speaker Burmester audio system, rear-seat center-console touch screen, adaptive cruise control, adaptive LED headlights, Sport Package (air suspension, Sport Chrono package, rear-axle steering and sport exhaust), ceramic composite brakes, a heated steering wheel, 18-way-adaptive sport seats, ventilated front and rear seats, infrared night-vision camera, Lane Change Assist, Lane Keep Assist, massaging seats and 4-zone automatic climate control with separate air-temperature, blower-intensity and air-distribution adjustments for each seat. Porsche will also customize the Panamera’s interior to any color you like.
Engine & TransmissionFor now, there are two Panamera models and two engine choices. The 2017 Panamera 4S is powered by a 440-horsepower twin-turbocharged direct-injection 2.9-liter V6, while the 2017 Porsche Panamera Turbo receives a 550-horsepower twin-turbocharged direct-injection 4.0-liter V8 with cylinder deactivation. Both engines send power to all four wheels via a new PDK 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Porsche promises highway fuel-economy figures somewhere in the mid to upper 20s.

When Porsche first introduced the 4-door Panamera, a lot of Porsche purists were put off. The design was awkward and the handling was nowhere near that of other Porsche cars. Fast-forward to the all-new 2017 Porsche Panamera, and you’ll find a re-boot with crisper styling, better performance and all the right bits to create a 4-door Porsche even the most stubborn enthusiast would be proud to own. Easily the equal of the BMW M6 Gran Coupe and Audi RS 7, the new Panamera makes the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Maserati Quattroporte feel a bit outdated. With power ranging from 440 to 550 horsepower, Porsche’s Panamera 4S and Turbo for 2017 promise impressive performance with an equally impressive suspension, steering and brake setup to match.

First, there are those looking for green street cred, but who also don’t want to be scrambling for an outlet on a weekend road trip. Then there are those who simply want an affordable, good-looking, nice-driving, exceptionally fuel-efficient car.","ConsAbout the only downside to the 2017 Volt is the rear seat, which may have three seatbelts, but is still too tight for extended road trips.",34000,"Driving the Used 2017 Chevrolet VoltThe 2nd-generation Chevy Volt is better the moment you pull away from a stop. It’s quicker, thanks to the new engine and electric motor, but the steering and suspension blend to make the Volt genuinely fun to drive on a curving road. Bend it into a curve, and its flat stance and firm suspension combine with accurate steering to make it…fun. Yes, a fun EV. Even the brakes are satisfying, thanks in part to the lack of weirdness between mechanical and regenerative braking. The Volt takes advantage of regenerative braking with a paddle on the steering wheel that activates Regen On Demand. Hold it, and the electric motor’s regenerative braking is enhanced, slowing the car dramatically while helping to extend the battery’s life. Once you get the hang of it — and it doesn’t take long — you’ll find you hardly ever even need to use the actual brake pedal.
Interior ComfortChevrolet wisely ditched the too-high-tech capacitive buttons and Star Trek-inspired shiny white plastic for a more conventional interior. It was a smart move, and one that works beautifully, with a sensible layout that includes a great new touch-screen infotainment display. A multi-info display between the main gauges lets you use buttons on the steering wheel to monitor speed, battery use and myriad other functions. Front-seat room is fine, but the rear seat is still on the tight side for taller passengers, while the new fifth seating position is for short trips only.
Exterior StylingApparently, someone in Chevy design decided it would be a good idea for their flagship EV to NOT look dopey. Good call, we say, as the 2017 Volt is maybe the first alternative-fuel vehicle that people will buy simply because they fell in love with its appearance. While it retains the same general design theme — 5-door hatchback; metallic grille inserts; the lightning bolt through the ""V"" in Volt on the badge — its execution is spot-on. The proportions look excellent, the wide stance and narrow grille and headlights give it a distinctly sporty appearance.
Favorite Features53-MILE RANGE It’s not unusual for electric vehicles to fall short of their claimed battery-only range. But the Volt’s 53 miles is real-world proven. We managed to get 50 miles of EV range while cooking it on a famously twisty road north of San Francisco, just shy of its claimed range.
 APPLE CARPLAY Apple CarPlay brings the cleverly intuitive interface you love on your iPhone directly to the dash of your car. Just plug in your phone tap the CarPlay icon on the screen, and you have access to Siri, texts, maps, iTunes music and more. As those apps improve, so does CarPlay.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2017 Chevrolet Volt LT comes very nicely equipped from the get-go. There’s push-button start and remote start along with keyless entry, automatic climate control, and 4G LTE OnStar with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. That 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system is standard, as is Apple CarPlay. There’s a rearview camera, plus cruise control and a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel with multiple controls for the various audio and infotainment systems. Standard safety equipment counts multiple airbags, including a knee airbag to prevent sliding under the steering wheel in a collision.
Factory OptionsLeather seats and a Bose audio system are both optional in the Volt LT, meaning if you want those features you don’t have to make the stretch to the more expensive Volt Premier model. If you do, though, not only are those features included, but you also can order Chevrolet’s Driver Confidence Package, which includes lane-keeping assist, low-speed automatic braking, and lets you order adaptive cruise control. The Premier is the only model that offers navigation as well, at a surprisingly affordable $495.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one drivetrain for the 2017 Chevrolet Volt, consisting of two parts. There’s the range-extending 4-cylinder gasoline engine, which displaces 1.5 liters and puts out 101 horsepower. But it’s a generator, there to supply electricity to the electric motor when the 18.4-kWh battery runs out of juice after about 50 miles. Actual motivation for the Volt is thanks to a pair of electric motors with an output of 149 horsepower. A 50-mile range may not sound like much, but Chevrolet notes that about 90 percent of car trips fall within that range, plus the Volt can go up to 420 miles before refueling with regular unleaded. A full recharge takes about 4.5 hours on a 240-volt charger or roughly 13 hours on a standard 120-volt plug.

For 2017 Chevrolet’s Volt improves upon the 1st-generation car in a number of ways. It has better all-electric range, with 53 miles on battery power easily attainable. It can go a total of 420 miles thanks to a more fuel-efficient engine. But beyond efficiency, it’s just a better car, period. It’s fun to drive, with a nicely sorted suspension, good steering and decent power from its unique drivetrain. The interior is both more conventional and more high-tech than before, thanks to the use of real buttons combined with features like Apple CarPlay. It can even seat five people, at least for short drives, and it looks great. The price is also spot-on with the Toyota Prius, after you deduct for federal and state EV credits.

What's New?For 2017, the BMW 2 Series coupe and convertible receive all-new models and new, more powerful turbocharged engines. The 230i variants get an updated version of BMW’s spectacular 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. It now makes 248 horsepower. And the M240i models use an all-new 3.0-liter inline-6 that’s just sublime and produces 335 horsepower.
The 2017 BMW 2 Series is the smallest and most affordable 2-door coupe or convertible in the luxury brand’s lineup. This entry-level Bimmer delivers all the modern conveniences of the 4 Series in a smaller, more affordable package. It competes against the Audi A3 sedan and convertible and the Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan. The 2 Series coupe and convertible are each offered in 230i and M240i models, both with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The 230i variants get a spectacular 248-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and the M240i models use a sublime 335-horsepower 3.0-liter 6-cylinder. A 6-speed manual transmission is available on rear-wheel-drive models. All-wheel-drive models get the 8-speed automatic only. And for true high-performance enthusiasts, there’s the rear-wheel-drive 365-horsepower M2.
Used 2017 BMW 2 Series PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2017 BMW 230i starts reasonably, right around $34,000 including the $995 destination charge. The 2017 BMW M240i Coupe starts around $45,500. AWD on either model costs an extra $2,000. Order all the options, and you’ll wind up with a 230i and M240i costing about $50,000 and $55,000, respectively. Convertible models add about $5,500 to the price of a 230i coupe, or about $4,600 to the price of an M240i. The Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA start a grand or two lower. The less refined Acura ILX starts even lower, around $29,000, but you lose performance and cachet in the bargain. Check out Kelley Blue Book’s Fair Purchase Price Tool before heading to the dealership. We expect the 2017 BMW 2 Series coupe to retain slightly above-average residual values, better than the Acura ILX, on par with the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA.
Driving the Used 2017 BMW 2 SeriesSmall, light and tossable, the 2017 BMW 2 Series is a true driver’s car, reminiscent of the great rear-wheel-drive sports coupes that built the brand’s reputation for performance, cars like the 2002ti and 318ti. From behind the wheel, the 230i and M240i are smile-makers, with power to spare and enough agility to satisfy any car lover. And for true high-performance enthusiasts, there’s the 365-horsepower M2. In all cases, BMW combines the 2 Series’ natural athleticism with high levels of quality and refinement, and the result is a very enjoyable car to drive. The 2 Series’ tidy dimensions and tight turning radius also make it an easy car to live with in the city. And it’s fuel-efficient. Despite its potent output, the 230i with the automatic transmission is rated at an impressive 35-mpg highway. In real-world testing we even exceeded that figure by nearly four mpg.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 BMW 2 Series has seating for four, but its rear seats are best used for very small people or extra storage. Materials are high quality, and the interior’s fit and finish are impressive. BMW interiors are never overly ornate, and the interior of the new BMW 2 Series is simple and elegant. Seat comfort is exceptional as is the driving position. The gauges are clear and concise. Above the center dash sits a high-res color screen that displays navigation, audio and other info. It’s controlled by BMW’s now familiar iDrive rotary dial below the gearshift.
Exterior StylingAlthough we wouldn’t call it the prettiest BMW, we like the muscular proportions of BMW’s 2017 2 Series. This is a very attractive little 2-door, with an aggressive stance, dramatically swept headlights, BMW’s now-signature L-shaped taillights, and a beautifully tapered roofline. Befitting the ""M"" designation, the M240i dials up the visual muscularity to back up its additional performance. It boasts a deeper front spoiler, larger air intakes, contoured rocker panels, and a unique rear lower valance. Like most drop-tops, the convertibles look better top-down. Both offer 13.8 cubic feet of trunk space, marginally better than the Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Acura rivals.
Favorite FeaturesTURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER BMW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter is one of the best 4-cylinder engines on the planet. It’s smooth and powerful, with 248 horsepower on tap for 0-60-mph blasts under six seconds, and efficient with a fuel-economy rating that reaches 35 mpg on the highway. It’s the best of both worlds.
PARKING ASSISTANT If parallel parking ranks up there with death and the dentist, BMW’s optional Parking Assistant, which is available on the new 2 Series, is for you. Find an open spot, activate the system and it automatically steers the 2 Series into the space, while you operate the accelerator, gears and brakes.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2017 BMW 230i coupe and convertible come standard with 8-way manually adjustable front seats, sport front seats, a 60/40-split rear seat, a 10-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch display and HD Radio, keyless push-button start, a tilt/telescopic steering wheel, rain-sensing windshield wipers and 17-inch wheels with all-season tires. The standard powertrain is a spectacular 248-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder backed by an 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters, auto start/stop and rear-wheel drive. The 4-year/50,000-mile warranty is also standard, as is BMW Ultimate Care, which includes free scheduled maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is available on all models, as well as a Track Handling Package. The Handling package lowers the car by 10 mm, includes Adaptive M suspension with Comfort and Sport settings, variable sport steering, larger M Sport brakes and high-performance tires. At $2,300 for the 230i coupe without the M Sport packages it’s a very good deal. Other options include a highly recommended Driver Assistance package that bundles together a rearview camera with active guidelines and front and rear parking sensors, and a Cold Weather Package that includes heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 BMW 230i gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine putting out 248 horsepower, and routing it to the rear or all four wheels (RWD, AWD) through either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The M240i uses a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6, boasting 335 horsepower and also available with the same drivetrain options. To help improve fuel economy in the city, all 230i models include an auto-stop/start function that shuts off the engine at complete stops. And its 248 horsepower gives it the title of the most powerful base model in its class. In fact, its excellent performance will make you question whether the 80 extra horsepower you get in the M240i is worth the money.
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (230i) 248 horsepower @ 5,200 rpm 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,450 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/35 mpg (automatic, RWD), 21/32 mpg (manual, RWD), 24/33 mpg (automatic, AWD), 23/34 mpg (convertible, RWD), 23/33 mpg (convertible, AWD)

Even with the SE model’s manual transmission the Corolla isn’t particularly fun to drive.",20000,"The 2017 Toyota Corolla is destined to remain a best-seller, thanks to new styling, a simplified model lineup, improved interior, and a host of standard safety equipment that’s unheard of in this class, or even in cars costing much more. It all adds up to a tremendous value, and while the Corolla hasn’t been equated with excitement for decades, its reliability, low price and predictable driving dynamics keep it not just competitive, but a leader in the compact-sedan market. Okay, it’s not as fun to drive as the Mazda3, Ford Focus or even longtime rival Honda Civic. But the Corolla costs less, is exceptionally roomy front and rear, and its 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine makes up in fuel economy what it lacks in horsepower.
Used 2017 Toyota Corolla PricingPrices go up on the 2017 Toyota Corolla, with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $19,400 for a base Corolla L. That’s about $1,300 more than last year, but the new Corolla comes with a lot more stuff, including the TSS-P safety package and the standard CVT automatic. On the other end of the scale is the Corolla XSE, which comes in fully loaded at just above the $24,000 mark. That’s a pretty good bargain on both ends; on the low end, the Civic LX with the Honda Sensing package comes closest, but still runs about $1,000 more. On the high side, a loaded Corolla is notably less than many competitors. Check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their new Corolla. As for resale value, the Corolla outpaces virtually everything but the Civic, where the two run neck-and-neck.
Driving the Used 2017 Toyota CorollaEnthusiasts won’t find much to like about the 2017 Toyota Corolla, but remove that sliver of the buying populace and you have a car that’s inarguably one of the most popular vehicles ever made. It’s comfortable, with a ride quality that absorbs bumps without making the car feel like it’s wallowing around. The SE models even have the tiniest bit of bite to their suspension, and the manual-transmission SE could even be considered beginner-level fun. The 1.8-liter 4-cylinder favors fuel economy over acceleration, but at least now it’s paired with the continuously variable automatic transmission in all models — 6-speed manual notwithstanding — which makes the most of the engine’s meager output for respectable acceleration and passing, as long as you’re willing to let it rev. At full throttle it gets noisy inside but the rest of the time the Corolla is certainly quiet enough for day-to-day living.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Toyota Corolla interior may be short on pizazz, but it’s quiet, comfortable, gets the job done. This year there’s a new dash design with round air vents, a new climate-control interface, a new infotainment system, improved and more legible gauges, and a multi-information display. Yet with the upgrades, Toyota smartly left the good stuff alone. The front seats are comfortable and supportive, and the rear seats are surprisingly roomy, even for tall passengers. Even with the new features everything is easy to use and see, and there’s good cargo space with split-folding rear seatbacks to help with longer objects.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Corolla offers two different exterior designs, reflecting the new model lineup. The L, LE, XLE and LE Eco offer a nose-and-tail treatment that’s distinct from the sportier SE, XSE and 50th Anniversary models. Yet both offer similarities. There are standard LED headlights, with a 2-element version on the SE-type Corollas. The SE-based models also get vertically styled front vents and LED fog lights, plus all-red taillights, while LE-type models use subtle cues, such as 2-color taillights, to look a little more upscale. The 50th Anniversary model comes in a particularly fetching Black Cherry paint with 17-inch alloy wheels.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE-PAdaptive cruise control, pre-collision with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams. Features like these are usually optional, if they’re even available at all. Yet they’re all standard on the 2017 Corolla, even on the base model.
INTERIOR UPDATEFor 2017 the Corolla also gets a nice update to the interior, expanding the use of soft-touch plastics, upgrading the look of various components, and overall just generating a nicer feel for an interior that was already roomy and comfortable.
Standard FeaturesWe’ve already mentioned the array of active safety systems now standard on even the base 2017 Toyota Corolla L. Beyond that the Corolla L offers LED headlights, a rearview camera with path projection, air conditioning, cruise control, and tilt-telescope steering with audio and Bluetooth controls on the spokes. There’s a USB port for phone recharging and audio integration, and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display audio system that includes Toyota’s Entune multimedia bundle and Siri Eyes Free, although Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available at all. The 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat and the rest of the interior are upholstered in comfortable cloth.
Factory OptionsCorolla LE models get automatic climate control, a multi-information display (MID) between the gauges, and nicer interior trim. The XLE and XSE get faux-leather seating surfaces and an 8-way-power driver’s seat, nicer instrumentation with a color MID, and push-button start and keyless entry. If you want a ""sporty"" Corolla, the SE can be equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission. SE models are generally equipped a little better than LE models, offering a color MID among other things. XLE, XSE, SE manual and 50th Anniversary edition Corollas get a standard 7-inch infotainment system, which can be upgraded with an integrated navigation system.
Engine & TransmissionThere are two versions of the same 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine for the 2017 Toyota Corolla. The one used in nearly all models offers 132 horsepower, routing it through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), or in the case of the SE, an available 6-speed manual transmission. The Corolla LE Eco offers a 140-horsepower version of the same engine, but it’s no hot rod, instead being tuned for better fuel economy. Fuel economy is good, especially the Eco getting up to 40 mpg on the highway, but these days that’s par for the course instead of class-leading. Some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy numbers due to changes in EPA testing.
 1.8-liter inline-4 (L, LE and S) 132 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 128 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/35 mpg (SE 6-speed manual), 28/36 mpg (CVT, 16-inch wheels), 28/35 mpg (CVT, 17-inch wheels)

If loud styling isn’t your thing, we think the Silverado’s tasteful exterior will likely hold strong appeal.","ConsIf you’re seeking untraditional features in a traditional pickup, Ford’s aluminum body F-150 is lighter and more fuel-efficient than the Silverado, while the Ram 1500 and Nissan Titan offer the option of a diesel engine. Chevy’s smaller midsize Colorado can haul nearly as much cargo and offers a diesel engine.",28000,"Driving the Used 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabDespite its boxy design, there is an eerie lack of wind and road noise when driving the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup, a testament to just how far GM’s suspension and body engineering technologies have come. Over big dips, the suspension does an admirable job soaking up impacts, although this same ability translates into a sometime soft and bouncy ride when traveling off-road. The Silverado’s steering feel is perfectly weighted, making for precise cornering and ease of use when negotiating crowed parking lots. The Silverado’s standard V6 offers good fuel economy but feels sluggish. We prefer either the 5.3- or 6.2-liter V8, although the latter’s poor fuel economy makes the 5.3-liter engine the best fit. GM’s excellent 8-speed automatic transmission delivers smooth operation and helps the Silverado achieve fuel economy on par with the F-150’s EcoBoost V6. We only wish it offered better response to throttle input.
Interior ComfortEven more basic models of the 2017 Chevy Silverado benefit from the sensible layout and ample storage, and the plastics are nicely textured and feel upscale. Of course, if you opt for higher-end models, you get higher-end materials, with the High Country models laying on the luxury nice and thick. There are three cab styles, with passenger capacity ranging from three in regular cabs to up to six in double-cab or crew-cab configurations. With up to five USB plugs, two 12-volt ports and a 110-volt outlet, the Silverado can juice several devices.
Exterior StylingChevy’s full-size Silverado pickup’s exterior styling is rugged and distinctive without going overboard. The 2017 Silverado features a bold, aggressive grille that changes design from trim level to trim level. The LTZ gets an especially chromed-up look, while the standard Silverado sports a more subdued look. Missing from the Silverado body are helpful step-up tools, such as the Ford F-150’s built-in tailgate stepladder, although like the Nissan Titan, the Silverado does offer an optional rear-bumper step assist.
Favorite Features12,500-POUND TRAILERING RATING
On the Crew Cab models, a 12,500-pound trailering rating places the Silverado at the head of its class, with the Tundra limited to 9,500 pounds and the F-150 at a close 11,900 pounds.
APPLE CARPLAY
Even pickup owners want the latest and greatest in infotainment, which is why the availability of Apple CarPlay in the 2017 Chevy Silverado makes so much sense. With CarPlay, owners can integrate their Apple smartphones, making many of the apps and features available via the truck’s touch screen.
Standard FeaturesStarting at the lowest-end 2017 Silverado WT, you get the basics, such as air conditioning, power windows, cruise control and AM/FM audio system with 4.2-inch display and inputs for USB, Teen Driver safe-driving system, auxiliary jack and SD card. It also includes the Silverado’s new projector-beam headlights and LED accents, and the CornerStep cutout on the rear bumper to make it easier to access the truck’s bed. Safety equipment includes front, side and curtain airbags, anti-lock brakes and stability control. All 2017 Chevrolet Silverados also include two years/24,000 miles of complimentary factory-scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsAside from picking either a 5.3-liter or 6.2-liter V8 engine over the standard 4.3-liter V6 for your 2017 Silverado, there are an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic, rear- or 4-wheel drive, and bed and cabin size to consider. Luxury-truck buyers should start with the High Country, with its big V8, leather upholstery, navigation, Apple CarPlay, a premium audio system, and more. CarPlay is also available in the nicely equipped LT and LTZ models. One option that isn’t available at any price is push-button ignition, odd since it’s available in the Silverado-based Tahoe SUV.
Engine & TransmissionThe three engines for the 2017 Chevy Silverado remain the same. There’s the base 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6, while the 5.3-liter V8 powers higher trims, with the High Country getting a 6.2-liter V8 with up to 12,500 pounds of towing power. All engines are available with 4-wheel drive (4WD) instead of the standard 2-wheel-drive (2WD) setup. Standard on the V6 and 5.3-liter V8 is a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2-liter V8 and 5.3-liter V8 LTZ models get an 8-speed automatic. All three of the engines run on regular unleaded, and the V6 and 5.3-liter V8 are flex-fuel compliant, meaning they can use the E85 ethanol blend.

The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup finds itself in a styling and power war not only with rivals like the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500, but Nissan’s new Titan and Toyota’s Tundra. Even with its recent styling upgrades, the Silverado’s look remains tastefully conservative, which for many truck buyers is a good thing. For these folks, the measure of a pickup’s value is in how much it can haul, tow and carry. Chevrolet’s Silverado has a higher trailering rating than the Tundra, and a host of new safety features to challenge the F-150. Unlike the Ram and Titan, the Silverado doesn’t offer the option of diesel engine, but its choice of three powerful gasoline engines helps keep the price down without sacrificing power or capability.

With its available diesel engine, fuel economy is remarkably good, and the new ZR2 may just be the off-road enthusiast’s dream.","ConsThe Colorado is a smaller truck, so if you need to tow more than 7,700 pounds, need additional interior space, or just want more capability than a small truck can offer, you’re better off with a full-sized one.",21000,"Driving the Used 2017 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabSuffice it to say, we love the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel that’s available in the 2017 Chevrolet Colorado. It’s quiet, smooth and refined, with excellent power delivery, and there’s just enough diesel soundtrack to remind that you have something under the hood that you can’t get in a Toyota. But there’s also a new V6 engine this year, now with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The V6 is a truck-tuned version of the V6 that’s available in various Cadillac models, as is the transmission, and the combination promises more power and torque and better refinement than its predecessor. The biggest news will be the ZR2, an extensively reworked version of the Colorado ready for tackling dunes, rocks, trails and whatever else an ambitious driver can think of. With shocks by renowned race-car supplier Multimatic and increased ride height, our brief test ride showed that the ZR2 is ready for just about anything.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Colorado walks a delicate line. On one hand, it needs to appeal to those who might otherwise be interested in an SUV, so it’s comfortable and quiet, with front seats, controls, and a rear seat in Crew Cab models that are all easy to live with. It even comes with premium features like heated seats, Apple CarPlay, and an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system. Yet it maintains the expected ruggedness of a truck, with tough-feeling plastics, comfortable but durable seat upholstery, and touches like the foldable rear seat. ZR2 models get a unique set of switches for various differential locks.
Exterior StylingThe more we see of the Chevy Colorado, the more we like it. It does nothing to mask its midsize-pickup style, but it holds back from rubbing your nose in faux-ruggedness, with curves and lines that are softened compared to the Toyota Tacoma. Even the new ZR2’s visual modifications are for function rather than form, so the increased wheel arches, modified bumpers and hood scoop are all functional components. The standard CornerStep rear bumper makes it easy to get into the bed, and we suggest getting the EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate, which lets you open and close the tailgate with one hand.
Favorite FeaturesDURAMAX DIESEL The Chevrolet Colorado is the only midsize truck available with a diesel engine (GMC Canyon notwithstanding), and the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel is a gem. Smooth and powerful, it offers up an excellent driving experience and superior fuel economy to anything else in the market.
 COLORADO ZR2 While we haven’t had a chance to tackle trails in the ZR2 just yet, we’re excited at the prospect of this truck. Chevrolet pulled no punches with the Colorado ZR2, adding serious off-road equipment like Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and a whole lot more. 
Standard FeaturesSure, you can buy the base model 2017 Colorado with its 2.5-liter gasoline-burning 4-cylinder engine, and still get the utility-enhancing CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate and cargo-box lighting, air conditioning, a 4.2-inch touch-screen audio system with USB, and power windows. But unless you’re replenishing your pizza-delivery fleet, you’ll more likely start at the LT model, which includes an 8-inch touch-screen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an enhanced multicolor information display between the gauges, nicer wheels and interior trim, three months of Sirius satellite radio, cruise control and OnStar.
Factory OptionsThere are two upgrade engines available for the 2017 Chevy Colorado: the new 3.6-liter V6 or the Duramax diesel, and 4-wheel drive with a low-speed transfer case is also available. Like many trucks, there’s your choice of extended- or crew-cab body, plus a standard length or long bed. Available features include a spray-on bedliner, fog lights, cross rails for the cargo-box storage system and a locking rear differential. The Z71 model offers specialized suspension, differential, and underbody shields for off-road capability. If that’s not enough, in the spring the ZR2 promises to exponentially expand that envelope.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard engine in the Colorado is the 200-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, which is fine, but you’ll most likely want to spring for the new 308-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 or the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel 4-cylinder with its 369 lb-ft of torque. The new V6 also comes with a new 8-speed automatic transmission, the only 8-speed in the midsize-pickup truck market (save for the mechanically similar GMC Canyon); the other two engines come with a 6-speed automatic, or a 6-speed manual in the case of the base-model Colorado. Two-wheel drive (2WD) is standard, and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optional with all engines. Fuel economy ranges all the way up to 30 mpg with the diesel.

The ZR2 is for off-road enthusiasts who want the highest-tech equipment they can get from the factory.
Last year it was a new diesel. This year, the 2017 Chevrolet Colorado gets a new V6 engine mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission. The combination adds a bit of horsepower and torque, but thanks to the new transmission, there’s no fuel-economy penalty. Also new this year is the Colorado ZR2, a specialized model featuring off-road gear that the most die-hard Baja 1000 watcher will love. It all combines with the Chevy Colorado’s existing strengths: an available diesel engine that gets up to 30 mpg; Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; a comfortable and quiet interior, and much more. The changes all help ensure that the 2017 Colorado gives no ground against its biggest rival: the segment-leading Toyota Tacoma.

Those needing ample cargo space might be happier with a Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-5 or even the larger Jeep Cherokee.",20000,"Driving the Used 2017 Jeep RenegadeIn stark contrast to the rugged Jeep Wrangler, the 2017 Jeep Renegade compact SUV delivers a more civilized ride, better handling and a quieter cabin. The base 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder is no powerhouse, but it is a willing participant and sounds much happier at high rpm than the optional 2.4-liter engine. Sadly, the turbo is available only with the 6-speed manual so if you want an automatic or need the ability to tow, the 2.4-liter Tigershark is your only choice. While more powerful than the base engine, the Tigershark feels a bit crude. It’s loud at high speeds and the accompanying 9-speed transmission can sometimes have a hard time finding and holding the right gear. Opt for the Trailhawk trim and you’ll get Jeep’s Active Drive Low with 20:1 rock-crawl mode, better approach and departure angles, 19 inches of water-fording capability, and 8.7 inches of ground clearance.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Renegade’s 5-passenger interior is more spacious than you might think. The secret is the Renegade’s shape. Its blocky design yields good legroom in both rows, plus 18.5 cubic feet of storage capacity behind the rear seats. That expands to over 50 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, and in all but base models, the front-passenger seat folds to accommodate longer items like surfboards. The driver’s position is high and comfortable, with a good view out. Sprinkled throughout are details like a map inlay in the front storage bin and the impression of mud splatter on the tachometer.
Exterior StylingOne of the best things about the 2017 Jeep Renegade is that it looks like a Jeep. Present are the traditional 7-slotted vertical grille and round headlights, but it’s the Renegade’s angles that tie its design with that of the iconic Wrangler and, long before that, the Willys MB. At the same time, the Renegade is its own modern take on what a Jeep can be. Optional and recommendable are the My Sky removable roof panels, which truly bring the outside in. Trailhawk models are beefed up with 8.7 inches of ground clearance, skidplates and red tow hooks front and rear.
Favorite FeaturesTRAILHAWK VERSIONA vehicle can’t wear the Jeep name if it can’t at least tackle modest off-road trails and terrain. The 2017 Jeep Renegade is pretty good off-road, but the Trailhawk version enhances its ability with more ground clearance, protective skidplates, all-terrain tires and an advanced 4WD system.
SAFETY FEATURESUnique for an entry-level compact SUV, the 2017 Jeep Renegade offers a host of advanced driver-assist technologies including lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitor and Jeep’s Forward Collision Warning-Plus, which applies the brakes and can even stop the vehicle in the event of an eminent collision.
Standard FeaturesJeep’s Renegade for 2017 comes in four trims: Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk. The base model’s roughly $20,000 starting price is tempting and grants immediate access to the Jeep brand, but is rather light on content with simpler features like an AM/FM radio with USB input, 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat, power windows and door locks, and 16-inch wheels. Most glaring is its lack of standard air conditioning and Bluetooth connectivity. We recommend stepping up even one trim level to Latitude, which brings those two basic features along with a 5-inch Uconnect touch-screen infotainment system, rearview camera and fog lights.
Factory OptionsFour-wheel drive is optional on all models except Trailhawk, where it’s standard. If you want an automatic transmission, you’ll have to opt for the larger, 2.4-liter engine. It’s standard on Limited and Trailhawk models, optional on all others. Other options that vary by trim include blind-spot monitoring and lane-departure warning, leather seats, navigation, heated seats and steering wheel, 506-watt Beats audio with nine speakers, the My Sky removable roof system, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control and rear park-assist. Four-wheel-drive models have a terrain-select system that optimizes the Jeep’s traction for settings like snow, sand, mud and — on Trailhawk models — rocks.
Engine & TransmissionTwo 4-cylinder engines are available for the 2017 Jeep Renegade. Sport and Latitude models come with a turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, while the larger 2.4-liter is optional on those models and standard on Limited and Trailhawk variants. Which engine you choose may rest on the transmission you want. The 1.4-liter is available only with a 6-speed manual, while the 2.4-liter only comes with a 9-speed automatic. Both can be had with 4WD instead of the standard 2WD (front-wheel drive). The 6-speed manual transmission is easy to use, and the 9-speed models we tested were more refined than those used in earlier Chrysler vehicles. The Jeep Renegade can tow up to 2,000 pounds with the 2.4-liter engine and 4WD. Towing is not recommended for 1.4-liter models.
 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 (6-speed manual) 160 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm 184 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-4,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/31 mpg (2WD), 24/31 mpg (4WD)
 2.4-liter inline-4 (9-speed automatic) 180 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm 175 lb-ft of torque @ 3,900 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/31 mpg (2WD), 21/29 mpg (4WD)
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions. 
Read Full Review","What's New?Jeep’s 2017 Renegade compact SUV gains Keyless Go on all trims, while the Limited gains standard passive entry. HID headlights and automatic high beams are added to the Advanced Safety package.
Riding on the same platform as the Fiat 500X, the 2017 Jeep Renegade shares little else with its Italian stablemate. With ample ground clearance, an advanced 4-wheel-drive system (4WD) and big dose of Jeep styling, the Renegade is all Jeep, larger inside than the Mazda CX-3 and more off-road capable than the Honda HR-V. A choice of turbocharged or normally aspirated engines gives the Renegade an advantage over other small-crossover SUVs, and nobody makes anything comparable to the trail-rated Trailhawk. The Renegade’s most appealing quality, however, is the enormous number of trims, features and variations, allowing customers to create a personalized Renegade that best suits their needs. Even the manual models can be fitted with options such as a heated steering wheel and navigation.

The SEL starts around $32,700, the Titanium model bows around $36,500, and the top-line Sport starts near $41,300. Adding AWD to any variant — except Sport where it’s standard — costs around $1,500. Fully loaded, an Edge Sport can pass $47,000. At these prices, the Edge nearly mimics its closest competitor, the 2017 Nissan Murano. The Edge is also in line with the Jeep Grand Cherokee and a 6-cylinder Subaru Outback. A less expensive 5-passenger SUV is the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, though it’s available only in 4-cylinder form. A pricier alternative is the VW Touareg. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Edge. We expect the Edge to hold average resale value, lower than the Jeep Grand Cherokee and much lower than the Subaru Outback.
Driving the Used 2017 Ford EdgeThe 2017 Ford Edge has an impressive balance of power, refinement and — at least with the base engine — efficiency. There’s actually very little ""base"" about the standard engine, a mighty 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that grunts out 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Working with the Edge’s standard 6-speed automatic transmission, this powertrain will more than satisfy most buyers. A naturally aspirated V6 is available, while those desiring serious punch can opt for Ford’s 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 exclusive to the Edge Sport. That top model also has a sport-tuned suspension for better handling — but with a stiffer ride compared with the rest of the Edge lineup, which is otherwise impressively comfortable and quiet. Note that the 2017 Edge with the 2.0-liter engine and front-wheel drive (FWD) has engine start/stop technology that cuts power at idle to save fuel. The system can be deactivated with the press of a button.
Interior ComfortThe Ford Edge has a 2-row, 5-passenger layout that has generous space for both people and cargo. The Edge’s large exterior and form-fitting seats yield impressive legroom for both front and rear passengers, with the rear seats offering a commendable 40.6 inches. Cargo capacity is 39.2 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 73.4 with them folded. The cabin has a fresh, premium design. Ford has moved away from adaptive-touch controls, equipping the Edge with hard buttons for audio and climate controls. As we mention above, the revamped Sync 3 is a vast improvement over the past MyFord Touch.
Exterior StylingThe Ford Edge has a wide, squat profile. That translates to a roomy interior, but beware this Ford’s wide dimensions when pulling into a garage — especially those with one bay. Ford Edge styling is conservative yet strong, starting with a large trapezoidal grille and ending with a sloped rear and wraparound lights that bring cohesion. Sport models stand apart with their piano-black grille treatment, unique headlights, body-color front and rear fascias, and body-color lower cladding. They can also be spotted from behind by their pair of trapezoidal exhaust housings instead of the circular bright tips of those on the other trims.
Favorite Features2.7-LITER ECOBOOST V6 ENGINEThis potent powerplant makes the Edge a real sleeper, not to mention the best-handling version available thanks to a stiffer suspension. The Sport Edge also comes standard with all-wheel drive, which offers better grip and negates the worry of torque steer under hard acceleration.
SYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMFord’s touch-screen audio and information system improves with each year, and the latest version is the best yet. For 2017, Sync 3 gets a significant update for smartphone users: compatibility with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Sync 3 is standard on Titanium and Sport models, optional on the SEL.
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Ford Edge comes in four trims: SE, SEL, Titanium and Sport. Spend the least on a base SE and you’ll still get a high-tech turbocharged engine, keyless entry and push-button start, rearview camera, cloth seats with 6-way-manual driver’s adjustment, and 18-inch wheels. Infotainment is brought to you by a basic Sync system with 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity. If your budget can budge another $3,000, you’re better off with an SEL model that adds power driver and passenger seats, reverse-parking aid, dual-zone climate control, EasyFold remote rear-seat release and satellite radio.
Factory OptionsOptions abound, running the gamut from pragmatic to the entertaining. Of the former, all-wheel drive can be had for better traction. Other features include navigation, a forward-facing camera to aid in parking, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision and lane-keeping warning systems, and inflatable rear safety belts. A parking-assist system is also available. The high-end, leather-clad Titanium and Sport models offer Ford’s adaptive steering system, which varies response based on speed, and the hands-free liftgate feature that you’ll appreciate every time your hands are lugging groceries. Other amenities include heated/ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, panoramic roof and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionYou have a choice of three engines in the 2017 Ford Edge. Standard on SE, SEL and Titanium models is a 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder. In addition to powering the standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) models, the small but potent powerplant is offered with all-wheel drive (AWD). Optional on SEL and Titanium models is a 3.5-liter V6. Top-line Sport models come with the most powerful engine, a 315-horsepower 2.7-liter EcoBoost turbocharged V6 with standard AWD. All models continue to use Ford’s well-integrated 6-speed automatic transmission. All also have a Sport mode for quicker acceleration, and paddle shifters replace the former awkward manual-shift buttons. With the max-towing package, all models of the Edge except the Sport are rated to pull 3,500 pounds, with the Sport rated for 2,000 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?Only minor changes are in store for the 2017 Ford Edge, which was totally revamped just two years ago. This year’s updates include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration for the optional Sync 3 infotainment system, new exterior colors, and a windshield wiper with de-icer included in the Cold Weather package.
The 2017 Ford Edge is a solid choice for those wanting a well-rounded midsize-crossover SUV but who don’t need a third row of seats.

The Kia Sorrento offers a more powerful 4-cylinder engine and a better warranty than the 2017 Dodge Journey, while the Toyota Highlander offers superior reliability and resale figures.
What's New?For 2017, the Dodge Journey R/T is dropped in favor of a new Journey GT trim. The Crossroad trim receives new satin-carbon wheel finish, while two new colors are added to the Journey’s color palette: Spitfire Orange and Rhino Clear Coat.
The 2017 Dodge Journey may not be the sexiest 7-passenger crossover SUV on the market, but there is no denying its value and versatility. A 4-cylinder Dodge Journey starts just under $22,500, undercutting newer rivals like the Kia Sorrento, Toyota Highlander and Hyundai Santa Fe. We think the 4-cylinder is too weak for this vehicle, however, and base models are sparsely optioned. If you’re going to do it right, get the 283-horsepower V6 and a mid-level trim such as the Crossroad. Add in all-wheel drive and you’ll have a comfortable, capable crossover SUV big enough to hold the kids and all their stuff, powerful enough to haul them with confidence and flexible enough to serve as everything from errand runner to weekend warrior.
Used 2017 Dodge Journey PricingFor 2017, the Dodge Journey has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $22,300, including destination charge. Mid-level versions such as the SXT and Crossroad are in the mid- to upper-$20,000 range, while a top-line GT version with AWD reaches the mid-$30,000 level. At its base price, the Dodge Journey SE remains the lowest-priced midsize SUV, and even after climbing trims is a good value among midsize SUVs such as the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Mazda CX-9 and Kia Sorento. The Mitsubishi Outlander with seating for seven is also a value leader among 3-row SUVs, but is smaller than the Journey. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Journey SUV. In the years ahead, the Journey’s residual value is expected to be average, still lagging the Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9 and Honda CR-V.
Driving the Used 2017 Dodge JourneyThough labeled an SUV, Dodge’s 2017 Journey is really a comfortable crossover SUV with a very car-like demeanor. The Journey’s unibody construction and advanced suspension help it absorb road imperfections and tackle tight turns with ease, making this 7-passenger crossover SUV feel more like a tall station wagon. We appreciate the Journey’s upright seating position and found the front seats to be supportive and comfortable, even after driving long distances. In twisting turns, the Journey’s steering feels precise and the wheel nicely weighted. There is lean when pushed hard, but it’s not as excessive as one might experience in a truck-based SUV. While the 4-cylinder’s 173 horsepower can move the Journey even when fully loaded, it doesn’t do so enthusiastically. That job is best left to the optional 283-horsepower V6 with 6-speed transmission, which offers superior power yet manages nearly identical fuel-economy estimates as the smaller 4-cylinder.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Dodge Journey’s cabin is available in a 2-row, 5-passenger layout or as a 3-row, 7-passenger configuration. Passenger space for adults is commendable up front and good in the second row, but legroom is very tight in the third row, which is best left for kids or occasional use. One of the best features of the Journey is its available Uconnect infotainment system. In addition to a large and easy-to-use 8.4-inch touch screen centered in the dash, there are supplementary buttons for climate and audio that are simple to see and use.
Exterior StylingIs it a sport-utility vehicle or the reincarnation of a station wagon? With the 2017 Journey from Dodge, its 192.4-inch length exceeds much of the competition, but Dodge’s designers have given it exterior treatments such as the chrome-trimmed cross-hair grille and eye-catching aluminum-alloy wheel choices that keep it from being merely bland. If a more stylish look is important, opt for the R/T version, with its 19-inch wheels, monochromatic treatment and distinctive R/T labels. For a tougher-looking version, there’s the Dodge Journey Crossroad, which features a faux skidplate, standard roof rails and blacked-out wheels.
Favorite FeaturesCARGO FLEXIBILITY When it comes to cargo management, the 2017 Dodge Journey is one of the most flexible and innovative SUVs anywhere. There are hidden storage bins beneath the 2nd-row floor and another under the front-passenger seat, which also folds flat, allowing cargo to fit right up to the dashboard’s edge.
 3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6 ENGINE The 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine is one of the smoothest, most fuel-efficient V6’s in the crossover-SUV segment. It also loves to run. Available on the SE, SXT and Crossroad trims and standard on the 2017 Dodge Journey GT, this engine is worth every penny the extra cost. 
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Dodge Journey 7-passenger crossover SUV is available in a five trims, from the base SE to the top-line GT. At its most basic, the Dodge Journey SUV includes dual-zone climate control, 4.3-inch touch-screen media center, keyless entry and push-button start, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power windows and door locks. Entertainment is provided by a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with auxiliary and USB inputs, but Bluetooth is optional. Safety features include electronic traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes, front-seat side airbags and side-curtain airbags for all rows.
Factory OptionsPlenty of options can be had on Dodge’s 2017 Journey crossover SUV. Among the more popular are 3-row seating (Flexible Seating Group), traction-enhancing all-wheel drive in lieu of the standard front-drive setup, an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect infotainment system and navigation. Amenities that bring an upscale feel include leather seating, Premium speakers, rear-seat video entertainment system with 9-inch screen and two wireless headphones, in-car Wi-Fi hotspot, and heated front seats and heated steering wheel. A Driver Convenience Group adds a rearview camera and distance-alert function when in reverse, but more advanced safety functions like blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking are not available.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available for Dodge’s 2017 Journey crossover SUV. Standard on all but the GT is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that makes an only-adequate 173 horsepower. The engine we recommend is the 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 that is optional on all but the GT trim, where it is standard. The V6 is also your only choice if you require all-wheel drive (AWD) instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD) to deal with inclement weather and slippery roads. Both engines run on regular unleaded gasoline. All Dodge Journeys use automatic transmissions, with the 4-cylinder stuck with an older-style 4-speed and the 6-cylinder using a more modern 6-speed. The Journey’s towing capacity is on the light end, limited to 1,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder and 2,500 with the V6.

The Mustang’s longtime archrival, the Chevy Camaro, itself is celebrating five decades of power and is readying a new ZL1 model.
What's New?One of the best additions for the 2017 Ford Mustang is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto phone connectivity, part of the Sync3 infotainment system available across the 2017 lineup. The formerly optional Track Package for Shelby GT350 models is now standard, but it increases the price of that performance model.
Few mainstream cars command appreciation like the Ford Mustang. For over five decades this sports car has pleased buyers of every stripe with its style, performance and attitude — all at a price within reach of the Everyday Joe or Jane. Overhauled just two years ago, the 2017 Ford Mustang continues to bask in the glory of its past while offering today’s amenities and technology. Available as a coupe or convertible, Ford’s pony car offers several powertrains, from the standard V6 to an efficient yet powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder and the iconic 5.0-liter V8. Topping the food chain are track-ready Shelby GT350 models. While even those still can’t out-muscle the Chevy Camaro ZL1 or Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat, the Mustang has bragging rights beyond mere horsepower.
Used 2017 Ford Mustang PricingThe 2017 Ford Mustang has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $25,545 for a V6 model with manual transmission. Opting for an automatic transmission is roughly $1,200 extra. A turbocharged Mustang with the EcoBoost 4-cylinder starts $1,000 higher, while a Mustang GT with the 5.0-liter V8 begins at $33,545 — not a lot for a car that packs 435 horsepower. Convertibles start just over $31,000 and climb just past $43,000 with a 5.0-liter V8. The base price of a Mustang Shelby GT350 — available in coupe form only — has increased to $56,495, largely because the formerly optional Track Package is now standard. The Mustang’s prices slightly undercut those of the Chevy Camaro and Dodge Challenger. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to get the best deal. The Mustang’s resale value is expected to split the difference between the Camaro and Challenger.
Driving the Used 2017 Ford MustangWith the independent rear suspension that arrived a couple of years ago as part of its 6th-generation revamp, the Ford Mustang finally handles like a modern car. In addition to being more nimble than its solid-axle predecessors, it’s just better in everyday driving, with a smoother ride and none of the jittery rear-end motions of the old car. Whether you choose the standard V6, small but potent EcoBoost 4-cylinder or the 5.0-liter V8, all Mustang models are notably quick. However, it’s the last of these that truly sounds like a Ford Mustang should, with an auditory rumble and roar that’s pure Americana. The pricey Shelby GT350 offers true track-ready performance and an addicting howl from its 5.2-liter V8. The Mustang’s 6-speed manual transmission is commendable, with short throws and solid feel. If you prefer the 6-speed automatic, you can still pick your own gears with paddles mounted on the steering wheel.
Interior ComfortCoupe or convertible, Ford’s modern muscle car seats four passengers but the rear seats are extremely tight — and in the hard-core Shelby GT350R, nonexistent. Up front, room is decent for driver and passenger. The front seats are comfortable, and the sturdy audio/climate-control switches are easy to reach. Beware the rear blind spots in coupes created by the raked roof. The Ford Mustang’s trunk is bigger than you might expect — 13.5 cubic feet in coupes, 11.4 in convertibles — and the rear seats fold flat to accommodate longer items. The Mustang convertible uses a one-hand release latch for the power-operated soft top.
Exterior StylingWith its long hood, short trunk, sloping rear glass and tri-bar taillights, the 2017 Ford Mustang could never be mistaken for anything other than Ford’s pony car. Yet this is no retro-wannabe. The sleek lines, aggressive headlights and windswept design also make the latest Mustang totally relevant today. Gone is the bulkiness of the previous design, replaced with a lower, wider-looking car that, from most angles, is beautiful. Convertibles look best with the lined and insulated fabric top folded, but even when up it’s still unmistakably Mustang. Active grille shutters on 2.3-liter models can close to redirect airflow, improving aerodynamics.
Favorite FeaturesCREATURE COMFORTSMuscle cars used to put brawn first, even if that meant bruising passengers. Not so with the new Mustang. Consider the heated and cooled front seats, CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and even active noise cancellation for a quieter ride. All are easily available on the 2017 Mustang.
IT’S BURNOUT-READYLet’s be honest: You know you want to. That’s why the new Mustang 5.0 features a standard ""line-lock"" mode that locks the front brakes for standing burnouts. Manual-transmission GT models also include launch control for maximum acceleration.
Standard FeaturesThe least expensive Ford Mustang V6 Fastback comes equipped with a rearview camera, push-button start, Track Apps showing performance metrics like g-forces, selectable-effort steering (Normal/Sport/Comfort), 4-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, high-intensity headlights and 17-inch aluminum wheels. Standard audio is an AM/FM/CD system with two USB inputs and Sync Bluetooth connectivity. Safety features include traction and stability control and front, side and knee airbags. EcoBoost trims include the turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, power front seats, LED fog lights, 18-inch wheels and decklid spoiler. GT Mustangs have the iconic 5.0-liter V8, larger brakes and the line-lock feature for burnouts — for track use only, wink wink.
Factory OptionsFrom ventilated front seats to a Shaker audio system and Brembo performance brakes, there’s a slew of options to suit your taste and budget. We’re fans of the new Sync3 system, which is far easier to see and use than past versions of Ford’s infotainment system, and for 2017 is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and has nine speakers and navigation. Leather interior is optional, as is blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The track-ready-but-street-legal Mustang Shelby 350R can be more like the slightly less-intense Shelby 350 by reequipping it with an audio system, rear seat and air conditioning.
Engine & TransmissionFour engines are now available for the 2017 Mustang, with even the least making a potent 300 ponies. Base models use a naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V6, while EcoBoost models have a turbocharged 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine. For those who won’t recognize a Mustang with anything less than a V8, the GT is your ride. It’s ready to roll with a 5.0. For buyers who plan to track their Mustang or simply desire a real screamer, there are the Shelby GT350 models, which use a 5.2-liter V8 that spits out 526 horsepower in both the standard and GT350R derivative. All Mustangs are rear-wheel drive and come with a 6-speed manual transmission. A 6-speed automatic transmission is optional on all except the Shelby variants.

The Sierra’s impressive towing ability is augmented by bold styling and new driver-assist features, giving two more reasons to buy.","ConsThe 2017 GMC Sierra has no answer to the diesel-engine options from the Ram 1500 and Nissan Titan, both of which offer superior fuel-economy figures. If you just need light-pickup duty, you can find nearly equal bed and payload ability in a GMC Canyon or Toyota Tacoma.",29500,"Driving the Used 2017 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabThe 2017 GMC Sierra 1500 pickup has a rather obvious split personality. At first glance you’ll see a sturdy and capable full-size pickup truck posting excellent towing, payload and people-carrying figures. Look again and you’ll find a rather luxurious cabin so nice you may not want to take it to a job site or muddy off-road locale. The Sierra’s standard 5.3-liter V8 is well suited to this truck, delivering decent fuel economy and excellent pulling and passing power. The interior is amazingly well insulated from road and wind noise and the ride is settled and confident over most road surfaces, although washboard back roads can send a pronounced shudder through the cabin. One of our adventures had us towing a 5,000-pound 1970s’ luxury car to a new home. Not only did the Sierra perform admirably, fuel economy suffered only a few miles per gallon and the trailer-sway control performed exactly as promised.
Interior ComfortWith big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, GMC’s 2017 Sierra’s roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be luxurious, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers’ devices. Cab configurations include regular with a 3-passenger bench, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.
Exterior StylingWe dub GMC’s latest styling experiment “contemporary macho.” Like previous GMC trucks, this full-size pickup features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck proud. With the bold styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5-feet-8 inches to eight feet. Double-cab models have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED INFOTAINMENT
The full-size 2017 GMC Sierra pickup offers a choice of two IntelliLink audio systems, one with a 7-inch screen and the other, eight inches. Its five USB ports and 110-volt outlet address most gadget needs, as do the 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability.
DRIVER-ALERT SEAT
Built into the Sierra’s lane-departure and forward-collision warning system is a vibrating driver’s seat that helps alert the driver of potential danger. Depending if the vehicle is drifting right or left, a corresponding vibrating pulse is sent through the driver’s seat cushion alerting the driver an immediate course correction is in order.
Standard FeaturesEven the most basic 2017 GMC Sierra includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats and a 7-inch touch-screen AM/FM radio with USB/SD inputs, but no CD player, Bluetooth or telescoping steering wheel. Step up to an SLE trim and you’ll get a rearview camera, 6-speaker audio and 17-inch wheels made of premium aluminum instead of steel. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen command center, power-adjustable pedals and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali’s 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio and leather-clad front bucket seats.
Factory OptionsAdd-ons are available across the 2017 Sierra lineup. All Sierras can be ordered as 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel (4WD), while those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Options include the Driver Alert Package with low-speed automatic braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, IntelliBeam headlights and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package features off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available for the 2017 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8 and the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. The V6 is linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter employ an 8-speed automatic, but only when ordered with the SLE and Denali trim. All three engines have laudable towing capacity, including the V6’s max of 7,600 pounds. The 6.2-liter V8 can pull up to 12,500 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,100 pounds and a highway rating of 23 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC’s engine lineup. All engines use direct injection and Active Fuel Management, which allows them to run on fewer cylinders and thus use less fuel.

If you prefer your full-size pickups upright and rugged, as opposed to slickly styled and fad-laden, the 2017 GMC Sierra 1500 pickup should be pleasing to your eye. While it shares most of its mechanical underpinnings with the Chevy Silverado 1500, the Sierra brings a bit more upscale styling and features to the mix, not to mention the unrivaled Denali trim with its standard 6.2-liter V8. You can find similar features and style in a decked-out Ram 1500 or Ford F-150, but at the base level, the Sierra is pretty much on par with all of its rivals. Regardless, the GMC Sierra 1500 for 2017 has the muscle to excel in the categories that matter most to pickup buyers, namely payload, towing and horsepower.

The new Charger uniquely combines comfort, interior room and technology with aggressive styling, horsepower to spare and just enough attitude to keep the mice away.","ConsIf fuel economy is more important to you than tire-shredding horsepower, you should be shopping other sedans. Also, not everyone is comfortable with the Charger’s bodybuilder bod. If you’re concerned about standing out on the road or in the company parking lot, you might consider something less, well, noticeable.",29000,"Driving the Used 2017 Dodge ChargerThe 3.6-liter, 292-horsepower V6 in the 2017 Dodge Charger SE and SXT offers plenty of punch with either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD). The standard 8-speed automatic transmission is smooth and doesn’t annoyingly hunt for gears. It’s a compelling package, but Chargers get better when you add horsepower, and the 370-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 in the R/T and Daytona is a nice wake-up call. The one to get, however, is the 485-horsepower 6.4-liter in the R/T Scat Pack, Daytona 392 and SRT 392 trims. It’s the best combination of price (especially in the R/T Scat Pack), power and daily drivability. Don’t misunderstand, the 707-horsepower Hellcat Charger has to be experienced to be believed. It will go down in history. Become a legend. But it’s extreme and only makes sense for a few. Overall, the Chargers are smooth and responsive, with an appropriate blend of handling precision and comfortable ride.
Interior ComfortInviting, comfortable and functional, the interior of the 2017 the Dodge Charger is a pleasant place to spend time. Cockpit-style, the instrument panel angles all the working stuff toward the driver, the gauge cluster is configurable for individual preferences, and there are numerous controls mounted on the steering wheel. In the center is an available 8.4-inch touch screen, and it and the Uconnect infotainment system are a couple of features we recommend. Front seats are comfortable for long trips, the rear bench will handle three adults and the entire well-designed presentation is also easy on the eyes.
Exterior StylingThis is no wallflower. No shrinking violet. No wolf in sheep’s clothing. No cliché. The 2017 Dodge Charger looks like what it is: a modern American sedan with plenty of horsepower. It looks tough. It looks mean. It looks you right in the eye. Despite a roofline and overall shape unmistakably linked to previous Chargers built from 1968-1970, this sedan successfully fights being old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern front to rear. Its smoothly rounded nose makes obvious aerodynamic contributions, and the attractive rear includes Dodge’s distinctive layout of the “racetrack” taillight arrangement, which certainly stands out in after-dark traffic. 
Favorite FeaturesUCONNECTThe new fourth generation of Uconnect is one of the best automotive infotainment systems and one of the easiest to use. Maps are supplied by Garmin, and the Bluetooth connects your phone almost instantaneously. The new system’s larger 8.4-inch screen also allows for phone-style navigation gestures like pinch and swipe.
6.2-LITER HELLCAT SUPERCHARGED V8There’s no other sedan engine, at any price, that comes close to competing with the 707-horsepower, 6.2-liter, supercharged Hemi in the Hellcat version of the 2017 Charger. It’s the most powerful American sedan of all time. Considering the price, it’s one of the go-fast deals of all time.
Standard FeaturesLED daytime running lights, acoustic front glass and windshield, power windows with express front up/down, and a configurable, full-color, 7-inch driver-information display are all standard features on the base 2017 Dodge Charger SE. Also standard are chrome exhaust tips, auto headlights that turn themselves on and off, power mirrors, 17-inch wheels and tires, and an electronic reconfigurable gauge cluster. Standard powertrain is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with a strong 292 horsepower backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. With a wide range of trim levels, there is, obviously, an equally wide range of standard-equipment listings.
Factory OptionsThe trim levels are tied closely to the engine choices, with corresponding moves upward not only in performance but also in features and luxury. Depending on the trim level and options chosen you can have a 2017 Dodge Charger with a base price well under $30 grand or well over $60,000, and with horsepower just under 300 or more than twice that. Major options include a power sunroof, Beats by Dr. Dre and harman/kardon sound systems, and a variety of packages: Super Track Pak, Premium Group, Technology Group, Driver Confidence Group, Navigation/Rear Backup Camera Group, and others.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 Charger is available with four engine choices. Base, in SE and SXT models, is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with 292 horsepower and plenty of performance for just about anybody. Next up is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 of 370 horsepower, in R/T and Daytona versions. It’s one more step to a 6.4-liter Hemi of 485 horsepower, in R/T Scat Pack and Daytona 392 and SRT 392 trims. And, if a 485-horsepower Hemi isn’t quite enough, there’s the 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi in the SRT Hellcat, with 707 horsepower. In all cases, the transmission is an 8-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive (RWD). All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on the V6 models. Truly, there is something here for just about anyone who likes to stand on the gas.

Graphics, 20-inch wheels and more powerful brakes are standard. SXT and up models get an all-new Uconnect infotainment system with a larger 8.4-inch screen.
Family-friendly 4-door sedans don’t get more rambunctiously pulse-quickening and unapologetic than America’s full-size 2017 Dodge Charger. With over a half-dozen trim choices, and available all-wheel drive, the 2017 Charger offers a bold motoring statement in a wide variety of flavors, the latest in-cabin technology, road-warrior styling and a lengthy assortment of options. Four engines are available ranging from a 292-horsepower fuel-efficient V6 to the Charger Hellcat’s supercharged Hemi V8 that makes a mind-blowing 707 horsepower. It’s the most powerful American car ever. It’s not the only domestic sedan with performance and style but, with its arrogant attitude and generous bang-for-the-buck, the alternatives — Chevrolet Impala, Buick LaCrosse, Ford Fusion — just don’t have the in-your-face appeal and that kind of optional power.

If you don’t need the Escalade’s oversized abilities, you’ll likely find a nimble Audi Q7 or Infiniti QX60 more appealing.",74500,"Driving the Used 2017 Cadillac EscaladeA vehicle as robust as the 2017 Cadillac Escalade luxury SUV requires an equal under the hood, and Cadillac’s 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V8 is just the beast. Power for passing and merging is never in short supply, but there is a price to pay at the pump, although we doubt anyone who can afford the Escalade will much care. On the road, GM’s Magnetic Ride Control does an admirable job managing the Escalade’s bulk, allowing it to negotiate tight turns with little fuss. The power steering assist is appropriately proportioned, with a nice heavy feel to the steering wheel that lightens up at lower speeds. Add the optional 4-wheel drive (4WD) and the Escalade becomes a winter warrior capable of tackling all kinds of road conditions. Regrettably, the Escalade’s size and poor approach angles prevent it from going places where you can take a Lexus LX or Land Rover Range Rover.
Interior ComfortBy far the biggest standout feature for the 2017 Cadillac Escalade is its interior. Boasting soft-touch materials as far as the eye can see, the Escalade wows every time you enter. Leather and real wood give off a refined feel — something missing from previous-generation Escalades. All models can be had with a 2nd-row bench seat allowing seating for eight passengers in lieu of a pair of bucket seats and seating for seven. Third-row legroom is tight in standard models, but the extended-length 2017 Cadillac ESV SUV rectifies that while also offering considerably more cargo space behind the rearmost seats.
Exterior StylingAlong with its powerful grille and streamlined rear quarters, the 2017 Cadillac Escalade benefits from the addition of full-LED headlights and taillights. There are four crystals in the headlights that act as the high beams, giving off radiant light. The long vertical taillights also employ LEDs, making it easier to follow the Escalade when weather conditions are less than ideal. While originally installed for aerodynamic purposes, the spoiler also hides the rear windshield-wiper blade. ESV models add even more length, coming in at a total of 224.3 inches compared to the 203.9 inches of the standard model.
Favorite FeaturesFOLD-FLAT 2ND- and 3RD-ROW SEATS
Combine its flat-folding 2nd- and 3rd-row seats with the 2017 Cadillac Escalade’s massive interior, and you’ll create an enormous level floor large enough to accommodate anything requiring up to 94.2 cubic feet of space.
REAR CAMERA MIRROR
Cadillac’s 2017 Escalade luxury SUV can be equipped with a rear camera mirror that uses streaming video to improve the rear field of vision by 300 percent. Unlike a traditional mirror, the camera mirror can reduce glare and improve the image in low-light situations.
Standard FeaturesYou can’t miss the chrome grille, but you might not see the active-aero shutters behind it. Then there are the 12-way power-adjustable seats, 20-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels, Magnetic Ride Control and hands-free power liftgate. A remote starter, tri-zone climate control, and a reconfigurable instrument cluster further the Escalade’s appeal, as does a power-folding 3rd-row seat, heated and cooling front seats, front and rear park assists, rain-sensing wipers, a surround-vision camera, Automatic Park Assist, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible 16-speaker Bose Centerpoint audio, CUE with navigation and a power tilt/telescopic steering column with heated leather-wrapped steering wheel.
Factory OptionsLane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, adaptive cruise control, side blind-zone alert, rear camera mirror, cross-traffic alert, and 22-inch machine-finished wheels are all available on the 2017 Cadillac Escalade. For buyers seeking the most indulgence, the new range-topping Platinum line comes with Nappa semi-aniline leather, suede microfiber headliner and climate-controlled 18-way-adjustable front seats complete with massaging functionality for the driver’s side.
Engine & TransmissionYou have one choice when it comes to motivating the 2017 Cadillac Escalade luxury SUV, and that’s the 6.2-liter V8 engine rated at 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission for both 2WD and 4WD models is an 8-speed automatic with driver shift control and tow/haul mode. Even with the 8-speed transmission, this engine gets parched quickly, and the EPA’s ratings of 15/22 mpg for the rear-wheel-drive (2WD) model and 15/20 mpg for the 4WD variant reflect that. While premium gasoline is recommended, the Escalade’s engine doesn’t require it, so you can save a few cents at the pump.

New standard equipment includes Automatic Park Assist that uses ultrasonic sensors to automatically park the Escalade in either a parallel or perpendicular spot.
In the world of full-size luxury SUVs, Cadillac’s Escalade for 2017 occupies a unique spot. Only the Lincoln Navigator L can match the Escalade ESV for length, but it’s no match for the big Caddy’s power, technology and luxury features. In terms of sheer interior volume, Mercedes-Benz, Infiniti, BMW and Lexus don’t offer anything close, and none can match the Escalade’s sheer styling audacity. Powered by a massive 6.2-liter V8 engine, the Escalade can tow up to 8,300 pounds, not as much the Lincoln Navigator or Infiniti QX80, but superior to the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, Audi Q7 and Lexus LX. Luxury amenities abound and the Escalade’s tasteful use of leather, wood and color make its interior one of the best in the segment.

The Jeep also bests the Explorer both off-road and in towing (7,800 pounds vs. 5,000).",32000,"Driving the Used 2017 Ford ExplorerWhen it comes to horsepower, Ford’s 7-passenger Explorer SUV for 2017 delivers at every level. From the standard 290-horsepower V6 to the fuel-efficient 280-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder available in the base, XLT and Limited trims, Ford places choice front and center. Need more “oomph”? Try out the Sport and Platinum trim’s 365-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6. Capable for sure, the Explorer delivers excellent passing and pulling power and its heavily weighted steering and taut suspension give this big SUV impressive cornering ability, although its high beltline and massive front bumper make maneuvers in tight quarters a bit harrowing. Ford has done an excellent job keeping road, engine and wind noise out of the cabin, and all but the rearmost occupants felt the seating was both comfortable and supportive. The Explorer’s adaptive cruise control works well, but we wish it offered fully autonomous braking like the Honda Pilot, not just collision warning.
Interior ComfortThe Ford Explorer SUV for 2017 seats up to seven in its three rows, and thanks to its overall size even the third row offers room for adults. The second row comes as either a 3-person bench, or it can be had with two bucket seats. Fold both seating rows and you have generous cargo space. We’re happy that Ford has moved to using actual buttons for most controls, and also like the looks of the digital screen integrated into the gauges. Other improvements are aimed at making the Explorer friendlier to drivers of all sizes, such as repositioned armrests.
Exterior StylingLast year’s upgrades didn’t alter the Explorer’s basic silhouette, but the details are quite nice. The standard LED low-beam headlights, grille and bumper in front give this mainstream SUV a first-glance resemblance to a Land Rover Range Rover, pretty good company we’d say, although the lower part of the bumper looks too heavy. We like the addition of a front-view camera on the Explorer, as well as front parking sensors, both handy when maneuvering through a parking lot.
Favorite FeaturesBUTTONS
With more and more SUVs moving to touch-screen-only interfaces, it’s rather refreshing to see sometimes the old ways are still the best ways. Sure, the 2017 Ford Explorer features a big 8-inch touch screen, but it also has easy-to-reach and -operate controls for the climate and audio.
TERRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Because Ford’s 2017 Explorer is a crossover SUV, it lacks the rugged body-on-frame design once common to off-road SUVs. To compensate, Ford’s Terrain Management System offers varying settings for the AWD system including snow, sand, mud, grass and gravel.
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Ford Explorer SUV comes in five models: base, XLT, Limited, Sport and Platinum. Base models come standard with the 3.5-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, LED low-beam headlights and LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, and a rearview camera that incorporates a washer to keep the lens clean. Other standard features include cruise control, air conditioning, a 6-speaker audio system, and Ford’s Sync. Ford’s MyKey allows drivers to program top speed and other parameters to help prevent young drivers from behaving recklessly. Other safety features include trailer Sway Control for easier towing.
Factory OptionsAs is often the case these days, moving up through the model lineup is the best way to get more on your new Explorer. The mid-level XLT is a good value, offering leather seats, navigation, blind-spot detection, inflatable rear seatbelts, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a dual-panel moonroof. Base, XLT and Limited models can substitute the 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder for the standard V6, and AWD is available across the board, regardless of engine. The Platinum model comes with the twin-turbo EcoBoost V6, plus high-end leather, a premium audio system, leather-covered dash and other luxury items.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 on the Ford Explorer is fine for most people, offering decent power and acceptable fuel economy. The 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine makes a good argument for itself though. Despite being a little down on power compared to the V6, the EcoBoost four offers notably more torque. We expect this engine to be the choice for many buyers. Available on the Sport and Platinum models is the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, bumping power up to a more-than-adequate 365 horsepower. All Ford Explorer models can be equipped with all-wheel drive and include the Terrain Management System. Additionally, all models use a 6-speed automatic transmission complete with paddle shifters on the steering wheel.

What's New?BMW sweats the details for the 2017 X5. Most of the changes involve relabeling various option packages, but the X5 now comes standard with touch-screen capability for the iDrive infotainment system, a navigation system updated to iDrive 5.0, and available wireless charging and Wi-Fi hotspots.
Although the 2017 BMW X5 gets called a ""sports-activity vehicle"" or SAV by its maker, we know a luxury SUV when we see one. Going head to head against the Porsche Cayenne and Mercedes-Benz GLE, the 2017 X5 emphasizes the ""sport"" part of sport-utility vehicle. The resulting lineup of luxury SUV models includes a hybrid, a diesel, and even a fire-breathing M version, all of which are fun to drive. The X5 is big, but still midsize, so it’s easy to manage through traffic and parking lots, while remaining roomy and comfortable at the same time. Note that the ""utility"" part doesn’t extend as far off-road as you can go in a Land Rover or even a Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Used 2017 BMW X5 PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a rear-wheel-drive 2017 BMW X5 sDrive35i is almost $56,500, including the $995 destination charge. Prices climb quickly; all-wheel drive adds another $2,300; the diesel is more than $60,200, and the hybrid comes in at a bit more than $63,000. If you want V8 power you’re looking at $73,300 for the xDrive50i, or nearly $100,000 for the X5 M. Options can add thousands of dollars more. Price wise, it splits the difference between the slightly smaller Mercedes-Benz GLE and the slightly bigger GLS. However, the Audi Q7, Infiniti QX60 and QX70, Acura MDX, Lexus RX and Porsche Cayenne all start less than the BMW. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note that the X5’s resale value is on par with Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, better than the Land Rover but still behind the Lexus RX.
Driving the Used 2017 BMW X5Even the ""slow"" BMW X5 is pretty quick, thanks to a lineup of five different engines that never struggle to accelerate this big luxury SUV. The entry-level X5 sDrive35i is the only rear-drive (RWD) model, and its turbocharged inline-6 easily moves it to 60 mph in less than seven seconds. The plug-in hybrid X5 xDrive40e does the same run in 6.5 seconds, as does the xDrive35d turbodiesel, meaning you don’t have to choose between fuel efficiency and horsepower. However, if you only care about the latter, you have multiple options. There’s the 445-horsepower V8 in the X5 xDrive50i or, if you want to go completely nuts with your big luxury SUV, there’s the X5 M, with 567 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) makes the X5 an all-weather performer, with surprisingly good handling for such a large heavy vehicle. However, that handling means the ride isn’t quite as cushy as some of its competitors.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 X5 can theoretically seat seven, thanks to an available 2-passenger third row. However, it’s so tiny that you’d best leave it folded most of the time for better cargo space. However, the first and second rows are plenty roomy and comfortable, with plenty of space even for adults with large frames. That 2nd-row seat folds in a 40/20/40 configuration, handy for fitting long items like skis down the middle without sacrificing a seating position. The infotainment system is easier to use than ever thanks to a new touch-screen interface, and the controls are easy to find and understand.
Exterior StylingFrom a distance the 2017 X5 looks a lot like its smaller brother, the X3. This is a good thing, because it means that BMW’s stylists have cleverly hidden the majority of the BMW’s bulk. The twin-port ""kidney"" grille flows into the headlights, there are ""Aero Blades"" channeling air for better aerodynamics, and the design is simply proportioned better than it has ever been. On the practical side, there are roof rails for additional cargo space, and the 2-section tailgate allows you to lift the top half while leaving the bottom closed; the bottom half also doubles as a seat for tailgating.
Favorite FeaturesINFOTAINMENT SYSTEMWe already liked the BMW X5’s big 10.2-inch infotainment screen and intuitive scroll-and-click user interface. Now it’s even better with a new touch screen, letting you either tap the screen or use the dial when it makes the most sense. Plus the high-resolution screen is super-sharp.
STEERING FEELDefining characteristics of BMWs are their taut handling and precise steering. If you’re the kind of driver who appreciates tackling sharp turns and feeling one with the car, you’ll find the X5’s direct steering feel and immediate feedback addicting.
Standard FeaturesThe basic 2017 BMW X5 sDrive35i comes nicely equipped for the most part, with a noteworthy omission. On the standard-equipment list are 10-way-power and heated front seats, a panoramic moonroof, navigation with a 10.2-inch high-res touch screen that’s updated to the latest iDrive 5.0 system, a power tailgate, rearview camera, power-adjustable steering column, 9-speaker audio system with HD Radio, and xenon adaptive headlights. However, despite the price you don’t get leather seats standard. Spring for the V8-powered X5 xDrive50i model and you get leather, along with 19-inch wheels and luxurious, 20-way-power front seats. Four years/50,000 miles of complimentary maintenance is also standard.
Factory OptionsThere’s a virtual cornucopia of features available for the BMW X5 lineup, from a heated steering wheel and ventilated seats, to a night-vision assist system, to audio systems that include a 1,200-watt Bang & Olufsen system. However, BMW has altered things this year, turning the Luxury and M Sport ""lines"" into discrete option packages. The xLine remains though, adding stainless-steel underbody cladding in the front and rear, silver matte grille surround and exterior trim, and an anthracite headliner inside. The M Sport package adds M badges and other sporty-looking trim, while the Luxury package adds chrome exterior accents.
Engine & TransmissionThe sDrive35i and xDrive35i come with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 with a nice even 300 horsepower, while the xDrive35d uses a diesel with 255 horsepower but a whopping 413 lb-ft of torque. The V8-powered xDrive50i offers a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 with 445 horsepower, while the king-of-the-hill X5 M offers a blistering 567 horses from its turbocharged V8. The xDrive40e hybrid mates a 2.0-liter turbo-4 to an integrated electric motor for a total of 308 horsepower. Every engine comes connected to a slick 8-speed automatic transmission, and all X5 SUVs have a start/stop function that shuts down the engine at idle. It restarts quickly enough when you lift your foot from the brake, but its intrusiveness had us reaching for the ""off"" button.

That’s the secret to the Wrangler’s timeless appeal. Whether you’re headed for the hills for a weekend of dirty play or just dropping the kids off at volleyball practice, the new Wrangler doesn’t just get you there, it makes it fun.","ConsIf luxury, comfort and car-like ride and handling are your top priorities, there are many other SUVs available that would suit your desires better than the Jeep Wrangler, including Jeep’s own Cherokee and Renegade. The Wrangler is not a luxury car. If you expect it to be, you will be disappointed.",25000,"Driving the Used 2017 Jeep WranglerWith front and rear solid axles, a body-on-frame layout, generous ground clearance, minimal overhangs, capable 4-wheel drive, compliant suspension and rugged construction, the 2017 Jeep Wrangler is built to perform off-road. However, there’s no free lunch. All that makes the new Jeep Wrangler nearly unstoppable off-road, keeps it from being supremely car-like in town. This is either part of its charm or a reason to shop other vehicles. Curb your expectations a bit and the Wrangler isn’t awful in the city. The suspension deals with road irregularities pretty well, and the precise steering is as welcome off-pavement as on. Still, the ride is not that of even a mid-range sedan, and it’s ridiculously loud at highway speeds thanks to its barnlike aerodynamics, which also sabotages highway fuel economy. Instead, get away from pavement, take advantage of the excellent Pentastar V6 engine and the Wrangler’s marvelous off-road capabilities, and enjoy yourself.
Interior ComfortEven with the available leather, the 2017 Jeep Wrangler’s interior does not qualify as plush. The main requirement is durability, which describes the Sport model’s cloth seats and the hard plastic surfaces. But there’s plenty of versatility: The rear seat will fold flat for carrying gear and which in the 4-door Unlimited models will accommodate three people. The instrument panel is not necessarily stylish but does have the control functions within easy reach. And, as it has been for years, if the interior gets really dirty you can pull the handy drain plugs and clean it out with a garden hose.
Exterior StylingAfter 75 years, the Jeep Wrangler’s function-over-form design remains among the most enduring, and endearing, on the planet. It’s unmistakable and recognized around the world. From time to time there are minor changes, but Jeep wouldn’t dare alter its iconic 7-slot grille, classic round headlights and trapezoid fenders any more than you’d change the shape of a Coke bottle or the Porsche 911. The upright windshield allows great outward visibility and folds down for those times off-road when you need to lean over the hood. Tires pushed out to the corners give the Wrangler unmatched approach and departure angles.
Favorite Features3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6 Chrysler’s Pentastar V6 is the best thing to happen to the Jeep Wrangler since the first Jeep helped the allies win World War II. It’s smooth, powerful and delivers decent fuel economy. It’s perfectly suited to the Wrangler. In addition to the 6-speed manual transmission, there’s an available 5-speed automatic.
 COMMANDING OFF-ROAD CAPABILITY Any Wrangler can get it done off-road thanks to solid axles, generous ground clearance, short overhangs, and terrific 4-wheel-drive systems. For more, step up to the Rubicon with heavy-duty axles and transfer case, lower gearing, locking differentials, a disconnecting front sway bar and larger tires. It’ll climb the Hillary Step. 
Standard FeaturesThree major items are standard on every 2017 Jeep Wrangler: a 285-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed manual transmission and 4-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case. Every Wrangler also gets skidplates to protect the fuel tank and transfer case, stability control with roll mitigation, hill-start assist, trailer-sway control, a USB port and an 8-speaker audio system. The doors are removable, and there’s a tool kit for doing just that, and a folding soft-top is standard, even on the 4-door Wrangler Unlimited. What is not standard on the base Sport model are power windows, door locks and even air conditioning.
Factory OptionsThe 2017 Jeep Wrangler options list is comprehensive and, primarily, aimed at additional capabilities off-road. Although there is also a Power Convenience Group that adds desirable amenities and makes the Wrangler far more livable on a daily basis, things like power locks, power mirrors, power windows and keyless entry. There’s also a new Cold Weather package available on Sport S and Rubicon models. It includes heated front seats, an engine-block heater and a remote-start system. With the packages and options, which even include a navigation system, buyers can easily order the Wrangler of his or her dreams.
Engine & TransmissionThe only engine for the 2017 Wrangler is Chrysler’s terrific 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, with 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. It’s one of our favorites. Its smooth power delivery makes easy work of highways or rock crawls, and it’s by far the best engine ever in a Wrangler and it runs on regular gasoline. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard and a 5-speed automatic is available as an option. In the 2-door Wrangler, there’s no difference in fuel economy between the two. There are so many variations of axles and gear ratios that both the manual and automatic gearboxes work well on or off highways, and we’re enamored enough of 3-pedal driving that we’d probably choose the manual.
 3.6-liter V6 285 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm 260 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/21 mpg (Wrangler), 17/20 mpg (Wrangler Unlimited, automatic), 17/21 mpg (Wrangler Unlimited, manual)
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.
Read Full Review","What's New?For 2017 the Wrangler changes little. New LED headlights and fog lights are optional on Sport and Sport S models and standard on Sahara and Rubicon. Also a new Cold Weather package is available on Sport S and Rubicon models. It includes special tires and an engine-block heater.
The Jeep Wrangler is an authentic American original. For its loyalists it’s nothing short of Old Glory with 4-wheel drive. Still true to its original concept after 75 years, the 2017 Jeep Wrangler continues to deliver exceptional off-road capability with ever-increasing amounts of on-road civility in an affordable package. Jeep continues to refine and develop the Wrangler lineup, which now includes the original 2-door Wrangler and the family-friendly 4-door Wrangler Unlimited, both in soft-top and hardtop versions. The result is a vehicle that can be used in the city during the week and abused in the country on the weekends. Four trim levels are available, Sport, Sport S, Sahara and the hard-core Rubicon. All have Chrysler’s smooth and strong 3.6-liter, 285-horsepower V6 engine.

That 3,500-pound towing capacity in V6 models is sure to come in handy, too.","ConsBig on the outside, but small on the inside, the Equinox isn’t exactly a champion at space management. The smaller Honda CR-V offers more cargo space, and it’s easier to use, too. If you want even more passenger space, plus good cargo room, check out the 2-row Kia Sorento.",24000,"Driving the Used 2017 Chevrolet EquinoxYou’d think that having a more-than-100-horsepower advantage over most of its competitors would give V6-powered Chevy Equinox models a distinct edge when it comes to performance. However, it has to overcome nearly two tons of mass, considerably more than its smaller competition, and it cancels out the V6’s advantage to some extent. However, the Equinox does offer up a comfortably relaxed ride around town or on the highway, although the standard 4-cylinder engine is too noisy at full throttle. Fuel economy is pretty good. But so what if it’s not fun to drive? The compact-SUV market isn’t exactly brimming with models that yearn for a twisty back road — Mazda CX-5 notwithstanding — so the Equinox’s quiet comfort is an advantage, or at least par for the course. However, there’s no hiding that the Equinox is getting old compared to its competitors, and is due for an update.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Equinox interior is a little bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, there’s nice cloth trim on base models, leather available on LT and Premier models, and creature comforts like automatic climate control and a 7-inch touch screen. But the downside is space. Despite its outer dimensions, the Equinox comes up short on cargo space even compared to notably smaller vehicles, like the 10-inch-shorter Honda CR-V. On the other hand, the excellent rear legroom helps mitigate the cargo disadvantage if you haul people more frequently than things. All seating positions are comfortable, with plenty of room in front, too.
Exterior StylingYou wouldn’t know by a glance that the 2017 Chevy Equinox is longer than the midsize 3-row Kia Sorento SUV. We give credit to the soft curves and narrow stance for disguising the overall size of the Equinox, especially the latter, as it isn’t any wider than other compact-SUV models. Two new color packages are available this year: The Midnight Package goes all-black, with black exterior paint, wheels and trim. The Equinox Sport should really be called “Stormtrooper,” as its white body is contrasted with black everything else. Chrome exhaust tips distinguish V6 models.
Favorite FeaturesADJUSTABLE POWER LIFTGATE
Power liftgates are nothing new, but neither is the “Oh no, STOP!” feeling those with low-ceiling garages get when the liftgate blindly soldiers upward. Thankfully, the Chevy Equinox lets you adjust the maximum height of the liftgate on 2LT and Premier models. It also helps if you’re just vertically challenged.
REAR-SEAT LEGROOM
If for some reason you don’t have enough legroom in the rear seat of the Chevy Equinox, reach down, and slide the seat back. Not only does the adjustable rear seat offer tons of legroom, it also makes it easier to get a child seat in and out.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2017 Equinox L comes standard with a rearview camera, manual air conditioning, an audio system with a 7-inch touch-screen display, phone-only Bluetooth and USB, and of course power windows and mirrors. There’s also standard cruise control, and a multi-information display between the main gauges that provides feedback on things like fuel economy and range. Safety features include traction and stability control, and multiple airbags. There’s also OnStar service that features 4G connectivity and Wi-Fi.
Factory OptionsYou can order all-wheel drive on LS, LT and Premier Equinox models, and you can get the V6 engine on LT and Premier. Other options include a Chevy MyLink system that includes navigation, but unfortunately Apple CarPlay is not part of the equation, despite being available on many other Chevy models. The LT model is the only way to get the new Midnight or Sport packages, not to mention blind-spot detection and rear cross-path detection. The Premier adds lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert. Other options include a power tailgate with a programmable height and even a rear-seat DVD player.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available for Equinox buyers. Standard in all trims is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 182 horsepower. However, with 3,700 pounds of compact SUV to haul around, the 4-cylinder feels merely adequate even at its best, although the highway fuel economy of 32 mpg is pretty solid. The 3.6-liter V6 offers up a lot more power and torque — 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft to be exact — but even then, the Equinox isn’t exactly a hot rod. Regardless of engine choice, power routes through a 6-speed automatic transmission to either the front or all four wheels (FWD, AWD), and both engines are happy running on regular unleaded.

In anticipation of a likely all-new Equinox next year, the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox rolls into this year relatively unchanged. There may be an element of “if it ain’t broke” there, since Equinox sales have been doing better and better over the years despite newer competition such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape. There’s also the ‘tweener size to consider; despite being priced alongside the Honda and Toyota, the Equinox is notably larger, about as long as a Ford Edge, for example. And, unlike those compact SUV competitors, the Equinox offers a V6 engine with 301 horsepower. Nonetheless, the Equinox is definitely a utility play, offering a roomy back seat and comfortable driving dynamics, but not really what we’d call “fun.”

From its diesel engine to its high-end Denali trim, the Canyon sets new standards.","ConsIf you need to tow more than 7,700 pounds, need maximum payload or prefer a truck with a proven track record, a full-size Sierra or Ford F-150 might be a better call. In the midsize-pickup segment, Toyota’s Tacoma delivers proven performance and better resale.",22000,"Driving the Used 2017 GMC Canyon Crew CabAn already enviable engine lineup gets even better this year as the 2017 GMC Canyon gains a new, direct-injection 3.6-liter V6 teamed with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Base models keep the reliable 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, while the torque-happy, high-mileage 2.8-liter diesel remains an option. Regardless of engine, the Canyon enjoys an exceptionally civilized ride, with handling that far exceeds what one might expect of a high-riding pickup truck. The steering is direct and responsive, and the suspension is able to absorb most road imperfections while still remaining stiff enough to deal with off-road adventures. GMC’s 2017 Canyon is tow-rated up to 7,700 pounds, a feat made easier by such features as trailer-brake control. From the driver’s seat, the view is pretty good, with tall comfortable seating and big windows all around. A standard rearview camera helps with parking and safety.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 GMC Canyon’s interior is a lot nicer than market expectations might have required, and it’s a fine blend of modern style with truck practicality. Most of the functions are in a big center stack, with large knobs that should be easily operated by gloved hands. Directly ahead of the driver are those instruments concerned with getting down the road. There’s ample center console storage, and the Crew Cab should handle four adults with decent comfort and five in a pinch. Upholstery materials include vinyl, cloth and leather, and there is a variety of available infotainment and audio systems.
Exterior StylingWhile admitting that style is subjective we will unapologetically submit that we think the Canyon looks great. Up front is a large, squared-off, big-rig-style grille that, even on this compact pickup, looks just right and makes an unmistakable linkage to the bigger GMC Sierra trucks. LED running lights and projector-beam headlights give a look of class. The fender openings are somewhat large, but that just means plenty of room for bigger tires or tire chains. Each end of the rear bumper includes what GMC calls the CornerStep, providing an easy way to step up and reach into the cargo bed.
Favorite FeaturesFIRST-IN-SEGMENT SAFETY Rare in this segment, GMC offers such driver-assist features as forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning. Beyond these, the Autotrac 4-wheel-drive (4WD) system’s 2-speed transfer case automatically shifts between 2- (rear)-wheel and 4-wheel drive as needed. DURAMAX TURBODIESEL ENGINE A first in the midsize-pickup segment, the 2017 GMC Canyon’s Duramax turbodiesel makes a modest 181 horsepower but a stump-pulling 369 lb-ft of torque. With all that torque, a Duramax-equipped Canyon can tow up to 7,700 pounds and is rated at 30 mpg on the highway, 22 mpg in the city.
Standard FeaturesEven the base 2017 GMC Canyon is surprisingly well-equipped, with standard features including a 4.2-inch screen, 6-speaker audio, power windows and door locks, power driver seat and rearview camera, plus the CornerStep rear bumper, cargo-box lighting and a locking tailgate. The SLE trim level adds an 8-inch touch screen for the infotainment system, cruise control, rear defogger, remote keyless entry, steering-wheel audio controls, fog lights, 17-inch tires and wheels and additional trim and convenience items. The SLT and Denali add even more, including automatic climate control, remote start, heated front seats (ventilated on Denali), rear sliding window and 18-inch wheels and tires.
Factory OptionsIn addition to the various upgrades associated with the trim levels, GMC’s Canyon midsize pickup for 2017 is available with numerous packages, among them a Convenience Package, SLE Convenience Package, All-Terrain Package (on SLE only) and one we strongly recommend for its safety benefits, the Driver Alert Package. The Autotrac automatic 4-wheel drive simplifies 2WD or 4WD operation. Other options include a Bose premium 7-speaker audio system, choices of wheels and tires and several items geared to off-roading adventures and/or extra storage racks for canoes or surfboards and the like. The Canyon’s options list is a long one.
Engine & TransmissionThe base GMC Canyon engine is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder with 200 horsepower and either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic; it’s ideal for work-truck applications. Next is an improved 3.6-liter V6 with 308 horsepower, available only with the 8-speed automatic and with all the power you could reasonably want. Both engines offer excellent combinations of power and economy. The 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel delivers 369 lb-ft of torque, a maximum towing capacity of 7,700 pounds and as much as 30 mpg on the EPA highway rating. We are tempted to recommend the turbodiesel except that, with a price premium of almost $4,000 over the V6, you’d drive a long time to make up the difference in fuel savings. Our pick has to be the V6.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2017, the GMC Canyon gains an improved direct-injection 3.6-liter V6 teamed with a new 8-speed automatic transmission. New trim levels include a Denali version, Terrain X package and Nightfall Edition. Teen Driver is now standard, and a new 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system is offered with select trims.
GMC’s 2017 Canyon pickup truck might be midsize on paper, but its looks, abilities and attitude seem pretty full size to us. A revised 3.6-liter V6 engine improves power and economy, while more trim and option packages give buyers even greater flexibility. With Ford’s Ranger still on the drawing board, the Canyon’s only real non-GM-related competition is the Toyota Tacoma or Nissan Frontier, neither of which can match the Canyon in the areas of towing, payload, engine choices and fuel economy (up to 30 mpg with the diesel options). Available with a choice of 5- or 6-foot beds and Extended or Crew Cab configurations, the Canyon comes perilously close to stepping on some full-size pickup toes, and that probably suits GMC just fine.

They start around $24,000 for King Cab 4-cylinder models, or about $25,500 if you want a V6-powered King Cab. The long-bed Frontier SL with 4WD starts around $38,000. While its starting price undercuts rivals, the Nissan’s pricing becomes more in line with the competition as you climb trims, though it’s still below that of a loaded Tacoma or diesel-powered Colorado or Canyon. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Frontier pickup truck. As the years go by, we expect the Frontier to hold its value well, but still not top that of the Tacoma.
Driving the Used 2017 Nissan Frontier Crew CabIn our test of a Crew Cab PRO-4X model, we found the new Frontier easy to maneuver and more agile and comfortable for the daily commute. Trucks this size are again gaining popularity, and the easier maneuverability in the city compared to a full-size truck is certainly one of the reasons why. On rough pavement, however, the Nissan’s PRO-4X off-road suspension could be harsh. We were impressed with the powerful 4.0-liter V6 engine, but not the resulting fuel economy. We averaged 15 mpg around town, which is outmatched by full-size trucks today. The Frontier’s outdated 5-speed automatic transmission is also at fault here. The interior offers one of the most comfortable driver’s seats and seating positions in the midsize-truck segment. We also like the dash layout, which is clean and simple, though dated. At speed, there’s wind noise from around the large outside mirrors. Engine and road noise intrude as well.
Interior ComfortExtremely comfortable, although dated and on the simple side, the interior of the 2017 Nissan Frontier is likable and versatile. Open the rear-hinged doors of the King Cab model and you’ll find a pair of cramped seats that are useful for children and short rides. However, if you plan on carrying passengers frequently, it’s best to opt for the Crew Cab model with its traditional doors and adult-sized 3-passenger bench. The rear seats on all Frontier models flip up for more space, and the front-passenger seat can fold flat, creating an impromptu workstation. Leather replaces cloth on higher trim levels.
Exterior StylingIn the age of oversized hulking grilles and chrome galore, the new 2017 Nissan Frontier may be a little conservative-looking for some. We find it to be attractive in a handsome, get-the-job-done kind of way. It’s simple-looking, but purposeful and it has a masculine quality all trucks should possess, especially in PRO-4X trim, which wears off-road equipment like chunky tires and skidplates, as well as available roof racks and crossbars. A long bed is available on Crew Cab models, giving it the same bed length as the smaller-cabin King Cab.
Favorite FeaturesNISSANCONNECT NissanConnect, like many modern systems, gives the new Frontier’s infotainment system a smartphone-like interface, complete with apps. Available with and without navigation, the Apps features allow integration with an iPhone or Android smartphone, further expanding the system’s capabilities. With navigation a small 5-inch touch screen is intuitive and easy to use.
 UTILI-TRACK BED-CHANNEL SYSTEM Unique and innovative when it first appeared, the Frontier’s Utili-track system uses a series of channels in the bed floor and bed side rails along with removable cleats, which slide into the channels, to provide a wide range of attach points to secure cargo. Accessories are also offered, including bed dividers.
Standard FeaturesMost buyers of the new Frontier will skip the least expensive King Cab S model with manual transmission. It’s a very basic truck lacking air conditioning, power windows and a radio. Getting an automatic on the S adds A/C, cruise control, an AM/FM/CD stereo and Bluetooth. However, if you want power windows and mirrors, or a USB-equipped audio system, you’ll have to move up to the more civilized SV trims, which also include NissanConnect with mobile apps such as Facebook, and streaming audio like Pandora and iHeartRadio. The Crew Cab SL adds leather seats, Rockford Fosgate audio and a standard V6 engine.
Factory OptionsFor 2017, Frontier SV models offer a popular package that includes an auto-dimming mirror, spray-in bedliner, Utili-track tie-down system, dual-zone climate control, an upgraded audio system and a rearview camera and sensors. The 2-wheel-drive (2WD) Desert Runner adds attitude as well as Bilstein off-road shocks and off-road wheels and tires, while the 4-wheel-drive (4WD) PRO-4X models add an electronic locking rear differential and skidplates. Crew Cab PRO-4X models offer a luxury package with leather seats and heated outside mirrors, while SL and SV models can get a power moonroof. Campers should check out the bed tent available from Nissan dealers.
Engine & TransmissionStandard on the 2017 Nissan Frontier King Cab models is a 152-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine. It comes with a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. A 4.0-liter V6 is available in King Cab and is standard in Crew Cab models or any 4WD Frontier. With a robust 261 horsepower it provides some scoot. With it, a 6-speed manual is standard and a 5-speed automatic is available. The 4-cylinder model is no slouch, offering a respectable tow rating of 3,500 pounds, and 2WD V6 models can tow up to 6,500 pounds. All 2017 Nissan Frontiers run on regular gasoline. Unfortunately, fuel economy trails far behind the new GM midsize trucks, with just 23-mpg highway for 4-cylinder models or 21/22 mpg for V6 versions.

The Jetta is also fuel-efficient, earning up to 40 mpg with a manual transmission.","ConsIf you want a small diesel car, you’ll have to look to Chevrolet, which plans one for the 2017 Cruze. If you want fun-to-drive alternatives, the Mazda3 makes a strong case, as does the Honda Civic. Need an all-wheel-drive compact car? See the Subaru Impreza or the VW Golf SportWagen.",18715,"Driving the Used 2017 Volkswagen JettaAll Jettas remain on the spry, fun-to-drive spectrum among compact sedans, and that attribute only intensifies as you climb trims. The Jetta S and SE models come with a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that delivers good acceleration and great efficiency, while the Jetta SEL uses a larger, 1.8-liter turbo-4 that has more punch yet still offers good fuel economy. The Jetta GLI is the most powerful variant with its 210-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo, and combined with its sport-tuned suspension can be thought of as a less-expensive Audi, the luxury-brand cousin of Volkswagen. Aside from invigorating engines, we appreciate the Jetta’s responsive steering and brakes, and smooth transmissions. Jettas have a taut but compliant ride, but the Jetta GLI with its stiffer suspension and larger, 18-inch wheels can be harsh.
Interior ComfortThe Jetta 5-passenger sedan offers good interior space, though rear legroom can’t quite match that of the Toyota Corolla. At 15.5 cubic feet, the Jetta’s trunk is as big as that of a midsize sedan. The Jetta’s interior feels minimalist and clean, with DNA from its European cousin Audi. We like small touches such as the adjustable armrest between the driver and passenger that comes on all but base models, and the 1-touch power operation for all four windows. Unlike competitors, genuine leather seating isn’t offered — just V-Tex Leatherette. All Jettas come with a simple-to-use touch-screen audio system.
Exterior StylingAs with its sleek yet minimalistic interior, the 2017 Jetta’s exterior styling favors quiet sophistication over swooping lines, a massive grille or — heaven forbid — a giant rear spoiler. This is European subtlety, clean and simple. We’re rather fond of this approach, and while the Jetta may not scream, ""Look at me,"" we wager it will stand the test of time better than a fair share of its rivals. Jetta GLI models can be spotted via their unique front fascia with a red line running across the grille, red brake calipers and a small rear spoiler built into the trunk.
Favorite FeaturesGLI For drivers seeking a cure for the boring sedan, the Jetta GLI is welcome medicine. In addition to sporty manners, the GLI brings the most standard equipment in the Jetta’s lineup, including advanced safety and driving aids, and a premium audio system.
 1.4T TURBOCHARGED GASOLINE ENGINE This powerplant recently replaced the dated, 115-horsepower 2.0-liter engine formerly used in Jetta base models, and the car is far better for it. This thoroughly modern engine grants a great balance of power and efficiency.
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Jetta lineup has been reduced to four trims: S, SE, SEL and the top-line, performance-oriented GLI. At its most basic, the Jetta includes a turbocharged engine, 5-speed manual transmission (automatic is optional), rearview camera, 6-way driver’s seat with height adjustment, and 16-inch wheels. Infotainment is provided by a 5-inch color touch-screen system that incorporates AM/FM/CD player with SD and USB ports, and Bluetooth phone connectivity. For $3,000 more, the SE model includes power sunroof, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, larger touch-screen display with phone app features, faux leather seating, push-button start and premium wheels.
Factory OptionsAside from a 6-speed automatic transmission that’s standard on SEL models, most extras in the 2017 Jetta sedan are had by climbing trims. The SEL also includes a more powerful engine, power driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation system, rain-sensing windshield wipers and forward-collision warning system with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Top-line GLI models add a still-more-powerful engine, sport-tuned suspension, 400-watt Fender premium audio system and the Park Pilot front and rear parking-sensor system.
Engine & TransmissionWith the demise of the diesel and hybrid powertrains for 2017, the latest Jetta is offered only with turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engines. On the upside, whichever of the three you choose is easy to recommend. Jetta S and SE models use a 1.4-liter, SEL models have a more powerful 1.8-liter, and the GLI goes larger (and more powerful still) with a 2.0-liter. All Jettas are front-wheel drive. S and SE models come with a 5-speed manual transmission, but most buyers will opt for the 6-speed automatic, which is standard on the SEL. The manual transmission on Jetta GLI models is a 6-speed. Though VW notes that the max power figures seen below are achieved via premium gasoline, all the engines are fine drinking regular unleaded.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2017, the Jetta lineup loses its diesel and hybrid offerings, and has been trimmed to four trims. Even base models now get a rearview camera standard, and the blind-spot monitoring safety system is standard starting on Jetta SE models.
Like other vehicles in Volkswagen’s 2017 lineup, the Jetta compact sedan returns with something of a limp. That’s because, as with other models, the once-desirable diesel models are not being offered in the wake of the German automaker’s emissions-cheating scandal. VW optimistically says the Jetta’s trim lineup has been ""simplified,"" with the former hybrid model also being shown the door. Still, what remains has some appeal. All 2017 Jettas are powered by turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engines, ranging from a small 1.4-liter in lower models to the potent 210-horsepower 2.0-liter in the performance-oriented Jetta GLI. The Jetta stands out from rivals like the venerable Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic with European character and spry manners, but its uphill battle against those stalwarts just got steeper.

It can seat four comfortably (no, really), and it’s thrifty on gas. And we think this year’s styling updates look good.","ConsThe Versa Note is not particularly quick, and thanks to its soft suspension, it’s not even fun in a drive-a-slow-car-fast kind of way. If you want at least a little thrill in your subcompact, check out the Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta or Chevy Sonic.",16300,"Driving the Used 2017 Nissan Versa NoteFor those seeking a 4-wheel motorized transportation appliance, the 2017 Nissan Versa Note should be more than sufficient. It offers a comfortable ride, good fuel economy, a roomy interior and a reasonable price. On the road, the 109-horsepower 4-cylinder engine delivers adequate acceleration without using much fuel, and the ride is comfortable. But when compared to cars like the Honda Fit and Ford Fiesta, the Versa Note comes up short. Where those cars are fun, such as in corners, the Note leans hard and gives up grip easily. The engine works through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), which helps fuel efficiency, but also means at full throttle it drones loudly; this year’s added ""shift"" points mitigate that somewhat, but there’s no getting around the noise when you floor the gas. The good news is that once underway the Versa Note moves along just fine.
Interior ComfortThere’s a surprising amount of room inside the 2017 Versa Note, despite the small exterior dimensions. The rear seat, for example, offers 37 inches of legroom, more than the two-sizes-bigger Nissan Altima sedan. Its cargo area can swallow 18.8 cubic feet with rear seats up, or up to 38.3 with them down. As for style, the interior accommodations are pretty basic, yes, but it’s all very functional and comfortable as well. The front seats offer good support, and the controls are all easy to use and find.
Exterior StylingWhile the cabin may be virtually identical to the Versa sedan, the Versa Note’s exterior is notably different. It’s dimensionally different, thanks to much shorter front and rear overhangs, giving it a sportier look. We especially like the new nose, which incorporates the ""V-Motion"" grille treatment we’ve seen on cars like the Nissan Altima and Sentra in recent years. From a practical standpoint, the tall profile means it’s easy to get in and out, and the wide rear doors make it easy to install a child seat.
Favorite FeaturesAROUND VIEW MONITOR You’d think such a small car wouldn’t need a 360-degree view to help maneuver, but somehow it makes sense, allowing you to maneuver the Versa Note into even smaller spaces than you’d imagine without worry.
 FUEL ECONOMY The Nissan Versa Note may not be quick, but its small engine and CVT combine for very good fuel economy, up to 39 mpg on the highway.  
Standard FeaturesThe base 2017 Versa Note S Plus is a little thinner on standard equipment than we might expect, even at its low base price. There’s air conditioning, plus power mirrors, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/Aux audio system, tilt wheel, trip computer, Bluetooth, front disc/rear drum brakes, and 15-inch steel wheels with covers. The CVT is standard, and the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder is the only engine available. However, missing from the standard-equipment list are power windows, power door locks, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver’s seat, or even a remote trunk release, though all are available on the higher-priced SV trim.
Factory OptionsLike most cars these days, options come with successively higher trim levels, rather than stand-alone packages. The next-step SV adds power windows and door locks, a USB input for the audio system, keyless entry, cruise control and a rearview camera. The SR offers aluminum-alloy wheels and a sportier exterior appearance that includes fog lights, while the top-line SL adds push-button ignition, a touch-screen audio system with navigation, and the around-view monitor system. Stand-alone options include premium paint colors, and an SV Appearance package that adds aluminum wheels and fog lights to that model.
Engine & TransmissionThe only engine available for the 2017 Nissan Vera Note is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 109 horsepower. That’s not a lot by today’s standards, and it’s connected to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that’s tuned for fuel economy, not performance; last year’s base-model 5-speed manual has disappeared. The upshot is that if you’re looking for a budget race car, you’ll be disappointed. However, if you’re looking for a powerful-enough commuter, the Versa Note’s 39-mpg highway rating will definitely keep you interested.

The 2017 Nissan Versa Note is a hatchback version of the Versa sedan, sharing the 4-door’s engine, suspension and dash, although the last is dressed up a bit in the Note.

The hatchback looks more upright, with shorter front and rear overhangs, and a redesigned nose and tail this year that enhance the sporty appearance.

Though most people will need a stopwatch to tell the difference in acceleration, the 8-speed does make finding that power easier. Around town or on the highway, the suspension is set up to be smooth and creamy; if you’re hoping for a sharp-handling midsize SUV, you’ve come to the wrong place. Truth is, most people want that comfortable ride, and they’ll be perfectly happy with the Highlander’s blend of control and smoothness, even in the “sporty” new SE model. The Highlander Hybrid also benefits from the new V6, and with a combined total of 306 horsepower, it’s actually the hot-rod of the Highlander family. Go ahead and ignore the 4-cylinder model, as its meager fuel savings aren’t worth the sacrifice in power.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Toyota Highlander interior is largely the same as last year, with the exception of additional USB ports, new seat upholstery, and a few other selective trim upgrades. That’s fine with us, as the Highlander’s interior is one of its strong points. The comfortable front- and 2nd-row seats are great for long drives, and little ones in the third row will be satisfied, although adults should skip it. The dash-width shelf up front is perfect for your wallet, smartphone, keys or whatever else, and the huge center console bin can easily swallow anything too big for the shelf.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Highlander’s grille is huge, following the big-grille trend that’s been stylish for the past few years. Yet it emphasizes the already blunt nose of this midsize SUV, with different models getting different trims, seeming to shrink the headlights in the process. The rest of the Highlander is pretty much untouched, although the new Highlander SE gets a blackout trim package that tones down the grille and ultimately looks pretty good. The styling updates further embolden a design that was already a departure of sorts from the Highlander’s bland predecessors, and although the grille won’t appeal to everybody, it’s certainly distinctive.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM
“DON’T MAKE ME COME BACK THERE!” becomes a whisper, thanks to the Highlander’s Driver Easy Speak system. This intercom lets your voice be heard loud and clear even in the third row, making driving a shout-free affair, to the benefit of everyone’s stress levels (therapeutic screams notwithstanding).
FLIP-UP REAR HATCH WINDOW
Whether you need to retrieve or add a single item from the cargo area without the dog escaping, or if you just need to grab that pickle jar so it doesn’t smash on the pavement when you open the hatch, the Highlander’s flip-up rear glass is the gift that keeps giving.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2017 Highlander LE still comes with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, a combo good for fuel economy but not much else. However, it also comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense Plus (TSS-P), which bundles high-tech safety gear like active cruise control, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, and lane-departure alert and warning. There’s 8-passenger seating, standard rearview camera, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, day/night rearview mirror, and three 12-volt auxiliary power outlets (two up front and one in the second row), and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display with Toyota’s Entune audio system, Bluetooth and voice recognition.
Factory OptionsMost options are added by trim level; the LE Plus adds 3-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen display and faux-leather seats; the XLE gets real leather and better infotainment that includes navigation; Limited and Limited Platinum get even better audio systems, heated and ventilated front seats, and even an around-view camera, heated steering wheel and heated 2nd-row seats in the Limited Platinum. A panoramic moonroof is available, plus rear-seat entertainment including Blu-ray and DVD, Driver Easy Speak, and of course the V6 or Hybrid powertrains.
Engine & TransmissionThree basic powertrain choices face 2017 Highlander buyers. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there’s the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, including hybrids, but unless you need the extra traction for foul weather, we suggest skipping it in favor of the better fuel economy you get from front-wheel drive (FWD).

A thorough refresh keeps the 2017 Toyota Highlander ahead in a very tough game. Under the hood, a new V6 engine puts out more power and connects to a new 8-speed automatic transmission.

If that extra capability isn’t what you need, the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer or Nissan Pathfinder offers more savings at the pump.",31800,"Driving the Used 2017 Dodge DurangoStick with the standard 295-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine and 8-speed automatic on the 2017 Durango, and you might be pleasantly surprised. It can haul up to 6,400 pounds, but it’s also smooth and refined, and the 8-speed automatic is a good match, even if it occasionally hunts for the right gear. But, let’s face it, the real attraction is the 360-horsepower Hemi V8. Not only does it sound great at full throttle, it offers seriously quick acceleration and passing power, plus it can tow up to 7,400 pounds. There’s no disguising the Durango’s size and weight compared to competitors like the Toyota Highlander, but the rear-wheel drive (RWD) and careful suspension tuning help the Durango feel sportier than you might expect. That goes double for R/T models, which offer a downright stiff ride. Interior noise levels are quite low, and all three seating rows are admirably comfortable.
Interior ComfortYou’d be forgiven for thinking the 2017 Dodge Durango was in a higher-priced category than its competitors. That goes double for Citadel models with their heated and ventilated front seats, and heated 2nd-row seating. Keep the 2nd-row bench if you need 7-passenger hauling, or opt for the captain’s chairs to make the third row more easily accessible if you’re using child boosters. There’s only so-so cargo space behind the third row, but that row folds flat, and you can even flip the front-passenger seat down to accommodate long objects. New this year is a hand-laid dash pad, and ""platinum chrome"" trim.
Exterior StylingIn front, the 2017 Dodge Durango boasts LED highlights under the projector-beam headlights, and in back is a cool LED spanning the entire rear end, giving the Durango its signature ""racetrack taillight"" display. The new GT model replaces the Limited’s chrome with a monochromatic theme, but fans of the bright stuff can still opt for the SXT or especially the Citadel. The Blacktop package returns on GT and R/T models, featuring 20-inch gloss-black aluminum-alloy wheels, crosshair grille and Durango badges, along with black headlight bezels. R/T models also get more body-colored trim, as well as the R/T’s lower ride height.
Favorite FeaturesDURANGO R/T There’s no SRT model, but the 2017 Durango R/T comes close. With 360 horsepower from the V8 and a lowered suspension that maximizes grip from the 20-inch wheels and tires, the Durango R/T is one of the most agile SUVs at the price.
 ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL The Durango’s comfortable suspension, roomy interior and excellent audio system beg for a road trip, and its available Adaptive Cruise Control — part of the Technology Package — makes it even easier by automatically slowing when needed, and even tightening the gap in slower traffic so you don’t get cut off. 
Standard FeaturesFor 2017 the Dodge Durango SXT comes standard with seating for five passengers, the 3.6-liter V6 engine with start/stop technology, and a Sport mode to enhance the driving experience. There’s also the standard Uconnect infotainment system with its AM/FM/CD radio, WMA/MP3 support, Bluetooth, Sirius satellite radio and auxiliary input jack. You also get 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, fog lights, heated power-side mirrors, and 3-zone automatic climate control, along with a tilt/telescope steering column. Different models have different levels of standard equipment, with the top-line Durango getting a power liftgate and sunroof, navigation, Nappa leather seats, and more.
Factory OptionsThe 2017 Durango seems infinitely customizable, from the optional 3rd-row bench and 2nd-row captain’s chairs, to V8 power, 4-wheel drive, and more. Beyond that, there’s an upgraded 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system with navigation, and an LCD multifunction display between the main gauges. Option packages include the Blacktop package, and a Brass Monkey appearance package that features 20-inch bronze wheels. Other options include a rearview camera, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, power sunroof, power hatch and automatic-dimming high beams. If you’re going to tow, get the 220-amp alternator, heavy-duty engine oil cooler, Class IV hitch receiver and load-leveling rear shocks.
Engine & TransmissionWe’re big fans of the 3.6-liter V6 that’s standard in every 2017 Durango, except the R/T. With 295 horsepower the V6 has no problem accelerating, and the start/stop system helps save a bit of fuel in the process. Of course, there’s also the 5.7-liter Hemi V8, with 360 horsepower and towing capacity of 7,400 pounds. It’s also relatively fuel-efficient thanks to a fuel-saver mode that seamlessly deactivates four of the eight cylinders when full power is not required. Both engines are mated to a standard 8-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is available across the board. Note that the fuel-saving mode gives the new Durango competitive fuel-economy numbers. Some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy numbers, due to changes in EPA testing.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Durango Limited model disappears in favor of the new, monochromatic 2017 Durango GT. Among the interior upgrades are a hand-wrapped soft-touch instrument panel, and Platinum Chrome interior accents. One particularly clever new feature: viewing trailered items while moving using the 8.4-inch Uconnect screen.
The SUV is to the 21st century what station wagons were to the 20th, thanks to their do-it-all combination of passenger, cargo and towing capabilities. The 2017 Dodge Durango arguably takes it all a step further, offering the big SUV capability one expects in something like a Chevy Tahoe, but in a smaller package designed to compete against the Honda Pilot, GMC Acadia or Toyota Highlander. The 2017 Durango gets a new model level, with the new monochromatic GT replacing the chrome-laden Limited as the volume model. It all adds to a package that offers an available V8, up to 7,400 pounds of towing capacity, and creature comforts like active cruise control with full stop, and a 10-speaker Beats by Dre audio system.

And the new Sport model adds more power and improved handling. Higher-grade Limited models offer class-exclusive features such as power-operated trunk, Infinity audio and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.","ConsFor all of the Elantra’s enhancements, it still can’t match the fuel economy of a Honda Civic or Mazda3, nor is it as roomy as a Civic or Toyota Corolla. If you want an Elantra Hatchback, one is still available in the GT, but it’s based on an older model.",18000,"Driving the Used 2017 Hyundai ElantraThe 2017 Elantra does an admirable job blending comfort, efficiency and even some agility, particularly in the new Sport model, with more power, a firmer suspension, and bigger brakes. . The standard Elantra’s new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine feels stronger than its 147 horsepower may lead you to believe, and its available 6-speed automatic transmission is a willing partner. The Sport’s 201-horsepower 1.6-liter turbocharged four inspires more urgency to acceleration. Romping around the hills outside of San Diego during an extensive evaluation, we enjoyed the sport mode that firmed the Elantra’s steering feel and held shifts longer. On a more recent blitz from Las Vegas through Death Valley, we were very impressed with the Sport’s high-speed stability. While not as athletic as a Mazda3, the Elantra holds its own against other compact sedans for general commuting and city driving, while the Elantra Sport adds a level of performance and agility previously absent in this car.
Interior ComfortHyundai points out that the Elantra’s interior is a size higher than its class. It’s a compact car, but its 110.2 cubic feet of interior room makes it a midsize vehicle, according to the EPA. That’s not quite as roomy as the also-all-new Honda Civic and revised Nissan Sentra, but it still means a small car needn’t be a ""penalty box."" We especially appreciate the driver-centric dash, and the fact that the audio and climate controls are buttons and knobs vs. multi-step touch-based systems. We also like the more supportive seats and D-shaped, leather-wrapped steering wheel in the Sport model.
Exterior Styling Like Hyundai’s latest Tucson compact SUV and Sonata sedan, the new Elantra looks more conservative than its predecessor, but also more sophisticated than its price suggests. It’s not gaudy, either, though we admit the large hexagonal grille is borderline gaping. The Elantra further stands out with an athletic stance, front-wheel air curtains, and a spoiler built into the trunk lid. All of the foregoing is accentuated in the Sport model, which also rolls on 18-inch wheels. The 2017 Elantra is only marginally larger than the outgoing model, growing 0.8 inches in length to 179.9 inches, and an inch in width to 70.9.
Favorite FeaturesPOWER PACKAGE The Elantra Sport is a complete package — suspension, chassis, brakes — but the key is its 201-hp 1.6-liter turbo four and 6-speed manual transmission, borrowed from the midsize Hyundai Sonata. Transmission options also include a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, but the manual is the better choice.
 POWER TRUNK, WITH A TRICK The 2017 Elantra is the first mainstream compact sedan to offer a power-operated trunk, a feature made even more convenient thanks to its hands-free operation. With the key fob in your pocket or purse, all you have to do is walk behind the car, wait a few seconds, and the trunk will open.
Standard FeaturesEven the most basic 2017 Elantra includes air conditioning, power windows and door locks, a 6-way driver’s seat with height adjustment, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and AM/FM/CD audio with USB and auxiliary jacks. If you go with an Elantra SE, do yourself a favor and get the Popular Equipment package. For only $800, it adds a slew of features like a 7-inch touchscreen display, backup camera, Bluetooth, cruise control, hood insulation for a quieter ride, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. All you lose in the deal is the CD player. All new Elantras come with a generous 10-year/100,000-mile warranty for the powertrain and five years of roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsAside from the automatic transmission ($1,000), most major options for the new Elantra are bundled into packages or the higher Limited trim. The Elantra Limited includes a leather interior, power driver’s seat with lumbar support, hands-free power trunk, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, and push-button start. Adding the Tech package to that trim includes navigation with an 8-inch screen, Infinity audio, heated rear seats, and a power sunroof. Go for the Ultimate package, and you’ll get automatic emergency braking, smart cruise control, lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, the driver’s seat memory system and high-intensity headlights that turn in the direction of the steering.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 Elantra offers a choice of three 4-cylinder engines, all new to the model. The standard powerplant is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that’s slightly more powerful and efficient than the outgoing 1.8-liter engine. It is mated to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. A 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic propels the Elantra Eco trim. As you probably guessed from the name, the Eco is the most efficient of the three, raising this version of the Elantra up to the magic 40-mpg highway mark. The new Elantra Sport brings 201 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque to the party, with EPA ratings of 22/30 mpg (city/highway) with the 6-speed manual transmission, 26/33 with the 7-speed automatic.

This compact sedan has new 4-cylinder powertrains, impressive safety features like blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. The Elantra hatchback GT remains available, but carries over on a separate platform.
The revamped 2017 Elantra marks the sixth generation of Hyundai’s compact sedan, and it returns in prime form to battle against other best-selling rivals like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra. As with the rest of Hyundai’s lineup, the Elantra boasts stylish looks, premium amenities and a class-leading warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. The standard 2017 Hyundai Elantra has a good blend of refinement, eager driving manners and efficiency, while a forthcoming Eco model promises even greater fuel economy.

Plus, if fate requires, the non-hybrid Rogue does offer a 7-passenger/3rd-row option which is understandably tight, but serviceable for young kids.","ConsWhen the time comes to sell, the Rogue isn’t expected to hold its value quite as well as the resale leaders: Subaru Forester, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and the new Kia Sportage. If you need your small SUV for regular towing, the Rogue will likely lose out to the Ford Escape.",24760,"Driving the Used 2017 Nissan RogueThe driving personalities of the two Rogues are fascinatingly similar, though not identical. The new hybrid powertrain’s 176 horsepower isn’t a significant boost over the non-hybrid’s 170, but the immediate response supplied by the Hybrid’s battery gives it crisper low-end performance from stoplights. Both Rogues cruise, play and park with the same ease and unfussiness that’s always made it an easy crossover SUV to own. It should also be noted that the Rogue Hybrid’s city fuel economy is significantly better than the non-hybrid Rogue.
Inside the cabin, sound-absorption improvements make the 2017 Rogue competitive in class at keeping the sounds of the outside world outside. Likewise, the Rogue’s ride quality is a strong suit. Never one to make an art out of corner-carving at quick speeds, Nissan’s small SUV prefers a more relaxed approach to driving, an attitude that’s very consistent with the folks shopping this segment.
Interior ComfortThe Rogue’s already stylish interior — attractively illuminated instrumentation, quality materials and soft-touch surfaces — is now accented by a thick, fully-adjustable flat-bottom steering wheel and new trim on the dash and door inserts. Its NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” front seats — leather-clad in SL models — are supportive and comfortable. Legroom and headroom are good in the first and second rows, with an EZ-Flex 40/20/40-split 2nd-row bench seat that tilts and slides fore and aft in non-hybrid models. Cargo room for the non-hybrid Rogue is generous, less so in the hybrid, but the seats fold nearly flat, despite the battery’s location behind the second row.
Exterior StylingExterior changes to the 2017 Rogue maintain its aerodynamic strength and youthful appeal. A meatier “V-motion” grille treatment, edgier headlights and bumper design, along with “boomerang” taillights, give the Rogue a look more in line the rest of the Nissan SUV family. Nissan now offers a motion-activated power rear liftgate with the Rogue. Standard on SL models and optional on SVs, the power liftgate responds to a kick-motion beneath the rear bumper to power the liftgate open or closed.
Favorite FeaturesNEW ROGUE HYBRID
The new Rogue Hybrid boasts fuel-economy numbers that eclipse every other hybrid SUV on the market. Better still, the Rogue Hybrid’s execution results in a summertime pleasant driving experience (as long as you don’t expect V8 performance) that’s easy to roll-on off the line and maintain at freeway speeds.
AROUND VIEW MONITOR
Nissan’s available 360-degree Around View Monitor uses cameras to give you a brilliant bird’s-eye view of your Rogue’s position, helping the driver easily fit into tight parking spots, as well as avoid objects that might otherwise result in a collision.
Standard FeaturesThere are few surprises in the standard equipment of the base Rogue S: basic audio with Bluetooth phone/streaming and USB, a 5-inch color display, a rearview camera, EZ-Flex seating, and the flexible Divide-n-Hide rear-cargo-storage system. Value comes into play on the Rogue SV models. SV highlights include a power-adjust driver’s seat, 6-speaker audio, heated front seats and outside mirrors, dual-zone climate control, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alerts, plus privacy glass and roof rails. If you can wallet up to a Rogue SL, you’ll enjoy leather seating, Bose audio, NissanConnect with 7-inch touch-screen navigation, the Around View monitor, a heated steering wheel, and the motion-activated power liftgate.
Factory OptionsWhile options for the 2017 Rogue S model are negligible, you can get many of the best standard Rogue SL highlights in SV option packages. Likewise, an SL model can be enhanced with options packages. The SL Premium Package has a power panoramic moonroof, LED headlights and the essential safety of forward emergency braking. Choosing the SL Platinum Package acquires 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and the peace-of-mind of Intelligent Cruise Control and forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, plus lane-departure warning and prevention. Last and highest, the SL Platinum Reserve Interior reupholsters your Rogue SL in exclusive tan leather with quilted inserts and unique stitching.
Engine & TransmissionNissan’s adequate 170-horsepower inline-4 carries over in the 2017 Rogue, and is joined by the Rogue Hybrid’s fuel-pinching gasoline/electric hybrid setup. Both configurations send power to the driven wheels via Nissan’s Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission with driver-selectable Normal, Sport and Eco modes. The Rogue Hybrid is capable of automatically shutting off the engine and just running on the SUV’s compact lithium-ion battery in order to keep the vehicle’s fuel-economy numbers healthy.

Read Full Review","What's New?2017 is the year that the Rogue becomes Nissan’s bestseller. To help ensure that goal, Nissan is introducing a hybrid version of its compact SUV, and giving the Rogue an exterior and interior refresh. At the top of the Rogue line, several new premium and safety features await.
As the most capable foot soldier in Nissan’s army, the 2017 Nissan Rogue holds its own with strong sales against the class-leading small SUVs, the Honda CR-V (all-new for 2017) and the Toyota RAV4. Refreshed and refined for 2017, Nissan’s compact-crossover SUV adds a very well-mannered and fuel-efficient hybrid model to the mix, and enhances the luxury and safety offerings at the upper trim levels. In addition to front-wheel drive (FWD), the Rogue offers all-wheel drive (AWD) at every level. And while the Rogue doesn’t own hard cornering like a Mazda CX-5, or tow like the new Ford Escape, it more than excels in its day-to-day excellence.
Used 2017 Nissan Rogue PricingThe pricing structure for the 2017 Nissan Rogue is very direct: S (base), SV (more standard features — this level is our strongest recommendation), and SL (top-of-the-line).

Also, those base prices are low, but they rise quickly as you add options.",17300,"Driving the Used 2017 Kia ForteLet’s just get this out of the way first: Despite the available 201-horsepower engine available in the Forte5, this subcompact doesn’t have the sporty chops to back up its looks. Enthusiasts should check out the Mazda3, Honda Civic SI, or Volkswagen Jetta or GTI for their fix. However, for the other 99 percent of drivers who just want a comfortable, feature-filled and sporty-looking sedan, coupe or hatchback, the Forte lineup is a solid choice. Around town and on the highway, the Forte sedan and hatchback are all excellent choices. Multiple creature comforts coddle driver and passenger alike, and even the base engine feels plenty powerful; the turbo is just gravy. The sedan’s added driver-assist technologies like automatic braking and lane departure warning sweeten the deal on a solidly economical daily-driver choice.
Interior ComfortThe interior doesn’t look much different this year, retaining the logical controls and comfort, plus the whimsy of the passenger-side dash ripples. The soft-touch dash is exemplary of the overall quality of materials inside. EX models get standard leather this year, and there’s also heating and cooling available, as well as a 10-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support. Even the rear seat offers a center armrest with cup holders, as well as a good amount of room for the class. Then there’s the Forte5’s excellent 23 cubic feet of cargo space, in case the sedan’s 15-cubic-foot trunk isn’t enough.
Exterior StylingThe new grille and headlights on the 2017 Kia Forte look like they’re straight from the bigger Kia Optima sedan. Ditto for the taillights, which retain the original shape, but have been redesigned to look more like the larger car’s. The Forte5 shares the same nose, but keeps its unique hatchback profile, obviously. Overall, it’s a fresh and good-looking group of cars. The LED accent lights are a nice touch, and even with the updates, the overall conservative aesthetic remains, as do features like power-folding exterior mirrors, puddle lamps and illuminated door-handle pockets.
Favorite FeaturesAPPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO Android Auto and Apple CarPlay bring the functionality and interface of your smartphone to your car’s infotainment system. Just plug your phone’s USB cable into the car’s port, and you’re set, bringing your phone’s navigation, music, texting and other compatible apps to your car’s dash.  FORTE5 HATCHBACK While the Kia Forte5 may not have the sporting chops of the Volkswagen GTI, we’re just glad Kia has remained committed to this small but fanatical market niche. 
Standard FeaturesThe new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder base engine in the Forte sedan/Forte5 hatchback offers the same power as last year’s 1.8-liter but better city fuel economy with the popular automatic transmission. All Forte sedan and Forte5 hatchback models come with keyless entry, standard Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, air conditioning and a split-folding rear seat. The base LX model Forte sedan is fairly dressed down, even offering steel wheels and a manual transmission. A new mid-level S model sedan offers nicer interior appointments at a lower price than the EX. A full complement of active and passive safety features is standard on every Forte.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2017 Kia Forte lineup include navigation, leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control and Kia’s UVO infotainment system. Most of that’s included in the Forte’s Premium Plus package, although leather is now standard on EX sedans. Many features are bundled by trim level, and the Forte5 models offer a level above the sedan called SX that adds a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 201 horsepower, as well as 18-inch wheels. A Technology Package adds navigation, heated and cooled seats, and other niceties like a power moonroof.
Engine & TransmissionThe new base engine for the Forte and Forte5 is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. Those numbers are essentially the same as last year’s smaller engine, but this engine gets notably better city fuel economy. It’s standard in the LX and S models of the Forte sedan. The other 2.0-liter engine is a direct-injection 4-cylinder that puts out a more robust 164 horsepower, which is slightly down from last year. Transmission choices in the sedan are a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. The Forte5 gets just the more powerful 2.0-liter, while the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder can be paired with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.

The 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine is an efficiency leader rated at 40 mpg on the highway, and the high-performance ST and RS offer awesome power and performance.","ConsAs appealing as it is, Ford’s 2017 Focus can’t match the low price and content of the Kia Forte, Nissan Sentra or Chevy Cruze. The only all-wheel-drive model is the high-performance Focus RS, which starts around $36,000, and if you’re seeking a coupe or wagon, you’ll have to look elsewhere.",36000,"What's New?Changes to the Ford Focus for 2017 are minimal. There’s a new SEL package that includes 17-inch aluminum wheels with black sections, fog lights, black headlight bezels and a power moonroof. There’s also a new color called White Gold.
Offering a wide assortment of trims (S, SE, SEL or Titanium), powertrains and price ranges, the 2017 Ford Focus sedan and hatchback compete in the crowded compact segment against such highly rated rivals as the Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and Honda Civic. Fresh styling, along with Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system and a sporty driving character are hallmarks to the popularity of the Focus, as is turbocharged horsepower. It starts with the extremely fuel-efficient 123-horsepower 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine in the SE. Then there’s the tire-scorching 252-horsepower Focus ST and the incredible 350-horsepower all-wheel-drive (AWD) Focus RS. If green is more your thing there’s also an all-electric Focus that challenges the Nissan Leaf and Volkswagen e-Golf and offers about 80 miles of range.
Used 2017 Ford Focus PricingA base 2017 Focus S sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $18,000. Hatchback variants are slightly more. The performance-oriented Ford Focus ST hatchback starts just over $25,500. The all-electric Focus EV hatchback starts right around $30,000, while the new RS pushes the price to just under $37,000. Unlike some electric cars, the Focus EV is available in all 50 states, and incentives can potentially be worth thousands of dollars. Prices on most Focus models are in line with those of rivals such as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla sedans, but remain more expensive than base versions of the Kia Forte and Mazda3. Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Focus. The Focus’ resale value has traditionally been fair, but below leaders such as the Subaru Impreza and Honda Civic.
Driving the Used 2017 Ford FocusThe 252-horsepower Focus ST is Ford’s VW GTI-killer, and it’s quite an impressive piece of work: fast, fun and comfortable. Although when equipped with the optional Recaro seats, anyone with more than a 30-inch waist may find himself wedged in place. The new high-performance 350-horsepower all-wheel-drive Focus RS is nothing short of the new benchmark in the hot small-car market, which also includes the Subaru WRX. It’s a rocket ship that still delivers the practicality of a 5-passenger hatchback. Most will like the ride delivered by the SE trim, which can be nicely loaded up and still remain well below $25,000. The Titanium brings even more bells and whistles, but its larger tires and sport suspension create a rather firm ride. The standard 160-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in the S Sedan and SE sedan or hatchback is strong. Stopping power is impressive across the line, even the base model.
Interior ComfortFord’s 2017 Focus compact comes with a host of interior upgrades to enhance usability. For example, there’s a small cubby and USB port ahead of the shifter, perfect for your phone. The climate controls and steering-wheel buttons are easy to use, and the blue backlighting is both stylish and easy on the eyes. Optional features like a heated steering wheel help the Focus stand out in this segment, and ample sound-deadening helps make the Focus one of the quietest cars in its class. Unfortunately, the Focus’ rear-seat head- and legroom are now surpassed by a number of newer competitors.
Exterior StylingIts sleek, raked windshield and tastefully flared fenders give the new 2017 Ford Focus a substantial look that belies its price. The sedan is attractive, but the hatchback is the real looker. And it’s more versatile. Both can be outfitted with wheel-and-tire packages ranging from 15-inch steel wheels on the Focus S to 215/55 tires with 17-inch aluminum rims on Titanium models; Titanium models also offer an 18-inch wheel package with a sport-tuned suspension. The hot ST model and red-hot RS both wear aerodynamic enhancements that announce their intentions but don’t break out the bullhorn. They look racy but not ridiculous. 
Favorite FeaturesSYNC 3 Ford consistently improves its Sync infotainment system and the 2017 Focus is equipped with the latest and greatest version. Not only is it easier to operate, it has a large 6.5-inch touch screen. It’s much better than the version it replaced, which was marred by too-small alphanumerics and latent response.
 ECOBOOST ENGINES The Focus offers three different smooth and powerful turbocharged engines: a 123-horsepower 1.0-liter 3-cylinder designed for maximum fuel economy, a 252-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder designed for maximum fun, and a 350-horsepower 2.3-liter monster for hard-core enthusiasts. But as is usual with turbocharged engines, lead-footed driving can run up fuel consumption. 
Standard FeaturesAll 2017 Ford Focus models come standard with MyKey, a feature that allows owners to limit maximum speed and other settings for young drivers. Other standard features for the Focus S include air conditioning, a tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless remote entry and an AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio. SE models get standard Sync with MyFord Driver Connect, cruise control, a folding rear seat, rearview camera and 16-inch tires on alloy wheels. Titanium models add leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, 10-speaker Sony audio, push-button starting, and Sync 3 with MyFord Touch; Focus Electric models get eco-fabric seat covers and voice-activated navigation.
Factory OptionsFord’s new Focus benefits from several option packages. SE models can be equipped with the Sport Package, which adds exterior styling enhancements, paddle shifters for the automatic transmission, revised suspension settings and 17-inch wheels. Also available are a blind-spot-warning system and lane-keeping system. Focus SE buyers can also order the economical 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine for maximum fuel economy. Additionally, Ford’s Sync AppLink is available, allowing Focus drivers to interact with more than 60 AppLink-enabled apps on their phones through the car’s Sync technology. Active Park Assist, handling and winter packages, and navigation are also available.
Engine & TransmissionMost Focus models use a 160-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic. On the SE with Sport Package and Titanium models, the automated-manual transmission adds SelectShift paddles. To take fuel economy to the next level, the 2017 Ford Focus can be equipped with a turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine. Dressed in its most frugal form, the 3-cylinder Focus SE is rated at 40 mpg in highway driving. Focus Electric models get a 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motor and a range of about 75 miles. The 2017 Focus ST uses a 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine that makes 252 horsepower and is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, while the RS gets a 350-horsepower 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine and standard all-wheel drive.

However, it’s backed up with all-American V8 muscle, and cloaked in styling that’s among the best we’ve ever seen from Detroit.","ConsAll this sophistication talk is about the Camaro’s chassis dynamics. Inside, the hard plastics and curious ergonomic choices are not up to the same standard. Additionally, the rear seat would have to be bigger just to be tiny, and the view out the narrow windows is tough; claustrophobics, stay away.",27300,"Driving the Used 2017 Chevrolet CamaroLet’s get this out of the way now: No, we haven’t driven the 2017 Camaro ZL1, but with 650-horsepower supercar-grade performance, suffice to say we’re excited. Part of that excitement is because we already know how fundamentally good this Camaro is. Smaller and much lighter than its predecessor, it’s much more nimble and lively from the moment you take the wheel. That sophisticated feel extends to every model, be it the turbocharged 4-cylinder, the V6, or the V8 SS model. The 8-speed automatic transmission offers slick shifts and paddle shifting, enhancing the fun-to-drive quotient rather than diminishing it. If you prefer to row your own, there’s a solid 6-speed manual transmission available. Balancing out the go is some serious whoa in the form of Brembo brakes, which are standard on the V8-powered SS. It comes together in a car offering the driving sophistication of a European luxury-sports sedan, for considerably less money.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Camaro interior is a combination of clever touches, cool styling and occasionally so-so materials. The clever touches include climate controls that reduce dash clutter by using the trim rings around the center vents to control temperature and fan speed. The design integrates classic and modern elements seamlessly. The seats offer great support in corners, and the touch-screen infotainment system incorporates Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, hampered somewhat by a too-reflective screen. The materials used are still not up to the level of the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger. We’ve ignored the rear seat, and after one glance, you will too.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Chevrolet Camaro sports clean, tight lines to go with its tidy dimensions, owing a little to the classic 1969 model, but really more of an update to the previous-generation Camaro. Regardless, there’s a lot to like. We love the impossibly thin headlights, aggressive fenders and low-slung roof. Camaro ZL1 models get a deep grille and bumper to feed that hungry engine, and the 1LE looks equally stunning with unique mesh grille inserts and a front splitter, plus a satin-black hood. Unfortunately that cool low roofline results in narrow windows that make it nearly impossible to see out the back.
Favorite FeaturesCAMARO ZL1What’s not to love? The 2017 Camaro ZL1 combines the amazingly powerful engine we already love in the Corvette Z06 with the Camaro’s excellent chassis dynamics. With 0-60 mph in about 3.5 seconds, and the quarter mile flashing by in just 11.4 seconds at 127 mph, it’s supercar performance for $62,000.
4-CYLINDER TURBOAnd here we are on the opposite end of the performance spectrum. The 4-cylinder doesn’t offer nearly the power of the V8, but its 275 horsepower ain’t bad. Couple that with up to 31 mpg on the highway, and it’s the ultimate cake-and-eat-it-too solution.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2017 Chevy Camaro is the 1LT, which comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. There’s also a driver-selector mode that includes Snow and Ice, Tour and Sport. The 7-inch touch-screen audio system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual USB ports, aux input, and GM’s 4GLTE Wi-Fi hotspot technology. Bluetooth, automatic climate control, and a color driver-information display between the main gauges are all standard. Upscale features include push-button start and keyless entry, power driver and passenger seats, and a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel. Multiple airbags and advanced stability control help keep you safe.
Factory OptionsOptional engines include, of course, the 335-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 on LT models or the 455-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 in the new Camaro SS. Other choices are an 8-speed automatic, two different Brembo-brake upgrades, an upgraded audio system with a larger touch screen, and an enhanced driver-information center similar to the Corvette’s. The Camaro SS adds available magnetic ride-control suspension, power sunroof, in-dash navigation for those times when your iPhone doesn’t have a signal, and a dual-mode exhaust system. That doesn’t even include the 1LE track package for both LT and SS models, and of course the 650-horsepower Camaro ZL1.
Engine & TransmissionWith the Camaro ZL1 there are now four engines available for the 2017 Camaro. There’s the standard 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with a muscular 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Step up to the 3.6-liter V6, which offers more power but less torque than the 4-cylinder, and offers cylinder deactivation for better fuel economy. But a Camaro needs a V8, and in the Camaro SS there’s the 6.2-liter V8 pumping out 455 horsepower. Step up to the Camaro ZL1 and you’re looking at a 650-horsepower supercharged version, making it the most powerful Camaro ever. All engines connect to either a 6-speed manual that includes automatic rev matching on V8 models or an 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters; Camaro ZL1 models get an optional 10-speed automatic.
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 275 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm 295 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000-4,500 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/31 mpg (automatic), 20/30 mpg (manual)

Read Full Review","What's New?Aside from the hoopla surrounding the Camaro’s 50th anniversary — look for ""Fifty"" badges everywhere — two models join the lineup. First is the Camaro 1LE, a track-ready package that pares the car down to its essentials. The Camaro ZL1, with its 650-horsepower V8, is for the purely power-hungry.
The 2017 Chevrolet Camaro transcends its muscle-car roots, becoming something altogether new: a sports coupe so sophisticated you’d think it was born in Europe. That’s because this is basically the Chevrolet version of the Cadillac ATS, a car that happens to be one of the best-driving cars GM has ever made. This newfound maturity is fitting, as this year marks the Chevy Camaro’s 50th anniversary. Along with the word ""Fifty"" plastered on every model, Chevrolet is introducing two new high-performance models: the Camaro 1LE for the track-day enthusiast, and the 650-horsepower Camaro ZL1 aimed at those for whom too much is never enough. Whether you choose the 4-cylinder turbo, V6, V8, coupe or convertible, the 2017 Chevy Camaro gives the Ford Mustang night sweats.

AWD is available with either a manual or automatic transmission.","ConsIf you’re looking for a soft ride, soft seats and fuel economy in the 40-plus mpg range, you’re better off with a hybrid hatchback like the Toyota Prius V. Although AWD is offered on the SportWagen, VW’s wagon lacks the ride height and off-road ability of the Subaru Outback wagon.",25000,"Used 2017 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2017 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen starts low, with the 5-speed-manual-equipped TSI S just under $22,500. An automatic transmission adds $1,100 to the price of any SportWagen, while AWD adds about $2,250. We think the mid-level SE grade offers a solid mix of standard and available features for just under $28,000. A loaded SportWagen SEL with every option costs about $34,000. Not cheap, but it’s hard to find a better-equipped or more fuel-efficient people-and-things hauler at the price. Of course, you want a good deal, so check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see how much people in your area are paying for the new SportWagen. As for resale, 2017 VW Golf SportWagen looks to be holding only average values, well below those of the Subaru Outback, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. The SportWagen’s low values are likely due to fallout from the diesel-engine scandal.
Driving the Used 2017 Volkswagen Golf SportWagenSharing its suspension and engine with the Volkswagen Golf makes the 2017 VW Golf SportWagen one fun little machine. The 1.8-liter TSI turbocharged 4-cylinder may not look like much on paper, but it delivers its power smoothly throughout the rev band, and is especially willing when power is needed for passing or merging. Although we love that VW offers a manual transmission, this one is a bit rubbery and vague. The DSG automatic is a much better choice, offering nearly identical fuel economy and still allowing the option of choosing your own gears. We found the SportWagen’s ride to be on the firm side, as are its seats, and the suspension is tight enough to allow some very rapid high-speed maneuvers through twisting turns with very little evidence of torque steer. The available 4Motion AWD is a great feature, but why only on the base S trim, VW?
Interior ComfortLike the rest of the current-generation Golf family, the 2017 Golf SportWagen gets high marks for its interior. Materials use and fit and finish all look like they’re from a higher class of car. Comfortable seating includes the rear seats, which offer decent legroom and headroom, even for taller passengers. The generous cargo area doesn’t result in any additional road noise, as is often the case with wagons. We’re not hugely fond of the touch-screen infotainment system, although having Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is a nice upgrade. Even the cloth seats on the base S trim are stylish and handsome.
Exterior StylingFrom head-on, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the new SportWagen from any other Golf. From the side, of course, it’s a different story, with the long roof and upright hatch giving the 2017 VW SportWagen a distinctively European look. Surprisingly, it’s not much bigger than the regular Golf. The wheelbase — the distance between the front and rear wheels — remains the same, and overall length grows only a few inches. Options include bi-xenon headlights with LED accents, and they give the SportWagen a distinctive and upscale appearance.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER ASSISTANCE PACKAGE Standard on the SEL and available on SE, the Driver Assistance Package brings such helpful driver assists as forward-collision warning, autonomous braking, lane-departure and blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic detection.
 REMOTE SEATBACK RELEASE Why every hatchback and wagon doesn’t offer this feature is beyond us. However, once you’ve experienced the joy of being able to lay flat the rear seats from the back of the vehicle, you’ll probably be asking the same question.
Standard FeaturesThe base model VW Golf SportWagen S for 2017 comes pretty nicely equipped. For starters, the SportWagen TSI gets standard 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a 5-speed manual transmission, cloth seats, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, rearview camera, heated side mirrors, air conditioning, cruise control, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob and handbrake lever. The standard touch-screen audio system includes eight speakers, Bluetooth, a CD player, SiriusXM satellite radio, and Volkswagen’s Media Device Interface to connect your smartphone via Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or MirrorLink. The S 4Motion gains heated front seats. Safety equipment includes front, side and curtain airbags, and hill-hold assist.
Factory OptionsOptions are mostly divided among trim levels. Higher-level Golf SportWagen models (SE and SEL) get a standard automatic transmission. SE equipment also includes 17-inch wheels, heated front seats, keyless entry and ignition, corner-illuminating fog lights, panoramic sunroof and a Fender audio system. SEL models add upgraded leather seats with 12-way-power adjustment for the driver, automatic climate control, navigation and the Driver Assistance Package. A lighting package for the SEL includes bi-xenon headlights with LED running lights, while the SE offers the Driver Assistance Package that adds adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitor and a forward-collision warning system with autonomous braking.
Engine & TransmissionStandard issue on the 2017 VW Golf SportWagen is Volkswagen’s 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. Known as the TSI, this model is available with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, and puts out 170 horsepower to both front- and all-wheel-drive (FWD, AWD) models.
 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 170 horsepower @ 4,500 rpm 199 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/35 mpg (FWD, manual), 25/34 mpg (FWD, automatic), 22/30 mpg (AWD)

The rarity and heavenly powertrain are practically icing on the cake.","ConsMaserati dealerships are rare, meaning getting your Italian coupe serviced could be a hassle, especially considering its less-than-certain reliability history. There’s also a distinct lack of modern safety options and technology. More modern competitors like the Porsche 911 and BMW 6 Series offer more in all three areas.",135000,"Driving the Used 2017 Maserati GranTurismoThe 2017 Maserati GranTurismo is a delight for all the senses. The thrilling acceleration provided by the Ferrari-built 454-horsepower V8 engine offers an accompaniment of an exhaust howl that sends chills up your spine and a smile on your face. It’s like Pavlovian conditioning for car enthusiasts. A 6-speed automatic transmission is the only one offered, but its seamless operation proves no impediment to the thrills of this grand touring machine. In Normal drive mode, the Skyhook suspension quells road imperfections in a way that makes it the ideal Italian sports car for loafing along the coast. Switch to Sport mode to change the GranTurismo’s attitude to a more aggressive posture. We love the feel of the direct, hydraulic-assist steering, and the race-bred Brembo brakes (6-piston in front) erase speed with confidence. As sharp and responsive as it is, the GranTurismo always maintains a sense of grace, polish and refinement.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 GranTurismo’s front and rear bucket seats are separated by a center console, and the front seats power forward to ease access to the surprisingly usable rear seats. The triple-insulated power-convertible top on the drop-top GranTurismo deploys in just 24 seconds, at speeds up to 20 mph, and rear rollover bars pop up to protect occupants in case of a crash. Special Edition models get unique seats with red contrast stitching and red tridents embroidered on the headrests, carbon-fiber trim, and that special-edition plaque. The trunk is big enough for two golf bags, or a couple of overnight bags.
Exterior StylingEven though the Maserati GranTurismo has been around for nearly a decade, the design isn’t dated thanks to the classic Pininfarina lines. Its long hood and short rear deck with its integrated spoiler give it a classically sporty look, and the projecting grille and trident logo are equally classic Maserati. Special-edition models incorporate Extracampionario Grigio Lava paint on coupes and Extracampionario Rosso Italiano red paint on convertibles. Other special touches include a carbon-fiber hood painted the same color as the rest of the car, exterior carbon accents like the front splitter, door handles and mirrors, and specially painted brake calipers.
Favorite FeaturesTHE SPORT BUTTONFrom the looks of it the 2017 Maserati GranTurismo should be sporty enough, but with a press of the Sport button you open up the exhaust, quicken the shifts and sharpen the Skyhook adjustable suspension for a firmer ride and sharper handling.
SHIFT PADDLESLots of cars come with shift paddles these days, but few have the Italian flair and design as the ones behind the steering wheel of the GranTurismo. And here, art meets science as the paddles shift gears with a simple click.
Standard FeaturesThe ""base"" 2017 GranTurismo is the Sport, while the base convertible model is simply known as the GranTurismo Convertible. All of them, regardless of model, come with a Ferrari-crafted engine, 20-inch wheels and Brembo performance brakes. There is also an interior awash in leather, a power-operated soft top on convertibles, and amenities like a navigation system, Bose surround-sound system, integrated HomeLink garage-door opener, and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Convertible models also include an automatic rollbar-deployment system.
Factory OptionsOne area where the GranTurismo shows its age is in modern amenities such as blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or radar-based cruise control, none of which are available on the Maserati. You can’t even get a rearview camera even though a color navigation system is standard equipment, although front and rear parking sensors are offered. The multiple models increase the luxury and/or sport levels, and being an Italian luxury car, you can also get unique paint colors, various wood or carbon-fiber accents, and interior/exterior treatments. GranTurismo MC models are more performance-oriented with lower and stiffer suspension and aerodynamic enhancements.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine available for the 2017 Maserati GranTurismo: a Ferrari-built 4.7-liter V8 work of art. With 454 horsepower (444 in base convertible models) routed to the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission, it’s especially intoxicating when the exhaust system’s bypass-valve opens above 3,000 rpm. The gas-guzzler tax is proof that fuel economy took a back seat to smooth, responsive and strong power delivery. The GranTurismo’s 6-speed automatic transmission also offers a Sport mode for quicker shifts, a Manual setting for full manual gear selection via steering-column-mounted paddle shifters, and even an Ice mode for low-grip situations, forcing the transmission to start in second gear.

Read Full Review","What's New?Maserati celebrates 60 years of grand touring cars with a limited edition of the 2017 GranTurismo. Limited to 400 units — including a numbered plaque — the special edition gets interior and exterior styling enhancements and is available as a coupe and convertible.
With its Italian good looks and V8 engine, the 2017 Maserati GranTurismo makes a statement about success and taste you can’t get in a Porsche 911, BMW 6 Series, or even the more expensive Bentley Continental and Aston Martin Vanquish. It starts with dramatically sweeping lines that could only come from Italy. Under the long hood is a V8 engine built by none other than Ferrari, and with 454 horsepower, it delivers on the promise made by the design.

With the 2017 GMC Yukon SUV the feeling is eerily reminiscent of the full-size American luxury cars of the past, only with better handling, braking and steering response. The mechanical twin of the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban, the 2017 Yukon SLE and SLT trims offer the same 5.3-liter V8 and 355-horsepower rating. Move to the Denali, however, and you’ll get a 6.2-liter V8 unique to the GMC family, with 420 horsepower on tap. Denali trims also employ Magnetic Ride Control, a system that features self-adjusting shock absorbers that continually adapt to changing road conditions for a uniform ride over any surface. Inside, the Yukon’s luxurious interior makes it easy to relax on long trips, especially if you’re not doing the driving.
Interior ComfortStepping inside the 2017 GMC Yukon, particularly the Denali, will quickly inform the owner that this purchase was money well spent. The artful and flowing shapes are enticing, materials are first-rate, the control layout is easily accommodating and detailing is impeccable. The seats are invitingly comfortable, and the second row offers space for full-size adults. In the Yukon the third row is best for the kids but, in the longer XL, there’s room for grown-ups. Those 3rd-row seats fold flat into an elevated floor that slightly diminishes vertical cargo space, something you won’t find with the Ford Expedition or Nissan Armada.
Exterior StylingFor years GMC SUVs have been styled as if they were passenger-carrying versions of the brand’s Sierra pickups. No more. Thankfully, the Yukon gets its own face, and a bold one it is. The non-Denali and Denali models share the same sheetmetal, but Denali versions have an upscale chrome mesh grille. For all 2017 GMC Yukons, it’s an in-your-face look that will not be mistaken in the corporate officers’ parking lot, and a good dose of chrome adds the scent of money.
Favorite FeaturesLUXURIOUS INTERIOR  Beyond soft-touch points and copious leather trim, the 2017 GMC Yukon’s interior has an aesthetic that is superior to SUVs from Toyota, Ford or Dodge. Just about every creature comfort has been thoughtfully added, making the Yukon’s interior one of the nicest in this class.
 6.2-LITER V8 Big SUVs full of people and gear require big power, which is why the Yukon’s 6.2-liter V8 pumps out a robust 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. You’ll pay a penalty at the pump, but in truth the fuel-economy difference from the 5.3-liter V8 is miniscule.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2017 GMC Yukon SLE offers more standard features than the Chevy Tahoe LS, but it’s also more expensive. The standard-equipment list on all Yukons includes front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, and IntelliLink, with an 8-inch-diagonal touch screen, AM/FM/SiriusXM, Bluetooth streaming audio and a host of other features. The SLT adds leather, heated and ventilated front seats, power-folding 2nd- and 3rd-row seats, the Enhanced Driver Alert Package, a hands-free liftgate and numerous convenience items. The Denali adds the 6.2-liter V8, upgraded interior, Magnetic Ride Control and no small amount of on-road respect.
Factory OptionsGMC’s 2017 Yukon SUV is one of the few vehicles still available with a front bench seat, giving nine seating positions. The SLE can be equipped with the Enhanced Driver Alert Package and a Convenience Package that brings a power liftgate, power adjustable pedals and remote garage-door opener. The Yukon SLT and Denali models are available with the Open Road Package, which includes navigation, rear-seat entertainment, a power sunroof and additional SiriusXM service; the sunroof by itself is $995. The Denali also offers a wide selection of wheels, up to 22 inches.
Engine & TransmissionAs standard equipment 2017 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL models have a 5.3-liter V8 of 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The highly appealing Denali has a take-no-prisoners 6.2-liter V8 of 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Both engines feature the efficiency benefits of direct gasoline injection and Active Cylinder Management, which seamlessly shuts off half the cylinders during steady cruising. Even with these efficiency-enhancing technologies, all Yukons are big vehicles and, therefore, are decidedly not gas-savers. Still, the engines are strong, capable and well-proven, and will get the jobs done. All Yukons and Denalis can be 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive (2WD, 4WD), the latter with an off-road-appropriate low range.

Improvements are made to GM’s IntelliLink and rear-seat entertainment systems, and low-speed automatic braking is added to the Enhanced Driver Alert Package (standard on SLT and Denali).
In the world of full-size family SUVs, the 2017 GMC Yukon stands head and shoulders above the rest. The Yukon, with its longer sibling, the Yukon XL, is more modern in design than the aging Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia, yet its abilities are in full view, reminding all competitors that this slick big rig is still a workhorse at heart. While SLE and SLT trim get by with a 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8, the Denali trims are equipped with a 420-horsepower 6.2-liter unit that knows no equal in this class. And while it’s true the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator can tow more weight, neither can match the Yukon’s cutting-edge styling, driver assists or optional technology features.

With models ranging from the most basic 2-wheel-drive (2WD) Laredo to the performance-oriented 475-horsepower SRT, and a tow rating up to 7,400 pounds, the Grand Cherokee offers something for everyone.","ConsIf off-road adventuring isn’t really your thing, you can find any number of front-wheel-drive, 5-passenger SUVs for less money than a loaded 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Need a third row? You’ll have to look to the Nissan Pathfinder, Honda Pilot or Ford Explorer.",31300,"Driving the Used 2017 Jeep Grand CherokeeWhile Jeep loves to portray its 2017 Grand Cherokee SUV tackling all manner of off-road adventures, the truth is many will rarely see more than a few gravel-strewn or snow-covered roads. For this reason, Jeep wisely equips the Grand Cherokee with a civilized suspension that is remarkably comfortable both on and off-road. Regrettably, the Grand Cherokee’s rugged design can’t cheat the wind, and noise emanating from around the side mirrors and windows is evident, although we doubt many people who covet the big Jeep will care. The Grand Cherokee’s excellent ground clearance and choice of various 4-wheel-drive (4WD) systems give consumers plenty of off-road possibilities, as do the powerful standard V6 and optional V8 engines. The 3.0-liter EcoDiesel offers impressive torque and 30 mpg, but its nearly $5,000 premium and pricey urea refills (required every 10,000 miles) make it a hard choice to justify.
Interior ComfortJeep’s 2017 Grand Cherokee spans from a reasonably comfortable SUV to one capable of giving some luxury brands a run for their money. All models are 2-row/5-passenger configurations — there is no 3rd-row option. This layout offers good room for passengers and a healthy 36.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats. Folded, that space expands to 68.3 cubic feet. Base Laredo models look the part with cloth, manually adjusted front seats, but stepping up just one trim brings power operation to the driver. Higher-end models are awash in leather and feature heated and ventilated front seats.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee has a muscular, handsome design. True to its off-road intent, the GC has 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with the performance-oriented SRT model sitting slightly lower. The Trailhawk gets distinctive red tow hooks, an anti-glare hood decal and 18-inch off-road wheels. Most Grand Cherokees receive a redesigned 7-slot grille, while higher-end models feature extra chrome. Despite its tall profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, but you can opt for the power-operated liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesUCONNECT ACCESS
Jeep’s Uconnect infotainment system is one of the best in the industry. An 8.4-inch touch panel displays large, easy-to-see graphics, and the system’s voice-recognition software allows for control of the navigation, audio, hands-free texting and mobile apps such as Pandora.
QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION
Jeep’s new Grand Cherokee SUV offers an optional air suspension with five separate height settings. At its highest, the Grand Cherokee delivers 10.6 inches of ground clearance. At its lowest setting, entry and exit are made easier and aerodynamics is improved. Trailhawks get a modified version for improved wheel articulation.
Standard FeaturesAs mentioned, the least expensive Grand Cherokee for 2017, the Laredo, still requires drivers to manually adjust their seat, but does come with dual-zone climate control, a digital instrument cluster, rearview camera and parking sensors, keyless entry and a 6-speaker audio system with a 5-inch touch screen. For less than $5,000 more, we recommend stepping up to at least the Laredo 75th Anniversary Edition, which includes the 8.4-inch Uconnect system, heated and power-operated front seats, heated steering wheel, auto-dimming rearview mirror, rearview camera with backup sensors and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsThe Jeep Grand Cherokee’s Quadra-Trac I 4WD system is optional, and a must if you intend to go Jeeping in your Jeep. The Quadra-Lift air suspension plus the top-spec Quadra-Drive II 4WD system are essential for any hard-core off-roader. The standard halogen headlights are so-so at best, so the optional xenon setup is a better bet. In a true sign of the times, a CD player has been relegated to the options list. Other options: a Blu-ray entertainment center, dual-pane sunroof and 19-speaker harman/kardon audio system, plus blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning with crash mitigation and lane-departure warning.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee is offered with several engine choices. There’s the standard 3.6-liter V6, which offers good power and fuel economy. The 5.7-liter V8 amps up the power noticeably, but fuel economy suffers. On the flip side, there’s the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6, which offers the most torque of any engine save the SRT’s V8 and gets great fuel economy. The Grand Cherokee SRT is a completely different animal. With a 475-horsepower 6.4-liter V8, its standard 4WD system is meant for the street, not the trail, proven by its 4.8-second 0-60-mph time. All Grand Cherokees come with an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. Two-wheel-drive (2WD) models are now only available with V6 engines, while 4WD is optional on all models and standard on the SRT.

The Trailhawk includes Quadra-Drive II, a unique air suspension, 18-inch off-road wheels and tires and an electronic limited-slip differential.
As the flagship model for the iconic Jeep brand, the 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV carries a heavy responsibility. Thankfully, with models ranging from basic to brutal, this 5-passenger SUV has the goods to stay one step ahead of rivals like the Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. And, with the exception of Toyota’s 4Runner, few other SUVs in this class can go where the Grand Cherokee feels most at home. The Grand Cherokee also has a luxurious side that allows the Summit trim to challenge premium SUVs such as the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE. With two powerful V8 engines and a diesel V6 option, Jeep’s Grand Cherokee for 2017 certainly feels like a premium brand, although its price tag may say otherwise.

As the least expensive Porsche, the Macan is also one sweet ticket into the prestigious brand.","ConsThough a sub-$50,000 starting price is a deal for a Porsche, it’s still a stretch for an entry-level SUV. If you want a bargain-performance SUV, look to the oft-overlooked Infiniti QX50. If you can compromise on the performance aspect, the Mercedes-Benz GLC and the Macan’s Audi Q5 cousin are great alternatives.",50000,"What's New?The 2017 Macan lineup doubles with the performance-oriented GTS that slots between the Macan S and Macan Turbo, while a new base model arrives with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. New standard features include lane-departure warning and front/rear parking assist with rearview camera. Apple CarPlay compatibility also becomes available.
The 2017 Porsche Macan is a small SUV blessed with the German luxury automaker’s invigorating driving dynamics. Better viewed as a tall, all-wheel-drive (AWD) hatch than rugged off-roader, the Macan is aimed at those seeking SUV functionality and sports-car performance. While there is a slew of rivals in the burgeoning compact-luxury SUV segment, the Macan is among the few that can back up its performance claims. With a new, sub-$50,000 4-cylinder base version, Porsche will surely attract even more buyers facing temptation from the likes of the all-new Jaguar F-Pace and the Maserati Levante. But with prices that can zoom past $80,000 for a Turbo model, the Macan remains a pricey proposition.
Used 2017 Porsche Macan PricingWith the new 4-cylinder Macan, price of entry into the lineup — and the Porsche brand — has dropped to $48,550, Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). That’s nearly $5,000 less than last year’s Macan S, which now starts at $55,450. The 2017 Macan GTS opens over $68,000, and the Macan Turbo jumps to over $77,000. At these prices, the Macan is among the priciest of the compact-luxury vehicles. The Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC and BMW X3 start several thousand below a base Macan, as does the new Jaguar F-Pace, which aims to give the Macan its most serious competition yet. Another new kid on the block, the Maserati Levante, starts over $70,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Macan’s resale value is expected to be great. In fact, last year’s model won the Best Resale Value Award in its class.
Driving the Used 2017 Porsche MacanLike its bigger brother the Cayenne, the 2017 Macan is among the sportiest SUVs. It is a Porsche, after all, even if it’s in the form of a sport-utility vehicle. Even the ""slowest"" model is fast, with the new 4-cylinder Macan able to rush to 60 mph in just over 6 seconds. The Macan S and GTS shave another second off that time, while the range-topping Macan Turbo goes 0-60 mph in as little as 4.4 seconds. Not all that long ago, that was 911 territory. Like any other Porsche, velocity is only part of the formula. Road-hugging grip, a brilliant 7-speed PDK automatic transmission and the sensory growl of the exhaust make the Macan a Porsche through and through. The always-on AWD system optimizes traction in both wet and dry conditions, while an off-road button optimizes the Macan for lighter off-highway adventures by varying torque distribution and throttle response.
Interior ComfortThe Macan has a 2-row, 5-passenger configuration. Porsches have long offered a variety of color combinations, and this one’s standard upholstery is leather or suede-like Alcantara. The front seats engulf you and range from standard 8-way power-adjust comfort versions to 18-way sport variants. The array of buttons surrounding the gear shifter could rival those in an airplane cockpit. The view out is IMAX wide. Second-row legroom is stingy, however. In back, the 17.7-cubic-foot cargo floor expands to 53 cubic feet by dropping the 40/20/40-split/folding 2nd-row seatbacks. That compares poorly to SUV competitors like the BMW X3 and Audi Q5.
Exterior StylingProfiled to look a bit like a 3/4-scale Cayenne, the 2017 Macan’s tidier proportions are more akin to a tall hatchback than a compact SUV. It’s not snap-recognizable as a Porsche, either. All trims of the Macan boast bi-xenon headlights and fog lights, while the GTS and Turbo models have unique, more aggressive front fascias. GTS models have a matte-black finish on the side blades and a more dynamic color scheme. They also sit 10mm lower than Turbo models. The Macan Turbo, meanwhile, can be identified via its front spoiler lip and squared-off quad exhaust outlets.
Favorite Features80-PERCENT 911, 20-PERCENT CAYENNE, 100-PERCENT PORSCHE Porsche’s Style VP Michael Mauer bristles at the suggestion that the Macan is a baby Cayenne. He sees it more as “a big brother to the Porsche 911.” One lap around an enclosed track proves Mr. Mauer is not prone to hyperbole.
 7-SPEED PDK AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION While many tout their car’s horsepower and torque, performance potential is a moot point if the transmission can’t effectively manage the output. Porsche’s 7-speed dual-clutch automatic has no such issue, using the first clutch to hold the selected gear while the second clutch stands ready to instantaneously engage the next. 
Standard FeaturesThe new 2017 Macan base model cost thousands less than the Macan S (the former starter) but still comes nicely equipped. On hand are tri-zone climate control, lane-departure warning system, rearview camera with front and rear parking assist, power-folding side mirrors, power-operated liftgate, and 18-inch wheels. A fresh infotainment system is highlighted by a 7-inch multi-touch screen with AM/FM/HD/satellite radio with CD/DVD player, USB/aux inputs and Bluetooth connectivity. In addition to a more powerful V6 engine, Macan S model also have rain-sensing windshield wipers and tinted and thermally insulated glass.
Factory OptionsMore powerful still, GTS models have 20-inch wheels, suspension setting and other performance upgrades, while the top-line Macan Turbo boasts navigation, Bose audio, Alcantara roof lining, adaptive seats and active suspension. Option packages range from a sweet Burmester audiophile system to a panoramic roof, and Porsche Connect Plus module with wireless Internet access, Google Earth integration and Apple CarPlay, plus a rear-entertainment system and heated/ventilated front seats. Customization options abound, as do performance upgrades that include Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus, $8,150 carbon-ceramic brakes and the recommendable Sport Chrono Package with Sport Plus mode, launch control and dash-mounted analog/digital stopwatch.
Engine & TransmissionThe new base model is the first Macan to use a 4-cylinder, a turbocharged 2.0-liter that makes 252 horsepower, enough to zip this performance SUV from 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds (or 6.1 with the Sport Chrono package). At just over 3,900 pounds, this is also the lightest Macan. All others use a twin-turbo V6 engine — a 3.0-liter in S and GTS models and a larger 3.6-liter in the Turbo. All Macans use a 7-speed PDK automatic transmission and are all-wheel drive. For better fuel efficiency, they have an auto start/stop system that switches off the engine at traffic stops. Start-ups can be abrupt, and thankfully the system is defeatable. A V6 Macan can tow up to 4,409 pounds. 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Macan) 252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,800 rpm 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/25 mpg

This big sedan can round corners with confidence yet delivers a smooth ride, excellent braking and communicative steering response. The Avalon’s interior is as roomy and comfortable as some large luxury models, and even tall passengers will find the rear seats to be quite accommodating. Move to the Avalon Hybrid and you’ll find equally impressive acceleration, although the hybrid’s softer suspension feels less inclined to tackle mountain roads with gusto. However, you’ll find no quibbles with the 40-mpg-city fuel-economy figure. The Avalon’s navigation and infotainment systems are logical and easy to use, and the standard driver assists and safety equipment are formidable. Beyond mere numbers, the 2017 Toyota Avalon exudes a sense of solidity and quality, comfort and safety that makes it the envy of the industry.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Toyota Avalon sedan offers perhaps the finest cabin in its class, with first-rate materials, user-friendly controls and impressive fit and finish. The general design is the same regardless of trim level, which only sweetens the Avalon’s attractive $34,000 starting price. Toyota’s latest batch of infotainment options such as advanced voice recognition, mobile application integration and hard-drive-based navigation should appeal to tech-savvy buyers. The Avalon’s capacitive-touch switches for the audio and climate-control functions are responsive and straightforward. In terms of comfort the rear-seat passengers are treated to an abundance of legroom and headroom.
Exterior StylingThe Avalon’s masculine stance and sculpted bodywork were conceived by Toyota’s Southern California-based Calty Design studio. The forward-raked C-pillar and sweeping roofline impart an almost coupe-like silhouette. Although it seems counterintuitive, this aggressive design actually improves rear-seat headroom. The headlights incorporate a pair of stylish square-shaped projector lenses, which Toyota calls Quadrabeams. This contemporary look is finished off with a set of 17-inch or optional 18-inch alloy wheels, LED taillights and dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets.

Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 Toyota Avalon sedan gets its motivation from the tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6 or new Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder hybrid powerplant — the same system used in the latest Camry Hybrid. The conventional engine churns out a healthy 268 horsepower through a 6-speed automatic gearbox, while the hybrid system sends its 200 horsepower to the front wheels via a gearless continuously variable transmission.

Once the mainstay of the American family, the full-size sedan is now relegated to a smaller market. These ranks seek out a soft, luxurious ride but have no need for the tall ride height or fuel-thirsty appetite of a large crossover SUV. For them, Toyota builds the 2017 Avalon sedan, a proven commodity with a stellar reputation for reliability, performance, safety and fuel efficiency. Larger than the Kia Optima, Ford Fusion and Honda Accord, the Avalon offers limousine-like rear-seat accommodations and, in the 2017 Avalon Hybrid, delivers better fuel economy than some compact cars. And while competitors like the Buick LaCrosse and Chrysler 300 offer the option of all-wheel drive, neither can match the Avalon’s impressive resale or customer loyalty, although Buick is getting close.

Even if all-wheel drive isn’t important, the sharp styling, available hatchback body and cutting-edge technology may convince you.","ConsThe Impreza is not a particularly quick car, owing in part to the additional weight of its standard all-wheel-drive system. Fuel economy, though good, falls short of the best in its class, like the Honda Civic.",19200,"Driving the Used 2017 Subaru ImprezaCompared to its predecessor, the first thing you’ll notice about the 2017 Subaru Impreza is the quiet, a credit to the new architecture’s refinement. Beyond that, there’s the quicker and more responsive steering, which gives the new Impreza a livelier feel from behind the wheel. The suspension varies depending on what model you choose, but even the mid-level Impreza Premium provides surprising grip; step up to the Impreza Sport and the car’s new chassis makes the most of the lower-profile tires. One downside is power: The 2.0-liter engine puts out 152 horsepower, but it has more than 3,000 pounds of Subaru to lug around, and it never feels sporty. The new continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is smooth and quiet, and its paddle shifters imitate a 7-speed traditional automatic, but enthusiasts will gravitate to the 5-speed manual, or hold out hope for a more powerful engine in the future.
Interior ComfortThe interior has been thoroughly redesigned yet will be familiar to Subaru fans. Subaru designed the logically laid-out gauges, infotainment and controls to look far more upscale than you’d expect for a car with a base price that’s less than $20,000. Top-notch materials include soft-touch surfaces, and a classy stitched look on the dash and doors. The comfortable front seats are complemented by rear seats that finally offer decent legroom for adults. Cargo space in the Impreza sedan is a smallish 12.3 cubic feet; the hatchback’s 20.8 cubic feet of cargo space expands to 55.3 with the rear seats folded.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Subaru Impreza is longer, lower and wider than its predecessor, and the styling reflects its new proportions without exaggerating any of it. The grille and headlight treatments immediately mark this car as a Subaru, and some of the surfacing details still look like an Impreza. But the long roof and coupe-like shape of the sedan are much more modern and eliminate the stubbiness of the old car’s lines. Hatchback models make up 60 percent of Impreza sales, and the new one is a looker. For the first time, sedans as well as hatchbacks have built-in attachments for roof racks.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD ALL-WHEEL DRIVEMaybe a little on the nose for a favorite Subaru feature, but you won’t find this kind of all-weather peace of mind at a lower price. And this is a sophisticated system, with torque vectoring on higher-end models that makes the most of your traction, no matter the road conditions.
EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSISTSubaru’s EyeSight driver-assist technology uses stereo cameras to literally look down the road and observe things like other cars for active cruise control and collision avoidance, lane lines for active lane keeping, and more. It’s also available on nearly all Impreza models.
Standard FeaturesLike all Subaru models, the 2017 Impreza comes standard with all-wheel drive, which isn’t even available in most of its competitors. However, note that the base model is a price-leader because it’s pretty basic. Standard features on the base model Impreza 2.0i include a new Starlink audio system that includes a 6.5-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a rearview camera and air conditioning. Base models also get air conditioning, cruise control and incline-start assist. The standard transmission is a 5-speed manual on base models; the CVT is optional but standard on the rest of the lineup.
Factory OptionsSubaru says the 2.0i Premium will be the volume leader, and it adds a 7-speed manual shift mode for the CVT, better shocks, an updated audio system, and welcome lighting and illuminated power window switches. The Sport is a distinct model for the 2017 model year, offering more aggressive wheels, tires and suspension settings, red stitching on the dash and doors, and a better audio system with a bigger touch screen. The Limited adds more comfort features like a 6-way-power driver’s seat, an instrument cluster with a color LCD display, steering-responsive headlights and more. Stand-alone option packages include EyeSight and a moonroof.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine available for the 2017 Subaru Impreza: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder putting out 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. While similar to last year’s engine, Subaru points out that it’s 80-percent new, with the biggest improvement being a new advanced fuel-injection system. It’s connected to either a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), and being a Subaru, all-wheel drive is standard. While fuel economy is pretty good, and on paper it’s competitive with other cars in its class, the engine strains to move the 3,000-pound Impreza with authority, and the CVT’s occasionally slow reactions only exacerbate the problem. Hopefully Subaru will offer an upgrade engine; may we suggest the 175-horsepower flat-4 under the hood of the Legacy?

The 2017 Subaru Impreza is as all-new as a car can be, but it’s still all-Subaru, with standard all-wheel drive, sporty handling and a funky-sounding flat-4 engine. But everything is better. The new chassis is stiffer, the suspension more refined and the steering sharper; put it together and even mid-level models are fun to drive. It’s quieter, too, whether cruising down the highway or at full-throttle acceleration. The roomy interior offers rear seats even adults can like, the next-generation of EyeSight improves on Subaru’s camera-based driver assist and safety technology, and Subaru’s Starlink infotainment system now includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Best of all: Prices hardly budge, making the Impreza an all-wheel-drive alternative to the Mazda3, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and many others.

With a super-fuel-efficient hybrid, plus tons of cool features, it’s worth a look.","ConsWhile the Chevy Malibu is a very compelling choice, the midsize-sedan category is arguably the most competitive market segment there is. What we’re saying is that even though the Malibu is a very strong contender, personal preference and brand loyalty may sway buyers in a different direction.",22500,"Driving the Used 2017 Chevrolet MalibuWe haven’t had a chance to check out the new 9-speed automatic in the Malibu Premier, but our experiences with the Malibu have been nothing but impressive. The 2.0-liter turbocharged models pull strongly from a stoplight. The rocker switch on top of the gear selector lets you manually select gears, and although we’d prefer steering-wheel paddles, it works well enough for the few times you’re likely to use it. The nicely sorted suspension didn’t let the big 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires on our test car transmit much in the way of bumps, regardless of the surface we encountered. The payoff for the big wheels was in handling, which isn’t going to give the Mazda6 night sweats, but is certainly enough for the challenges the Malibu is likely to face.
Interior ComfortEven if you don’t use CarPlay or Android Auto, you’ll appreciate the Chevy MyLink infotainment system’s combination of big icons and physical knobs and buttons. It’s all part of an interior design that isn’t just functional, but is among the best in class from a purely esthetic point, too. The gauges are big and clear, the dash curves and swoops attractively, and it’s even easy to see out. The comfortable front seats adjust to virtually any body size, and the rear seats boast enough legroom to seat tall adults, although they might find headroom a little tight.
Exterior StylingChevrolet has managed a difficult task with its family of sedans, somehow imparting a family resemblance on the Malibu that’s immediately shared with the larger Impala and smaller Cruze, but without making small, medium and large versions of the same car. There are subtly sculpted, elegant-looking coves in the front and rear doors, and at the rear the taillights — LEDs in Premier models — tie it all together. Higher-end models also get LED daytime running lights, and super-bright HID headlights are also available. Wheel sizes range from 16 inches all the way up to the 19-inchers on our test car.
Favorite FeaturesAPPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO
While Chevrolet MyLink is one of the better touch-screen infotainment systems out there, we love the consistency using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto brings to a vehicle’s interior. Using the identical functionality of a smartphone on your infotainment system is just as desirable and useful as it sounds.
TEEN DRIVER
Nervous parents with first-time drivers can keep track of what their youngsters are up with Teen Driver’s suite, now available in LS and LT models, and all hybrids. The system lets you monitor how fast and where the car has gone, and even mutes the audio unless everyone’s strapped in.
Standard FeaturesWhile the base Malibu L model offers the basics — air conditioning, cruise control and an AM/FM radio — it’s a rental-fleet special you should skip. Instead, the 2017 Chevy Malibu lineup really starts at the LS model, which adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with USB ports and Bluetooth with its 7-inch MyLink infotainment system. There are also a standard rearview camera and a 6-way-adjustable manual driver’s seat. The very good 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder includes stop/start and hill-start assist. On the safety front, there are 10 total airbags, plus stability control and OnStar, which automatically dials for help in an accident.
Factory OptionsThere are powertrain choices in the form of the Malibu Hybrid and the 2.0-liter turbo in Premier models. Beyond that, the Malibu offers ever-increasing levels of technology, including available adaptive cruise control, blind-spot warning, forward-collision alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. There’s a 4G LTE-powered Wi-Fi hotspot to help you find your dinner spot, the available on-board navigation system can help you get there, and the Automatic Parking Assist can even help you park when you arrive. And of course there’s available leather upholstery, with Premier models offering automatic climate control.
Engine & TransmissionStandard on 2017 Malibu models from L through LT1 is the 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 6-speed automatic. This frugal drivetrain has little problem moving the Malibu, and returns up to 36 mpg on the highway. Premier models get the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which gets the new Malibu moving without hesitation. With the new 9-speed automatic transmission, it gets 33 mpg on the highway, easily competitive for the segment. The new hybrid combines two electric motors and a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder for a combined 182 horsepower and up to 49 mpg in the city. All the engines run on regular gasoline; premium is recommended for the 2.0-liter but not required. Some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel economy numbers this year, due to changes in EPA testing.

The 2017 Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan is a formidable competitor against the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Kia Optima, Hyundai Sonata, and any other car in its class you’d care to mention. The sleek design gives it, in our opinion, a best-in-class appearance, resembling the larger Chevy Impala in all the right ways. The same is true of the modern and comfortable interior as well. But it’s more than just esthetics. The 2017 Malibu’s comfortable interior boasts a big back seat, plus high-tech features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, rear cross-traffic alert and automatic-parking assist. The three engine choices include a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and a hybrid with a Volt-derived powertrain, and prices are right in line with its rivals in this highly competitive class.

A variety of models and trims — from a manual-transmission coupe or sedan to an ultra-fuel-efficient hybrid — only sweetens the 2017 Accord’s overall proposition.","ConsIf you want all-wheel drive for enhanced traction in inclement weather, check out the Subaru Impreza or Ford Fusion. A potentially fussy touch-screen system for audio and climate controls on higher trims is among the Accord’s few downsides.",23000,"Driving the Used 2017 Honda AccordAll Accord models are brisk, compliant and comfortable, with each particular model offering more or less of those traits depending on drivetrain. The bread-and-butter 4-cylinder Accord with an automatic transmission finely balances the comfort/agility equation while offering one of the best continuously variable transmissions (CVT) in the business. V6-powered sedans and coupes are surprisingly quick, and the larger engine boasts deep power reserves. The few buyers who opt for a manual transmission will be rewarded with crisp, easy shifts. The new Accord Hybrid accelerates swiftly, similar to an electric vehicle when it is being powered via electric motor. Transitions between its gasoline and electric powerplants are smooth, but the gasoline engine and electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT) drone under hard acceleration. We found the available lane-keep assist system so-so; it can nudge you back into the lane, but doesn’t work 100 percent of the time, especially on twisty 2-lane roads.
Interior ComfortAll 2017 Accord models accommodate five passengers, though the coupe has less legroom than the sedan. Rear-seat passengers in the sedan are also treated to a good view out thanks to large side windows. Up front, higher trims of the Accord have a pair of screens. The top one displays audio info and the rearview camera, while the other below shows navigation and other functions. However, the lower screen is touch-only, lacking traditional knobs for volume and tuning. Lower-trim models don’t have the secondary screen, and instead offer easy-to-use controls. In hybrid Accords the rear seat doesn’t fold due to the battery pack.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Honda Accord pulls off quite a feat when it comes to style: It looks handsome, contemporary, yet timeless. This is a well-proportioned vehicle whose design will likely hold up well as the years pass. The Accord coupe, too, looks elegant, sporty and more expensive than it is. Among the few traits of which we’re on the fence is the way the grille wraps into the elongated headlights; it can be a little too sweeping. Hybrid Accord models look similar to their gasoline-only counterparts, except for their small hybrid badges and blue accents on the grille, headlights and taillights.
Favorite FeaturesHONDA LANEWATCH
This safety system has been around a few years and still impresses. Via a camera mounted under the right-side mirror, it displays a real-time view of what’s happening in the next lane when you activate the turn signal, showing whatever may be in your blind spot so you don’t collide.
ACCORD HYBRID
One of the best things about the reintroduced Accord Hybrid — aside from its nearly 50-mpg rating — is that it looks just like a regular Accord. For buyers who want great fuel economy but don’t want way-out-there looks, the hybrid Accord is an excellent choice.
Standard FeaturesIncluding the new Sport Special Edition, the 2017 Accord sedan is available in seven trims. At the lowest end, a base LX includes rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with Bluetooth connectivity and USB and auxiliary inputs, and an 8-inch color display. We recommend stepping up to at least the Sport or Sport Special Edition, which include 10-way-power-adjustable driver’s seat, LED fog lights and daytime running lights, split-folding rear seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and in the Special Edition, leather interior with heated front seats. The Accord’s standard safety features include antilock brakes and stability- and traction-control systems.
Factory OptionsMost extras come by climbing trims, with a notable exception being the HondaSensing suite of features that we heartily recommend. For $1,000, it includes lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation braking, and road-departure mitigation system. HondaSensing is standard on top-line Touring and all hybrid models of the 2017 Accord. Other extras available depending on trim include the LaneWatch blind-spot monitoring system, navigation, upgraded audio, HomeLink integrated garage opener, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and the HondaLink smartphone connectivity system.
Engine & TransmissionThe Honda Accord sedan and coupe are available with 4- or 6-cylinder engines tied to both manual and automatic transmissions, while the gasoline-electric Accord Hybrid is offered as a sedan only. Gasoline models with the 4-cylinder with an automatic transmission use a CVT that feels natural, while V6 models have a traditional 6-speed automatic. If you want a V6 Accord with a manual transmission, that combination is available in coupe form only. At up to 36 mpg, even a standard Accord is highly efficient. For those seeking the most efficient Honda Accord, the hybrid model earns a 49-mpg EPA rating. The hybrid uses both a 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a pair of electric motors. A lithium-ion battery pack sits in the rear of the car.

Long loved for its faithful reliability, great resale value and inherent ability to please a wide palette of buyers, the 2017 Accord remains a highly recommendable car even as rivals clamor for its benchmark status. The Accord just marked its 40th anniversary, and it shows no sign of resting on its laurels. The standard model was upgraded last year with features like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and automatic emergency braking, and this year marks the reintroduction of a hybrid model.

Even the standard 3.7-liter V6 is quite good, offering immediate power for passing and merging. Those looking for diesel-like fuel economy might enjoy the hybrid, which offers better performance than the base V6 and impressive fuel-economy figures. The Q70’s available magnesium paddle shifters allow manual gear change via the 7-speed automatic transmission, and the steering, springs and shocks are all tuned for aggressive driving without returning an overly harsh ride. Four driver-selectable modes — Standard, Eco, Sport and Snow — optimize the Infiniti’s throttle sensitivity and transmission for the task at hand. However, the Eco Pedal system, which makes it harder to push down the accelerator in an attempt to encourage more efficient driving habits, is a bit odd.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Q70’s interior is open and inviting, and passengers won’t have any issues getting comfortable. We particularly like the Q70’s driver’s seat and positioning. We’re not as hot on the dash design. It has a nice vertical flow but too many buttons and dials, which create a busy and potentially confusing layout. Opting for the extra rear-seat legroom in the Q70L gives way to an additional 5.6 inches of stretch-out room. That extra room is about all you get — you won’t find the kind of auxiliary audio and climate controls that rear-seat passengers of a Lexus GS can enjoy.
Exterior StylingThe Q70 is at once elegant, muscular, yet understated. We’re thankful that Infiniti has resisted the temptation to add a gaping grille to the Q70, a design that some rivals are attaching to every car they can produce. The Premium Select Edition aims to add a more menacing guise with dark chrome trim, darkened lower rear-bumper finisher, rear spoiler and 20-inch wheels that are also darkened. Long-wheelbase Q70 models are 202 inches in total length, compared to the standard 196.1.

Standard FeaturesThanks to the complimentary inclusion of the Premium Package — which Infiniti says is a $4,200 value — even a base, 2017 Infiniti Q70 3.7 is a well-equipped sedan that packs quite a value.

In addition to their extra room, Q70L models have heated rear seats.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive is optional on all models except the Q70 Hybrid, which is rear-drive only. And extra rear-seat room can be bought via the long-wheelbase Q70L, also available in all forms except the hybrid. Other major options are bundled into packages and include higher-grade semi-aniline leather seating, power rear sunshade, heated rear seats, sport-tuned suspension and Bose surround-sound system. Tech and safety options include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure/prevention system, forward and reverse emergency braking, and Infiniti’s innovative Predictive Forward Collision Warning, which warns the driver if a vehicle two cars ahead brakes suddenly.

The standard engine is a V6 in the Q70 3.7, while a big, 5.6-liter V8 does duty in the Q70 5.6. The Q70 Hybrid employs a 3.5-liter V6 paired with an electric motor that’s good for a combined output of 360 horsepower and up to 33 mpg. All three engines work with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and gearshifts can be made manually through steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. All models come standard with rear-wheel drive (RWD), and the Q70 3.7 and Q70 5.6 can be had with all-wheel drive (AWD).

Commercial users, meanwhile, may find the Transit Connect’s size too small and its power output too modest. The Mercedes-Benz Metris offers more power and higher towing and payload capacity.
What's New?The formerly optional 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is no longer available, leaving the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder as the sole powerplant. The new Sync 3 telematics system is offered in higher trims, and the top-line Titanium passenger model can now be had in short-wheelbase form.
Available in passenger or cargo form, the 2017 Ford Transit Connect is smaller than traditional minivans like the Honda Odyssey and full-size commercial vans like its own big brother the Ford Transit, yet big enough to carry up to seven people or accommodate over 128 cubic feet of cargo. Unlike rivals such as the Ram ProMaster City and Nissan NV200, the 2017 Transit Connect is offered in two sizes: short or long wheelbase. At about the same length as a midsize sedan, even an extended-length Transit Connect is a snap to maneuver and can be parked in a residential garage. In addition to its easy driving manners, the standard 4-cylinder is efficient, good for the bottom line of families and businesses.
Used 2017 Ford Transit Connect Cargo PricingThe 2017 Ford Transit Connect has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $24,000 for a cargo van. Wagon models begin just under $26,700 for both 5- or 7-passenger models. A loaded, 7-passenger Ford Transit Connect Titanium wagon can reach the low-$30,000 range. At its starting price, the Transit Connect begins above the Nissan NV200 cargo van and is in line with the Ram ProMaster City. Where the fresher Mercedes-Benz Metris was several thousand more upon debut, the new Worker base model is more tempting at just under $27,000. Passenger versions start several thousand below larger minivan rivals like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Transit Connect. In the years ahead, the Transit Connect’s resale value is expected to hold up fairly well.
Driving the Used 2017 Ford Transit Connect CargoTwo of the most compelling reasons to buy a small van are for easier maneuverability and higher fuel economy, and the 2017 Ford Transit Connect delivers both. If your commercial fleet is transitioning out of or complementing its older, full-size cargo vans with the Transit Connect, this compact Ford will feel far easier to drive. With its unibody chassis and front-wheel-drive configuration, the Transit Connect is more akin to a higher-riding sedan than a traditional body-on-frame cargo van. We also like this Ford’s tight turning radius — especially helpful in city settings. The naturally aspirated 2.5-liter engine doesn’t propel Ford’s compact van with as much gusto as the formerly available turbocharged 1.6-liter, but the engine is adequate for its duties and pairs well with the 6-speed automatic transmission. As a family vehicle, it brings similar nimble traits but doesn’t feel as substantial as larger passenger vans like the Honda Odyssey.
Interior ComfortShort-wheelbase (SWB) wagon versions of the 2017 Transit Connect seat five passengers across two rows, while long-wheelbase (LWB) models hold seven across three rows. Second-row captain’s chairs are standard in the top-line Titanium Wagon and optional on the XLT but reduce passenger count to six. Cargo vans have two seats up front, with 128.6 cubic feet of rear storage for LWB models and 103.9 for SWB versions. With rear seats that can fold, flip or be removed, even a passenger version can swallow a lot of gear. Up front, the Transit Connect looks familiar to the Ford family’s stylish Focus and Escape.
Exterior StylingWhen it entered its second generation four years ago, the Ford Transit Connect said goodbye to the high-top sneaker shape of its predecessor and hello to a far more stylish aesthetic. Thankfully its larger shape still works in its favor where practicality is concerned. This is one of the few small vans offering the choice of a traditional liftgate or split cargo doors that open up to 180 degrees. A short-wheelbase Transit Connect is 173.9 inches in length, while a long-wheelbase model is over a foot longer at 189.7 inches.
Favorite FeaturesFORD TELEMATICS A potential asset for fleet owners, this system tracks a vehicle’s location and also monitors its speed and how long it sits idle. It would also come in handy for parents of teenage drivers — theoretically speaking, of course.
 SMALL FOOTPRINT, BIG POTENTIAL While originally intended for commercial fleets in van form, the Transit Connect passenger wagon makes an excellent alternative to minivans, which are anything but mini these days. It can carry a family of seven or bikes, surfboards or other gear, all while being easier than an SUV to load and unload. 
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Ford Transit Connect is available in XL, XLT and — in passenger form — Titanium trims. The least expensive Transit Connect, an XL cargo model, has just the basics like vinyl seats, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with audio input jack, 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, tilt/telescoping steering wheel and rear cargo lights. Base XL passenger versions also come with cruise control and rear-window defroster. You’ll have to pay extra or step up to the more recommendable XLT version to get better amenities like cloth seats and a rearview camera.
Factory OptionsHelpful features include front and rear parking sensors, rearview camera and choice of swing-out rear doors. Ford’s Sync infotainment systems with Bluetooth wireless connectivity are now easier to recommend, especially the new Sync 3 system that offers navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. A top-line Titanium Transit Connect passenger wagon includes leather seating (heated up front), dual-zone climate control and auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Titanium model can also be had with blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and panoramic glass roof. Cargo models can be configured to accommodate a variety of commercial and delivery needs.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2017, Ford is streamlining the Transit Connect powertrain offerings. With the formerly optional 1.6-liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder no longer available, all Transit Connects will use the standard 2.5-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder. The engine is connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all Transit Connects are front-wheel drive. The 2.5-liter can be specified for compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, aka propane). The Transit Connect is rated to tow up to 2,000 pounds, but that figure can’t match the 5,000-pound tow rating of Mercedes-Benz’s Metris van. Nor can the Ford’s commercial payload capacity of 1,620 pounds match the Metris figures of 2,502 pounds (cargo) or 1,874 pounds (passenger model).
2.5-liter inline-4169 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm171 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (cargo van), 19/27 mpg (passenger wagon)
 Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions.

Yet it’s also a solid choice for those looking to take their families into deep snow, backwoods off-road trails or other out-of-the way places.","ConsWhile the Subaru Outback is surprisingly capable for a crossover SUV, it’s no match for dedicated off-roaders like a Jeep Wrangler. Additionally, there’s no 3rd-row seat option, and 6-cylinder models especially aren’t cheap.",26500,"Driving the Used 2017 Subaru OutbackWhile the 2017 Subaru Outback Touring is loaded with every option, adding special leather and model-specific exterior trim to appeal to luxury buyers, one thing remains true: Regardless of model, the Subaru Outback can handle just about anything. Sure, there’s the quiet cabin, car-like driving characteristics thanks to sharing its underpinnings with the Legacy sedan, and a comfortable around-town and highway ride. But when the roads turn nasty, the Outback keeps going. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is no powerhouse, but it’s plenty adequate for the task, and it offers very good fuel economy. The 6-cylinder has more power, but not quite as much as you might think, and it’s only available on more expensive models. The real hero is the standard all-wheel-drive system, which uses Active Torque Vectoring to enhance traction at higher speeds by automatically routing power for better stability, and X-Mode and Hill Descent Control to bolster off-road ability.
Interior ComfortPart of the new 2017 Outback Touring’s upgrades is new Java Brown perforated leather upholstery, with contrasting ivory stitching. It also includes a unique woodgrain and piano-black interior trim. Otherwise, the interior is very similar to the Legacy sedan’s, no bad thing, as the clean and functional layout benefits from good ergonomics and the latest touch-screen infotainment system’s design. All seating positions are comfortable, but we especially like the roomy, reclining rear seat. There’s plenty of cargo space in this crossover SUV, of course, and that goes double with the seats folded. It’s also notably quiet inside, whether accelerating or cruising.
Exterior StylingThe Outback Touring for 2017 adds some visual flair to what is already a solidly handsome crossover SUV. There’s a unique-to-the-model Brilliant Brown color that looks good, even though ""brilliant"" is an odd adjective for brown. We also like the silver finish on the roof rails. But it’s all frosting on an already tasty cake. We like the shape of the Outback, which looks purposeful and stylish, one of those cars that still looks classy when it’s caked in mud. The rugged lower body cladding and round fog lights would be passé on another car, but here they’re signature styling elements.
Favorite FeaturesX-MODEX-Mode is a standard feature of all Outback models. It’s designed to help this crossover SUV maintain its composure even under difficult off-road circumstances. On top of that, it includes Hill Descent Control, which takes over braking duties during steep descents.
PIVOTING ROOF CROSSBARThe Subaru Outback makes exceptionally clever use of its roof rails. Normally, they’re lengthwise with the car, but when you need crossbars to actually carry something on the roof, the rails pivot outward, snapping into place on the other side. They even adjust fore and aft.
Standard FeaturesAll 2017 Outback models come with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and all-wheel drive with X-Mode and hill-descent control. Other features include standard grille shutters, which close at highway speeds to improve fuel economy. Inside, you’ll find the usual things like power windows, door locks and mirrors, cruise control and air conditioning. The standard infotainment system uses a 6.2-inch touch screen, and includes compatibility with iHeart Radio, Aha and Pandora, and of course also comes with USB and Bluetooth inputs. Safety features include a standard rearview camera, and airbags under the seat cushions to prevent submarining in a crash.
Factory OptionsChief among options for the Subaru Outback are the company’s EyeSight system, which uses cameras to add adaptive cruise control; lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, pre-collision braking and even steering-responsive fog lights on some models. Available for the first time are Reverse Automatic Braking and automatic high beams, available on Sport models as part of the EyeSight system. The available power liftgate has a programmable maximum height, and there’s a voice-activated navigation system with a larger and sharp 7-inch screen. Also available is a leather interior trimmed with classy-looking faux wood on Limited models, along with an upgraded harman/kardon audio system.
Engine & TransmissionSubarus use an engine configuration known as a ""boxer,"" where the pistons are parallel to the ground; imagine a ""V-type” engine, then widen the V until you’ve made it into a flat line, and you have the layout of the Subaru engines. This layout lowers the center of gravity, which aids handling. There are two engines available. The 2.5-liter standard 4-cylinder offers up 175 horsepower, while the 6-cylinder version has a much more robust 256 horsepower. However, while the 6-cylinder is definitely quicker than the 4-cylinder version, neither is what we’d call quick. Both send power through a continuously variable automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. The all-wheel drive system includes X-Mode for low-speed traction, and Active Torque Vectoring for high-speed stability in corners.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2017 Subaru Outback sees the addition of a whole new model, the Outback Touring, which includes every single option and adds unique leather and exterior trim. Other improvements include Reverse Auto Braking and high-beam assist.
Despite outward appearances, the 2017 Subaru Outback is much more than a high-riding wagon version of the Subaru Legacy sedan. Chief among the differences are the Subaru Outback’s X-Mode off-road-assist system and 8.7 inches of ground clearance, which help back up the Outback’s visual suggestion that it really can tackle tough off-road situations. And it can; unlike competitors like the Chevrolet Equinox or Nissan Murano, the Outback’s all-wheel-drive system is designed to tackle more than just snowy roads and dusty trails. Yet inside, the Outback is downright luxurious, especially in the new Outback Touring model, which adds unique leather and exterior trim. Technologies, like the EyeSight collision-mitigation and active cruise control, elevate the Outback to the realm of many premium-luxury SUVs.

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. The starter and alternator functions are combined into one unit, and the engine is equipped with an Auto Stop/Start feature. The hybrid can travel on pure electric power for short distances at speeds below 25 mph.

Using the same 2.0-liter engine only with slightly higher compression and an electric motor assist, the XV Crosstrek Hybrid delivers 12 additional horsepower and 18 more lb-ft of torque, plus an additional 4 mpg in city driving. Models equipped with navigation now feature the Aha infotainment app.
If there is one thing Subaru owners love about their vehicles it is ground clearance. So, when Subaru decided to make a new SUV from its popular Impreza hatchback, they started by raising it to a whopping 8.7 inches. Toss in a little cladding, some cool colors and snappy rims, and you’ve got the 2014 XV Crosstrek. Although not terribly powerful, the XV Crosstrek is easy on your fuel budget, and it can go places most of its rivals can’t. Priced around"

Those who are above average in height or weight might find the 500’s interior a cramped proposition.",17000,"Driving the Used 2017 FIAT 500The subcompact 2017 Fiat 500 is a pretty lightweight affair, which explains why its 101- horsepower engine actually does a pretty good job of moving this little Italian tomato on wheels. Acceleration and passing power are not going to win over many enthusiasts, but in city driving, the 500 coupe and cabrio zip about quite nicely. Because it measures a mere 140 inches, the 500 has no problem finding parking. While we will always love a good 5-speed manual, we know most of the 500s out there will go into the world with Fiat’s 6-speed automatic. However, if you need more than just “okay” acceleration, the 160-horsepower turbocharged Abarth is the 500 for you. From handling to acceleration to braking, the Abarth is superior to the base 500. For those looking for a greener shade of 500, the electric 500e can travel up to 87 miles before needing to recharge.
Interior ComfortFiat’s subcompact 500 for 2017 is roomier up front than you might expect, and just as tight in back as it looks. The interior style lives up to the promise of the quirky but fashionable exterior, and we found the materials, build quality and seat comfort impressive for a car with a starting price around $17,000. As the athlete of the group, the Fiat 500 Abarth offers aggressively bolstered front seats, exclusive red stitching and a thick-rimmed, flat-bottom steering wheel.
Exterior StylingThe subcompact 2017 Fiat 500 is a modern interpretation of 1957’s tiny, rear-engined original. Although larger than the original, it’s still seven inches shorter than today’s Mini Cooper. The iconic sloping rear end embodies the 500’s personality, though it limits rear headroom. The Fiat 500 is available in a stretched 4-door model that alleviates many of the coupe’s shortcomings. The 500 is offered in Pop, Lounge and Abarth, all available in coupe or convertible form. The 500e electric is offered in coupe form only. Wheels, fascias and body trim differentiate the models.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT POWER CONVERTIBLE TOPThe 2017 Fiat 500 cabrio employs a rather unconventional power top. The canvas roll-top design opens the cabin to the elements while leaving a protective metal frame in place. Because it’s a roll top, the power top can be opened at speeds as high as 60 mph.
ABARTHIt may not roll off the tongue as easily as “Cooper S” or “GTI,” but the lightweight 500 Abarth will put a smile on your face every time you put foot to accelerator. Nicely equipped for around $20,000, the Abarth offers a lot of performance for the money.
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Fiat 500 Pop includes a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15-inch aluminum wheels, a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, cruise control, power window/locks/mirrors, Bluetooth, and a 6-speaker 5-inch touch-screen audio system with a USB port for portable music players. The range-topping Abarth variant includes a 276-watt Alpine audio system, 16-inch hyper-black wheels, sport-tuned suspension and a leather-wrapped dashboard. Standard safety features include seven airbags, hill-start assist to help prevent vehicle rollback on steep inclines and seemingly all the other advancements we’re seeing on new cars in this price range and beyond.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded 2017 Fiat 500 Lounge includes a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather seats, heated front seats, rear parking sensors, navigation, Beats by Dr. Dre audio system and automatic climate control. The 500 Pop Sport Appearance package adds sport fascia, 16-inch alloy wheels, rear spoiler, side ground effects and black-trimmed lights. The mighty Abarth offers larger 17-inch wheels, 2-tone leather-trimmed seats and your choice of either white or red body-side stripes.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive 2017 Fiat 500 subcompact is motivated by a small but sophisticated 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine using Fiat’s patented MultiAir technology, which varies intake-valve timing and lift. Fiat tunes this engine to two power levels: The 500 Pop and Lounge get a 101-horsepower (naturally aspirated) version, while the turbocharged Abarth cranks out 160 horsepower. The 500e electric is rated for 111 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. With the exception of the 500e, all of the 500s offer the choice of a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. We like the automatic for its extra ratio and responsive shifting though it does cut fuel efficiency by more than 10 percent. The 500e uses a single-speed automatic.

Despite getting off to a rocky start, the 2017 Fiat 500 coupe and 500c cabrio have begun to worm their way into our automotive heart. The pair not only prove that Americans will buy small cars even when gas is cheap, but that an inexpensive small car doesn’t have to be boring, slow or poorly equipped. Smaller than both the Ford Fiesta and Mini Cooper Hardtop, what the 2017 Fiat 500 lacks in passenger space it makes up for with its playful attitude, long list of stand-alone options and varied lineup, including the all-electric 500e and sporty turbocharged Abarth.

It also has less interior room than a Hyundai Santa Fe Sport or Honda CR-V. Power from the 4-cylinder engine is a bit underwhelming, and Jeep’s long-term reliability and resale figures, while improving, still lag behind most Japanese competitors.",24500,"Driving the Used 2017 Jeep CherokeeJeep’s Cherokee compact SUV for 2017 comes in numerous flavors, including Sport, Latitude, Limited, Overland and Trailhawk. There are also several specialty trims. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard on all but the Trailhawk; however, Jeep offers three 4-wheel drive (4WD) options, all of which feature the Selec-Terrain system. Selec-Terrain allows for optimal traction with driver-selectable settings for Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and, on the Trailhawk, Rock. The system can also be set to Auto, which allows the Cherokee to decide for you. More luxurious and certainly more off-road capable than the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 or Ford Escape, the Cherokee’s additional weight makes its 4-cylinder engine feel less peppy and spry than these competitors, and its real-world fuel economy is not all that great, either. For those needing power to pass or pull, the 2017 Jeep Cherokee’s V6 option is the way to go.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV interior blends traditional Jeep cues — such as the trapezoidal ""center stack"" — with modern touches to create an attractive and upscale layout. The seats offer good support and come trimmed in either attractive cloth or soft Nappa leather. The heated and ventilated top-of-the-line seats also come with power adjustments and memory. The 2nd-row seats adjust forward and backward for better legroom, and split 60/40 for maximum cargo flexibility. We were particularly fond of the available wireless-device charging pad, plus the enormous glove box. However, we do wish the Cherokee offered more room overall.
Exterior Styling""Polarizing"" is the best way to sum up the Jeep Cherokee for 2017. It’s one thing to stray from the traditional Jeep design aesthetic of round headlights flanking a 7-slot grille, but quite another to ditch the appearance of headlights entirely. However, we’ve warmed up to the newest Jeep Cherokee, and there’s a lot here that says “Jeep.” The 7-slot grille has a ""kink"" folding it into the hood, and the less controversial rear resembles the Grand Cherokee SUV. Trailhawk versions kick up the macho with a higher ride, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear treatments.
Favorite Features9-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION Designed by ZF, the 2017 Jeep Cherokee’s 9-speed automatic maximizes fuel economy while delivering good performance. Although earlier versions suffered from some lag issues, our version worked flawlessly and helped the Cherokee’s V6 deliver highway fuel economy worthy of a 4-cylinder.
 SELEC-TERRAIN You won’t find anything like this on a Honda CR-V or Subaru Forester. The Selec-Terrain system on the 2017 Cherokee uses the vehicle’s brakes, traction and stability control and engine-management system to deliver optimal grip on varying road conditions. 
Standard FeaturesAll Jeep Cherokee SUVs come standard with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, offering very good fuel economy and a range of about 500 miles on a tank of gasoline. Other standard equipment includes a Uconnect 5-inch touch-screen media center that includes Bluetooth, USB, SD and auxiliary ports. Also standard are a 3.5-inch full-color center display, 10 airbags, electronic stability control, traction control, Hill-start Assist, electric power steering, and an electric parking brake, plus cruise control, air conditioning with rear outlets, and remote keyless entry. The Jeep Cargo Management system includes standard hooks and a storage tote.
Factory OptionsJeep Cherokee Sport, Latitude, Altitude, Limited and Trailhawk models can get the 3.2-liter Pentastar V6 engine, which is standard on the Overland. There are three 4WD systems available as well: Active Drive I, Active Drive II and, on Trailhawk models, Active Drive Lock. Other upgrades include an 8.4-inch touch screen for Uconnect, a 9-speaker Alpine audio system and a CommandView dual-pane panoramic sunroof with power sunshade. Limited models offer leather, heated and ventilated power seats, a heated steering wheel, Keyless Enter-N-Go, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Trailhawk models emphasize off-road capabilities with skidplates, an increased ride height and a more rugged look.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine for the 2017 Jeep Cherokee is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine offering 184 horsepower. However, unlike many of its competitors, Jeep offers a V6 engine in its small SUV as well: a 3.2-liter V6 with 271 horsepower, and the added ability to tow up to 4,500 pounds. Both engines offer good fuel economy. Both engines come with a 9-speed automatic transmission, whether equipped with front-drive or 4WD. Three different 4WD systems are available, ranging from the Jeep Active Drive I and Jeep Active Drive II, to the aggressive Jeep Active Drive Lock reserved for the off-road-ready Trailhawk. V6 models get a modest fuel-economy bump thanks to the standard start/stop mechanism.

The Trailhawk gains a number of new standard features including ventilated Nappa leather seats and a heated steering wheel. Protective skidplates and a tow-prep package can now be ordered on the Overland trim.
Although the 2017 Jeep Cherokee is sized and priced like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Nissan Rogue, it is so much more than just a compact SUV with all-wheel-drive abilities. In fact, the Cherokee line is all-inclusive, running the gamut from basic transportation to rugged off-road-ready SUV. In between are a number of models, some showing a more sporting side to compete with the SUVs like the Mazda CX-5, while others offer luxury on par with the Lexus RX, Land Rover Evoque and BMW X3. Jeep’s Cherokee compact SUV suffers from some shortcomings, however, like its underpowered 4-cylinder engine and, on upper trims, a rather exorbitant price tag. An available V6 solves the power problem, plus provides an impressive 4,500-pound tow rating.

But if you’re looking for a luxury sedan that’s great to drive, offers class-leading technology, looks great and is even a bargain in its market segment, you’ll be hard-pressed to do better than the 2017 Audi A4.","ConsThe high-tech gauges may not be for everyone, and they’re standard on top-line Prestige models. Additionally, while bigger than the Cadillac ATS, the Audi A4’s rear seat is on the small side compared to the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.",35850,"Driving the Used 2017 Audi A4Even if you strip away all the high-tech digital gauges, amazing adaptive cruise control and adjustable shocks that you get on top-end 2017 A4 models, the new A4 is still outstanding to drive. The steering feels sharp and precise, and the suspension strikes an excellent compromise between a comfortable on-road ride and good handling. The newly revised 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder puts out 252 horsepower, enough to scoot the A4 to 60 mph in about 5.7 seconds, easily clicking off shifts from the dual-clutch 7-speed automatic transmission. Prestige models up the ante with several new technologies, such as adjustable dampers that stiffen when the Drive Mode Select is in Dynamic mode. The adaptive cruise control is a wonder, integrating the GPS and mapping to anticipate and slow down for turns. Around town it’s comfortable and quiet, with Comfort mode returning a smooth ride, relaxed throttle response and lighter steering.
Interior ComfortWhile the big news is the virtual cockpit, there’s more to the 2017 A4 interior than the tech. MMI gets a big improvement, using a touch pad to make entering addresses a breeze. The dash is simpler as well, with the new MMI screen moved to the top as we’ve seen in other recent Audi models. The basics are spot-on, too, with comfortable seats, easy-to-use main controls and first-rate materials. The smallish rear seat, lack of a soft spot for the driver’s right knee to rest, and a sometimes busy virtual cockpit display are the only real downsides.
Exterior StylingAt first glance there’s not much new, but upon closer inspection, nothing was left unchanged. The car is a little wider and longer, but with more angular lines around the grille, headlights, and details. Take the character line that runs along the side of the car, for example. On the old one it petered out weakly as it approached the taillight. Now it boldly cuts through to the trunk on one end, while in front, the hood itself makes up the upper portion of the line. The proportions are spot-on, and the car just looks right from any angle.
Favorite FeaturesVIRTUAL COCKPIT
Nobody has taken LCD gauges as far as Audi. The Google maps — complete with satellite view — take over the entire display once you minimize the gauges. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg; suffice it to say it makes the A4 feel like a spaceship.
ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
The 2017 Audi A4’s adaptive cruise control is terrific. Yes, it slows itself in traffic to a complete stop, but it goes even further. Using GPS and navigation, it knows when a turn is coming up, and automatically slows to a safe speed. It also slows for off-ramps when using route guidance.
Standard FeaturesOf course the 2017 Audi A4 comes nicely equipped. Standard issue on even the base A4 Ultra includes 3-zone automatic climate control, leather seating and a power sunroof. The MMI infotainment display is mounted high on the dash, with the rotary controller in front of the shifter. All Audi A4 models also come with keyless ignition, HID headlights with cool LED accents, a rearview camera, and LED taillights above dual exhausts. Other standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, paddle shifters for the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, automatic start/stop to help conserve fuel at stoplights, and Audi’s Drive Select adjustable drive modes.
Factory OptionsWe’ve talked the virtual cockpit to death, but it’s standard on the Prestige and available on the Premium Plus models. Also available is a 7-inch infotainment screen, or an 8.2-inch version with navigation and the whole enchilada. A sport suspension option lowers ride height about an inch and gives the A4 more bite in corners, and an available adaptive-damping suspension lowers the car about half an inch and adds different shock-absorber stiffness for Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. On Premium Plus and Prestige models you get 18-inch wheels and available summer tires.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine size available for the 2017 Audi A4, but it comes in two flavors. With 2.0 liters of displacement, it puts out 190 horsepower on the front-drive Ultra trims and is connected to a 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission that can be operated in normal “D,” in sportier “S,” or manually through the standard steering-wheel-mounted paddles. All other models have a more powerful 252 horsepower version of the 2.0-liter with either front-wheel or quattro all-wheel drive. Quattro not only provides superior handling and wet-weather grip, but also accelerates the A4 from a standstill to 60 mph in about 5.7 seconds. The more powerful A4 Quattro models also offer the option of a 6-speed manual, the only car in this class to offer a manual with all-wheel drive.

As the newest version of its most popular sedan, there’s a lot riding on the new 2017 Audi A4. Good thing Audi nailed it. The new Audi A4 is packed full of cutting-edge and class-exclusive technology, like a customizable instrument display that shows not just gauges, but Google maps and directions. The new adaptive cruise control is integrated with GPS so it automatically slows the car as you approach a turn. But even without the electronic wizardry, the new Audi A4 would be a worthy competitor against the likes of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and other competitors. The powerful engine, available all-wheel drive and sharp driving dynamics make this car fun no matter what.

Toyota’s midsize sedan isn’t as fun to drive as a Mazda Mazda6 or even an Accord, nor is it as fuel-efficient as either. If you want all-wheel drive for improved traction, look to the Subaru Legacy or Ford Fusion.",23905,"Driving the Used 2017 Toyota Camry HybridThanks to revised suspension tuning that came with the 2015 revamp, the latest Camry sedan delivers a slightly livelier driving experience. But don’t confuse the Camry for a corner-carver: Its emphasis remains quiet and comfortable road manners. The standard 178-horsepower 4-cylinder engine that most Camry buyers will choose is more than adequate for everyday acceleration and passing power. Linked exclusively to a 6-speed automatic transmission, it is a willing and faithful partner in the city, on country roads, or on interstate highways. Those who opt for the 268-horsepower V6 will be rewarded with surprisingly strong acceleration, a well of power reserves and only a slight reduction in fuel economy. The Camry XSE trim has a sportier flair, but its larger 18-inch wheels and stiffer shocks somewhat diminish ride quality. On the other end of the spectrum, the Camry Hybrid makes 40 mpg a reality with minimal loss of refinement.
Interior ComfortThe 5-passenger interior of the 2017 Camry isn’t as stylistically forward as its exterior might suggest, but it’s hardly bland. Moreover, it’s supremely functional. Big cup holders and multiple storage nooks surround the sporty gear selector, and even the steering wheel has a familiar feel and looks more sophisticated now with its bevy of integrated controls. In the sportier SE and XSE models, paddle shifters bloom from the steering column for manually selecting gears. The Camry has good room for passengers up front and in back, and the trunk has a sizable 15.4 cubic feet of space. The trunk of Camry Hybrid models is a couple cubic feet smaller, but unlike the Honda Accord Hybrid, its rear seat folds. As mentioned above, the Camry uses traditional knobs and dials around its standard 6.1-inch or optional 7-inch display screen. The controls are big, easy to read and simple to use.
Exterior StylingHave you ever seen a more stylish Camry? We haven’t. The significant revisions to the sheet metal that arrived a couple of years ago still look fresh for 2017. Bookended by an eye-catching front end and a nicely detailed rear, the stylish — but not outlandish — Camry is sure to attract new buyers without scaring away longtime devotees. For buyers who want extra edge, the Camry SE and XSE trims offer slightly more aggressive notes with piano-black lower front grille. Part of the beauty of the Camry Hybrid is that it looks similar to a standard model. You’ll have to look pretty closely for that most fuel-efficient of Camrys, distinguished with subtle hybrid badges.
Favorite FeaturesWIRELESS PHONE CHARGING
Tired of stringing wires across your console to charge your mobile devices? The 2017 Camry sedan eliminates this problem with the Qi-compatible wireless charging pad, now standard in XLE and XSE trims. Although most phones require a special case to take advantage of the pad, some newer phones already incorporate the technology.
SIMPLE CONTROLS
While other cars like the Honda Accord put an emphasis on touch-screen controls for audio and climate functions, the Camry sticks with knobs and buttons. They may look less digital, but in reality they are far easier to use, which we’ll take any day.
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Camry sedan is available in four main versions: LE, SE, and two top trims, the XLE and XSE. The least-expensive Camry, the LE, includes an automatic transmission, backup camera, and 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. Standard audio/infotainment includes a 6.1-inch touch screen and AM/FM/CD player with USB and auxiliary inputs, and Bluetooth phone connectivity with Siri Eyes Free compatibility for Apple products. The Camry’s safety features include traction and stability controls, 10 airbags, and a battery-saver function that automatically shuts off interior lights if left on. The 2017 Camry also includes Toyota Care — two years or 25,000 miles of scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsMoving up to the SE model nets upgraded cloth seats, a leather-trimmed steering wheel, a sport-tuned suspension and 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, which we think is well worth the $770 bump over the base model. The Camry XLE and XSE include a leather interior with heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, a larger display screen with navigation and JBL audio, and the option of a V6. The XSE is the sportier of the pair with an Ultrasuede leather interior, shift paddles, a sport suspension, and 18-inch wheels. All models can be had with a moonroof. The XLE and XSE trims can be equipped with blind-spot monitoring, radar-based cruise control, lane-departure warning, and pre-collision braking. Unlike the Honda Accord, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility are not available on the 2017 Camry.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 Camry has a choice of three powertrains. Most buyers will be more than satisfied with the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that offers a good blend of performance and fuel economy. Those seeking oodles of smooth power can opt for Toyota’s 3.5-liter V6 engine, but you’ll have to step up to an XLE or XSE trim. The 2017 Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with an electric motor. That model earns up to 40 mpg combined — a high number, but still several below that of the latest Accord Hybrid. All Camry models are front-wheel drive. Gasoline models are linked to a refined 6-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid Camry uses an electronically controlled continuously variable automatic transmission, which has the tendency to drone under acceleration.

The 2017 Toyota Camry remains among the most recommendable sedans for a wide range of buyers. Now celebrating its 35th year, there’s no one single reason why the Camry midsize sedan is among the best-selling vehicles in the nation, but rather a combination of winning factors. Whether you desire reliability, efficiency, easy driving manners, great resale value, or some of the latest safety features like automatic emergency braking, the Camry checks all the boxes. Like the Honda Accord, the Camry is available with 4- and 6-cylinder engines, and as a hybrid. It’s not quite the mpg champion, nor is this Toyota known for its grin-inducing driving dynamics. Rather, the Camry excels as a no-fuss commuting companion and comfortable conveyor of family and friends.

This year, it’s even a little bit of a looker.","ConsDespite the visual upgrades, the Forester still offers more practicality than pulchritude. And despite a turbo engine that makes the Forester genuinely quick, those looking for more zip should maybe check out options like the Ford Escape, which trades some practicality for pizazz.",23500,"Driving the Used 2017 Subaru ForesterThe 2017 Subaru Forester is one of an increasingly rare breed that is equally adept on-road and off-road. The all-wheel-drive system, which now includes torque vectoring on turbo models, makes the most of the engine’s torque to help deliver smooth and even power delivery regardless of conditions. Regardless of model, that power is delivered through a continuously variable automatic transmission that helps keep fuel economy near the top of the class, but is unfortunately a little sloppy-feeling from a dead stop. But it’s a minor hiccup in an otherwise solid drivetrain. The suspension blends comfort and control without sacrificing either, with minimal body roll in corners, but with enough suspension travel to absorb big bumps when taking that less beaten path. The electrically assisted power steering feels precise, and if you want extra power, the XT turbo models are downright quick, getting to 60 mph in about six seconds.
Interior ComfortWith thicker glass, an acoustic windshield, new door seals and additional sound deadening under the floor, the 2017 Subaru Forester promises to be notably quieter than its predecessor. Soft-touch surfaces already helped make the Forester feel upscale, and the newly upgraded interior on the Forester Touring models ups that ante considerably. They add some refinement to an interior design that was already excellent thanks to its generous visibility and sensible design. And we mean sensible: The doors open wide, there’s good rear-seat legroom even for adults, and there’s a ton of cargo space behind the rear seats.
Exterior StylingSubtle refinements to the exterior distinguish the 2017 Forester from its predecessor. The sleeker headlights incorporate Subaru’s C-shaped LED motif, and the hexagonal grille is also new. The rear lights also accent the C shape. The headlights receive a functional upgrade, with new adaptive headlights that turn with the steering wheel to give better visibility at night. This all adds to the Forester’s already strong attributes. It rides 8.7 inches off the ground, ground clearance that makes it especially good for snowy climates. Turbocharged XT models get a unique front end and a rear roof spoiler, plus 18-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesX-MODE WITH HILL DESCENT CONTROL The X-Mode button on the dash of Limited, Touring and XT models burnishes the Forester’s off-road reputation. Press it, and the car will optimize control of the throttle, AWD, stability and traction control and Hill Descent Control to maximize the Forester’s low-speed on- and off-road potential.
 EYESIGHT DRIVER-ASSIST SYSTEM Improved this year, the available EyeSight system uses two color cameras to view the world ahead, allowing advanced safety features such as pre-collision braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and more.
Standard FeaturesThe base model Forester 2.5i comes standard with all-wheel drive, as well as features you’d expect in a modern car, such as power windows and door locks, air conditioning, cruise control, a multifunction steering wheel, Bluetooth, 6.2-inch Starlink touch-screen audio, variable wipers, 6-speed manual transmission, a rearview camera and color multifunction display. Move up to Premium and you get a panoramic sunroof and alloy wheels, while Limited models also get leather upholstery, automatic climate control and a power liftgate. Touring models get the new interior, plus a heated steering wheel, keyless ignition, an audio upgrade and dual-zone climate control.
Factory OptionsThe CVT is optional on base and Premium models, and from Premium and above you can get the EyeSight driver-assist system, which now includes blind-spot detection and rear cross-path warning. Limited and above can be equipped with the navigation system. Premium models can now be ordered with the power liftgate as well. Touring models come very nicely equipped, with pretty much everything except the navigation system and EyeSight. Then there are the turbocharged XT models, which come in Premium and Touring models. About the only difference is that XT Premium models are available with the navigation system.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available for prospective Forester buyers, both of which are 4-cylinder “boxer” engines. Most Foresters come with a non-turbo 2.5-liter that makes 170 horsepower, backed by either a 6-speed manual transmission or the Lineartronic CVT automatic. Forester 2.0XT SUVs offer more power thanks to a turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter engine. This smaller engine develops 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, routing it to all four wheels through a High-Torque Lineartronic CVT with multi-mode SI-Drive that can emulate six or eight virtual gear ratios. Neither model is particularly well-suited for towing, rated at only 1,500 pounds. The standard 2.5-liter engine can run on regular, 87-octane gasoline, while turbocharged Foresters require at least 91 octane, with 93 octane preferred.

The EyeSight driver-assist system gets more accurate color cameras, plus blind-spot monitoring is now available, and the interior is both more refined and quieter on the highway.
The Subaru Forester’s reputation wasn’t formed on good looks, but on its solid reliability, practical nature and rugged utility. Sound nerdy? Maybe, but that tall greenhouse offers excellent visibility in all directions, and its roomy rear seat and cargo area are two features sometimes lacking in this class. However, the 2017 Subaru Forester has gone to finishing school. Sporting a new nose with LED-accented headlights, an upgraded and quieter interior, and luxurious interior trim packages, the 2017 Forester is shedding the pocket protector for a dash of style. Yet upgrades to the EyeSight driver-assist system, torque vectoring for the turbo model, and improved fuel economy are practical updates that will keep the Forester competitive against the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, and many others.

All benefit from a sporty suspension and sharp steering, from the base models with their 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, mid-level models with their punchier and more efficient turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder, or higher-end models with the 240-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. If you’re looking for an even sportier experience, the new 2017 Fusion Sport offers a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V6 and AWD, while luxury shoppers can opt for the new Platinum model. If you’re more practical than hedonistic, the two different Fusion Hybrids — regular and plug-in — offer fuel-friendly and nicely sorted driving; there’s also a Platinum version of both if you’re in the have-it-and-eat-it camp. The easier-to-use Sync system improves the driving experience of any Fusion model that has it.
Interior ComfortThe new 2017 Fusion Platinum interior, with its stitched dash and premium leather seats with contrast piping, is sumptuous enough to make the Lincoln MKZ feel redundant. Other upgrades this year for the rest of the lineup include a rotary shifter and electronic parking brake. However, Ford has largely kept the roomy 5-passenger interior intact. It’s roomy enough for four adults, three kids can fit in back, and its big trunk holds more than a Honda Accord’s. Hybrid models have a smaller trunk owing to the battery, but even they have a pass-through to the rear seats for longer items.
Exterior StylingThe grille, headlights, lower bumper and taillights on the 2017 Fusion have been reworked subtly, but effectively. It still looks like an Aston Martin, but that’s no bad thing. Platinum models add extra chrome and unique wheels, while Fusion Sport models go for a sporty demeanor with standard fog lights, a mesh grille and charcoal-colored wheels. On a practical note, the clever EasyFuel capless gas-filler system means you’ll never again lose the fuel cap, or have to wrestle it open or closed. Fusion Energi models use a lighted ring around the charge port, with a fully lit ring meaning charging’s complete.
Favorite FeaturesPLUG-IN HYBRID VERSION
With electrification a bigger deal these days, the Fusion Hybrid Energi with its 21 miles of electric-only driving range is a serious player that could let its driver go literally weeks without refueling. But you can still take that road trip thanks to the gasoline engine, and a subsequent 610-mile range.
V6 POWER
Fine, we’re suckers for horsepower, and the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport has it in spades with its 2.7-liter 325-horsepower twin-turbo V6. Coupled with AWD and an even better suspension, the Fusion Sport promises to be an Audi A6 for those on a budget.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2017 Fusion S comes nicely equipped, starting with a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission. On top of that, the Fusion S comes with manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, audio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, a rearview camera, and Ford’s Sync wireless communication system with voice control. Fusion SE models add a 10-way-power driver’s seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system and 17-inch wheels. Higher-end models get the powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, upgraded audio systems, Sync3 with greatly improved usability, and niceties like dual-zone auto climate control, leather seating and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsBesides the two new models — the performance-oriented Fusion Sport and the near-luxury Fusion Platinum — there are plenty of stand-alone options. You can add blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning to help expand driver awareness, and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. There’s a reverse-sensing system to warn you of obstacles, and an Active Park Assist system will actually parallel-park the car for you. All-wheel drive is also available on SE, Titanium, Sport and Platinum models, making it one of the few family sedans ready for foul-weather security in Snowbelt states.
Engine & TransmissionThere are six different ways to motivate your 2017 Fusion. The base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder exists, and you should skip it. Instead, start at the SE sedan, which comes standard with the 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with the option of upgrading to the 2.0-liter version. The 2.0-liter is standard in the Titanium and Platinum models. Fusion Sport comes with a new-for-Fusion 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 with 325 horsepower, making it the most powerful car in its class. The two electrically augmented Fusion models — Fusion Hybrid and Hybrid Energi plug-in — use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission for excellent fuel economy; the Energi has up to 21 miles of EV range. AWD is available with the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder.

There are also changes inside, with a new rotary shifter and upgraded Sync infotainment system. Two new models also debut: the luxury-oriented Platinum, and the sporty, V6-powered Fusion Sport.
For 2017 the new Ford Fusion gets a thorough refresh in the name of keeping it competitive with the class-leading Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Kia Optima. There are also two new models. First is a luxury edition called Fusion Platinum that adds leather on the dash, piped seating and other tech and luxury upgrades. The other is the new Fusion Sport, which adds all-wheel drive (AWD) and a 2.7-liter 325-horsepower V6 engine, blending family-car and sports-sedan sensibilities into one car. The rest of the lineup sticks with 4-cylinder engines, while the two hybrid models — the Fusion Hybrid and plug-in Fusion Hybrid Energi — return to anchor the eco-friendly end of the lineup.

It looks like nothing else on the road, can’t help but put out a fun vibe, and is quite practical thanks to a roomy interior.","ConsIf you think a boxy-looking vehicle should have all-wheel drive, the Soul’s front-drive layout will have you pointed toward the Jeep Renegade or Subaru XV Crosstrek. While the Soul Exclaim packs new muscle, the Honda Civic and Mazda3 and are more fun to drive. The Kia Soul EV, meanwhile, just got upstaged by the new Chevy Bolt.",17000,"Driving the Used 2017 Kia SoulThe good news is that the 2017 Kia Soul Exclaim, with its turbo engine, is definitely quicker than ever. With sharper handling from revised suspension settings and 18-inch alloy wheels, the Soul Turbo packs an edgier experience. The quick and predictable steering still lacks the feedback of a Civic, but it’s acceptable. Power the Soul through a corner and it responds admirably, with less body roll than you’d expect from a tall vehicle. The Turbo’s biggest drawback is the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic paired with the engine. It’s slow to shift up or down, and occasional odd surges of power make it feel like it’s not always fully engaged, even with the Sport drive mode selected. We think the midtrim Plus model, with its non-turbo 2.0-liter engine, will satisfy most drivers. The battery-powered Kia Soul EV has the quiet operation desirable of electric vehicles (EVs), but not the quickness. It takes over 11 seconds for the Kia Soul EV to reach 60 mph. The Chevy Bolt does it in 6.5 seconds and has a range of 238 miles, vs. the Soul EV’s lowly 93.
Interior ComfortThe 2017 Kia Soul offers 5-passenger seating, although four will be more comfortable. Upholstery and trim get notably better as you climb the model ladder, with the Soul Exclaim getting contrast stitching on its cloth and leather seats, plus a sporty D-shaped steering wheel. Available this year are dual USB ports so you can recharge one phone while the other is used for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. The Soul’s boxy shape provides very good headroom for all passengers, and offers good cargo space, especially when you fold the rear seats. The pulsating speaker lights are pure whimsy. Electric models have unique touches, like the State of Charge meter that shows battery level and can be seen through the windshield from outside.
Exterior StylingYou’ll still immediately recognize the 2017 Kia Soul for what it is, but there are a couple of minor tweaks to the exterior. Front and rear bumpers have changed a bit, with the Soul Plus getting body-color inserts, and the Soul Exclaim getting black. The Exclaim also distinguishes itself from its non-turbo mates with 18-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust tips, HID headlights and LED fog lights. The Soul EV has a front charge port hidden behind a solid grille in front. The Kia Soul’s upright styling offers good cargo and passenger space, and the vertical taillights are so distinctive they’re practically the car’s signature.
Favorite FeaturesTURBO POWERWe’ll freely admit that we’re suckers for horsepower, and the new turbocharged engine under the hood of the Kia Soul Exclaim definitely gives the Soul more of its namesake. As a side benefit, fuel economy is actually better than the other engines, meaning you sacrifice almost nothing, aside from extra money.
APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTOApple CarPlay and Android Auto are maybe the best thing to come along in in-car infotainment since speakers. With CarPlay you have access to everything your phone offers, including Apple Music, and with Android Auto you can use Google Maps, all on your car’s infotainment system.
Standard FeaturesThe 2017 Kia Soul comes in three models: Base, Plus (+) and Exclaim (!). Base models include 16-inch alloy wheels, a new drive-mode function, and an updated audio system. Also standard are air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, 6-way-manual-adjust driver’s seat, power windows and door locks and Bluetooth wireless technology. The 2017 Kia Soul EV also comes in three trims: The California-only EV-e3, EV and EV Plus. All come with heated front seats, environmentally-friendly interior materials, DC Fast Charge port, and the ability to start the climate system while the vehicle is still charging.
Factory OptionsOptions vary by model level, with base models with an automatic transmission offering a Convenience Package that adds an updated audio system with a rearview camera, and automatic headlights. Soul Plus models offer an upgraded audio package, and a Primo package that combines a panoramic sunroof, leather seats with power adjustments and heating and cooling in front, blind-spot detection, forward-collision and lane-departure warning, and more. Along with the turbo engine, the Exclaim offers a panoramic sunroof and a Technology package that adds most of what’s in the Primo package, along with a harman/kardon audio system. The top-line Soul EV Plus comes with leather seating and offers a panoramic sunroof.
Engine & TransmissionThe Soul Base model gets a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with a meager 130 horsepower, connected to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. The Soul Plus comes with a more satisfactory 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 161 horsepower connected only to a 6-speed automatic. And of course this year there’s the 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, with its 201 horsepower and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. All Soul models are front-wheel drive and while all are fairly fuel-efficient. The electric Kia Soul EV makes 109 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, significantly less than the Chevy Bolt. The Soul EV also lags by far that upstart’s range: 93 miles vs. 238 for the Bolt. Charge times take from 24 hours on a 120-volt outlet to a more reasonable 4-plus on a 240-volt outlet. DC Fast Charging can be done in about 30 minutes.

Other updates include available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an 8-way-power passenger seat, blind-spot monitoring, additional USB ports, HID headlights, and a new full-color information display between the gauges for the Exclaim.
The 2017 Kia Soul finally receives the one thing it’s lacked since the first hamster-driven 5-door hatchback appeared on our streets: horsepower. The top-level 2017 Soul Exclaim now boasts a 201-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder that delivers the verve the Kia Soul’s funky styling and marketing long promised. Beyond the Turbo model’s extra power, the entire lineup now offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, blind-spot detection, additional USB inputs and more. The all-electric Soul EV touts gas-free driving, but its range is only 93 miles, and availability is limited. The 2017 Soul is a compelling alternative not just to subcompact SUVs like the Fiat 500X or Mini Cooper Countryman, but also the Mazda3, Chevrolet Cruze and Honda Civic hatchbacks, especially when you consider its long warranty and low starting price.

It’s more than just a car. It’s an experience involving all your senses and, if used correctly, your adrenal glands. It’s an SUV that combines performance, style, luxury and cutting-edge technology into possibly the most functional driver’s car of all time.","ConsThe Porsche Cayenne remains exclusive because of its price, high even by Trump standards. The 7-passenger Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 can coddle your family for half the money. Even the Cayenne’s German rivals, such as the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, although less sporting, will give you change back.",995,"Driving the Used 2017 Porsche CayenneThe word ""slow"" has never been used to describe a Porsche Cayenne. Neither have the words “uncomfortable” or “imprecise” or “unrefined.” Cayennes are simply impressive from behind the wheel. Each is a blast to drive. In fact, even the Cayenne S E-Hybrid is a bona fide hoot, zipping to 60 mph in only 5.4 seconds, yet returning an estimated 47 mpge in hybrid electric mode. The Porsche Cayenne GTS, with its turbocharged V6, rockets from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds. The 570-horsepower Turbo S hits 60 mph in about 3.5 seconds. That’s crazy quick. However, there’s much more to the Cayenne than outright speed. Cornering precision is beyond what you should rightfully expect from any SUV, and the 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is tuned to perfection. And it’s all delivered with the refinement of a world-class luxury car.
Interior ComfortPorsche’s interior design and build quality are among the best in the world, combining an artistic aesthetic with sumptuous, finely stitched leather and real wood and metal accents. It’s what you’ll find in newer 911s, as well as Porsche’s Panamera sedan. Rear passengers aren’t forgotten, with a sliding and reclining seat and a pair of LCD screens in the front headrests. While the interior’s beauty is undeniable, the complexity of its numerous buttons, switches and knobs can be confusing, especially when it comes to using the navigation system. Regardless few interiors rank higher, and fewer offer as much cargo room.
Exterior StylingAlthough the 1st-generation Cayenne was popular, it was never going to win any beauty contests. However, this second generation, introduced in 2011, has set the standard for athletic-looking SUVs with sports-car stance and proportions.  From any angle the Cayenne packs an abundance of muscular curves that scream its speed-and-performance mission. A quick field guide to identifying Cayenne models focuses on the brakes: silver calipers denote the Cayenne S and Cayenne S E-Hybrid, and red the high-performance Turbo and GTS models. Turbo S models get the yellow ceramic-brake option as standard. Turbo models also get four exhaust pipes.
Favorite FeaturesPORSCHE TORQUE VECTORING PLUS One of the reasons the new all-wheel-drive Porsche Cayenne doesn’t handle or feel like a ponderous SUV is the Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) system. It sends more power to the outside wheel during cornering, which helps the Cayenne achieve additional traction and higher levels of agility.
 CERAMIC COMPOSITE BRAKES The ultimate high-performance SUV deserves the ultimate high-performance brakes. Brakes with more stopping power, less fade, longer rotor life and bright yellow calipers. Brakes that cost an additional $9,000. That’s right, $9,000.
Standard FeaturesYou can have your new 2017 Porsche Cayenne six ways: There’s the base Cayenne, the S, S E-Hybrid, GTS, Turbo and Turbo S models. All Cayenne models come with all-wheel drive (AWD), water-repellent front side windows, a height-adjustable power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers and a 10-speaker audio system with a 7-inch touch screen. All Cayenne models come with a fuel-saving start/stop function that shuts off the engine at a stop and restarts it when the brake pedal is released. On the safety side, there are six airbags, a full suite of electronic stability aids, and roadside assistance while under warranty.
Factory OptionsThe Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control lets Porsche Cayenne owners take their SUV’s handling to the next level. It adjusts the anti-roll bars in real time to add stiffness to the suspension in response to conditions and whatever drive mode you have selected. A 1,000-watt, 16-speaker Burmester audio system is available for audiophiles, and in-vehicle connectivity includes an Aha Radio smartphone application, which offers a variety of customizable news, music and social networking services. Of course, there’s also that $9,000 brake system.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2017 Porsche Cayenne models come standard with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. However, there are six distinct engines to choose from. The standard Cayenne comes with a strong 3.6-liter V6 engine offering 300 horsepower; however, it’s worth the extra money for the turbocharged versions, either the 420-horsepower Cayenne S or the 440-horsepower Cayenne GTS. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid employs a 333-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6 coupled to a synchronous electric motor, which adds another 95 horsepower to the total. At the top of the line are the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S delivering a whopping 520 and 570 horsepower, respectively, from a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8.

Infiniti has tuned the QX60’s shocks and springs for aggressive driving, which is fine so long as the road remains smooth. Venture over expansion joints or the odd pothole, however, and the ride can become noticeably jarring. Fuel economy is respectable in this class, although you can find nearly identical numbers in a more powerful Audi Q7. Inside, the QX60’s visually pleasing cabin is filled with contrasting colors, soft-touch surfaces and supportive seating including a third row that is actually workable for two adults. Safety features like collision avoidance, lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control are all available, but are not standard.
Interior ComfortThe midsize-luxury-crossover SUV segment has plenty of 3-row vehicles, but Infiniti’s 2017 QX60 luxury SUV stands out because its plush, leather-lined cabin is comfortable in all seven spots. The comfortable front seats make highway miles go by in a flash, and climate, audio and navigation controls are easy to reach and use. The third row is surprisingly accommodating for two adults and, thanks to a second row that slides fore and aft, getting there is easy. Infiniti makes the interior even more pleasing with ample soft-touch materials, and by using laminated glass to make the interior quieter.
Exterior StylingThe 2017 Infiniti QX60’s rounded, sleek design has been recently updated with redesigned headlights and grille, and new fog-light surrounds. The side view shows a gently sloping roof, but that design doesn’t negatively affect the QX60’s impressive interior room. One of the key styling cues of the QX60 is the bowed window frame at the back of the side windows. A smaller version of this design detail can also be seen on Infiniti’s stunning Q60 coupe. In back, the power-operated tailgate, which comes standard, makes it easier to load and unload gear and groceries.
Favorite FeaturesPREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING While many cars offer collision warning and intervention systems, the 2017 Infiniti QX60’s system has the ability to look at the car beyond the one in front of you, thus anticipating situations in which the driver directly ahead will likely respond.
 DISTANCE CONTROL ASSIST Bumper-to-bumper traffic is now a part of everyday life, which is why the QX60’s Distance Control Assist can make the drive a little less stressful. Should you become momentarily distracted, DCA keeps an appropriate space between your car and the car ahead, eliminating the possibility of a minor fender-bender.
Standard FeaturesBuyers expect a luxury SUV to come equipped with a bevy of standard features. And even the least expensive QX60 is nicely appointed, with features like heated, power-folding side mirrors; moonroof, and a power liftgate. Inside, all QX60s come with a leather interior with heated and power-adjustable front seats, tri-zone temperature control, Bluetooth and USB ports, power tilt/telescoping steering column, rearview camera with 7-inch screen and 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio. Some optional features in the regular QX60 are standard in the Hybrid, which also has a system that emits a sound to notify pedestrians that the otherwise hushed vehicle is there.
Factory OptionsYou can choose gas or hybrid, and front- or all-wheel drive, but many of the other options are bundled into packages. Navigation is optional, as are a 15-speaker Bose audio system, heated seats in the second row, a motion-activated power liftgate, Wi-Fi, auto high beams, heated steering wheel, a moonroof over the second and third rows and a rear-seat entertainment package. There are also a lot of available safety features, including blind-spot monitoring, intelligent cruise control, lane-departure warning and prevention, and systems that can automatically apply the brakes when traveling in both forward and reverse.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2017 Infiniti QX60 is powered by a smooth, 295-horsepower V6 linked to a CVT automatic transmission. This Infiniti has a Drive Mode Selector, which offers four modes — Standard, Sport, Eco and Snow. The transmission also has a manual mode that simulates shifting gears. Under the hood of the 2017 QX60 Hybrid, you’ll find a 2.5-liter supercharged 4-cylinder engine that, in combination with a 15kW electric motor, has a net power output of 250 horsepower. It, too, is fitted with a continuously variable transmission. Whether you are looking at the V6 version of the QX60 or the hybrid, you can choose between FWD and AWD. Towing capacity is rated at a laudable 5,000 pounds for V6 models and 3,500 pounds for the hybrid.

Stern ride aside, the QX60 offers a powerful V6 engine, choice of front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD) and styling that truly stands out from other luxury SUVs. The QX60 Hybrid offers slightly better fuel economy with similar performance, but as gasoline looks to remain cheap for the near future, we’re not certain the extra cost and technology are worth the added premium.

ConsIf you’re looking for a midsize SUV with maximum toting/towing capabilities, the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander all offer more of both. And for those who think bigger really is better but still favor the GMC brand, the full-size Yukon may be the best choice of all.",30000,"Driving the Used 2017 GMC AcadiaA smaller footprint and significant weight drop impart a new level of dynamic appeal to the remade Acadia in every configuration. Its measured rescaling to true midsize status trims the turning circle by nearly two feet, which makes the Acadia notably easier to maneuver in parking lots or other tight confines. Although still biased more toward utility than sport, the Acadia’s new platform underpinnings — including available Continuously Variable Ride Control on Denali models — also raise its agility index when the going gets twisty while improving overall comfort and confidence during highway cruise mode. The new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is more than adequate for light-duty work, particularly in a front-drive configuration. However, buyers with anything more ambitious in mind — including opting for all-wheel drive (AWD) — would be better served by stepping up to the new 3.6-liter V6 that offers notably more power and torque with a minimal fuel economy penalty.
Interior ComfortAlthough its absolute scale has been trimmed a bit, the 2017 Acadia SUV’s cabin boasts an even more upscale character helped by a modern design that includes additional soft-touch surfaces, upgraded trim and active noise cancellation. Despite a wheelbase that now matches the compact 5-passenger GMC Terrain, the Acadia’s new architecture still allows for three adult-accommodating rows of seats. The second tier — 60-40 bench or Captain’s Chairs — features an upgraded Smart Slide system for easier access to the 50/50 third row and both fold flat to expand the fairly modest 12.8 cu. ft. of base cargo space to a quite usable 79.0 cu. ft. maximum.
Exterior StylingThe Acadia remake introduces a more sophisticated but still substantial look that’s skewed more towards contemporary crossover than conventional SUV. Subtle evolutions of established GMC design cues carry over in its grille, fascia treatments, fender arches and various other details, but the Acadia’s bodywork now features rounder and more aerodynamic contours and the windshield has an even sleeker rake. The primo Denali amps up its curb appeal with distinctive lighting treatments, shiny 20-inch alloy wheels and an extra dose of brightwork while the new All-Terrain signifies its more adventurous character with black chrome accenting and dark-tint 18-inch or 20-inch rims.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVE MODE SELECTORA new feature on all Acadias, the Drive Mode Selector offers a choice of settings to optimize the powertrain and suspension response under all conditions, including a dedicated Trailer/Tow mode. The on-demand AWD system also features a fuel-saving 2×4 with positive AWD disconnect while All-Terrain models replace the Off-Road mode with an All-Terrain setting.
ALL-TERRAIN MODELThe new Acadia All-Terrain matches V6 power with a bespoke Active Twin Clutch all-wheel-drive system that enhances traction on all surfaces and improves uphill climbing capability. The 5-passenger All-Terrain also features Hill Descent Control and swaps its 3rd-row seats for covered rear storage bins and a cargo management system.
Standard FeaturesEven the base Acadia SL comes with tri-zone auto climate control, numerous power assists, a 7.0-inch Color Touch Screen, Keyless Open and Start, 5-year OnStar Basic Plan, support for Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, five USB ports and the industry’s first rear-seat reminder safety alert system to prevent leaving kids or other valuables from being left behind. Moving up through the SLE/SLT ranks introduces everything from a power liftgate, 8.0-inch touchscreen with IntelliLink and SiriusXM Satellite Radio to leather upholstery, Bose audio and Navigation. The Denali and All-Terrain add distinctive cosmetic/convenience touches plus a full range of new driver assists.
Factory OptionsThe Acadia’s extras roster relates to its trim grade, with no AWD available on the entry-level SL. But the SLE-1 can be had with that and a rear-seat entertainment system while the SLE-2 offers Bose sound, upgraded infotainment choices and the Dual SkySkape 2-panel panoramic sunroof. It also offers a new Driver Alert Package I that brings Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Rear Park Assist, all of which are found in the Denali’s more comprehensive — and standard — Driver Alert Package II that adds Pedestrian Detection and Forward Collision Alert with Low-Speed Automatic Braking.
Engine & TransmissionThe Acadia offers two new naturally aspirated engines, both backed by a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic. Sole motivator in the base front-wheel-drive-only SL and standard in the SLE-1/SLE-2/SLT-1 models, the new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder makes 194 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. The first GMC engine to feature Start-Stop technology, it earns GM-estimated 21/26-mpg EPA City/Highway marks in front-wheel drive (FWD) Acadia models and 21/25 in AWD variants. The new 3.6-liter V6 standard in all other Acadias makes a considerably stouter 310 horses and 271 lb-ft of torque but features Active Fuel Management that turns it into a V4 under light loads. It nets GM-estimated 18/25 mpg EPA numbers in both FWD and AWD configurations while raising the Acadia’s max tow rating from 1,000 to a still-modest 4,000 pounds.

Redesigned from the ground up, the 2017 GMC Acadia boasts a sleeker look, enhanced technology and greater efficiency in a slightly smaller and significantly lighter package that “strategically repositions” this midsize SUV to further separate it from GMC’s full-size Yukon. Based on all-new platform architecture that also underpins the new Cadillac XT5, the recast Gen II Acadia still has 3-row seating for up to seven and generous cargo space but packs it into a more maneuverable and driver-friendly configuration. As part of its comprehensive recasting, the 2017 Acadia also gains a host of new assist systems and now offers a new 4-cylinder engine choice as well as its traditional V6, front-drive or a sophisticated 4-wheel drive system and a new off-road-focused All-Terrain variant.

Those seeking even better ride and handling might like the new Mazda CX-9.
What's New?For 2017, Hyundai’s Santa Fe 7-passenger SUV receives updated exterior and interior styling. New standard features include a 7-inch touch screen with Android Auto, rearview camera and Driver Select Mode. New options include a Multi-View Camera, Dynamic Bending Headlights with auto high-beam assist, Smart Cruise Control and Automatic Emergency Braking.
There are many feelings owners associate with the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV, but buyer’s remorse is not one of them. A freshened exterior and more standard features make Hyundai’s 2017 Santa Fe even more appealing this year, helping it keep pace with newer competitors like the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Mazda CX-9. Offering up one of the most powerful V6 engines in its class along with ample interior room and a comfortable 3rd-row seat, the Santa Fe should appeal to those needing room, although the GMC Acadia still offers vastly more cargo space behind its 3rd-row seat. Add in a 5,000-pound tow rating and Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, and the Santa Fe begins to look like the deal of the decade.
Used 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe PricingA 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SE comes out of the gate with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of around $31,695 — a number that is slightly higher than the 2017 Nissan Pathfinder SUV, but slightly less than a similarly equipped Honda Pilot EX. The 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited starts just shy of $36,000. If you load up an AWD Santa Fe Ultimate Limited with every option, you’ll still find yourself spending less than $45,000. Check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price for what shoppers are actually paying for the Santa Fe in your area. It’s still a little early to predict the 2017 Santa Fe’s resale outlook, but Hyundai SUVs consistently rank well versus their competition, on par with the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer, better than the GMC Acadia but behind the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.
Driving the Used 2017 Hyundai Santa FeWhile Mazda’s CX-9 may have set a new standard for 7-passenger SUV handling, the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV isn’t far from this benchmark. The Santa Fe offers more horsepower than the Mazda and features Drive Mode Select, a 3-position setting that permits the driver to change steering feel and transmission shift points ranging from Economy to Comfort to Sport mode. The Santa Fe’s suspension settings permit confident cornering devoid of excessive sway while simultaneously avoiding too harsh a ride. Interior sound levels are more than acceptable, although we think the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer do a better job. As for power, the 2017 Santa Fe’s 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 delivers when it counts most, with excellent off-the-line acceleration and ample power for low-speed passing maneuvers. All-wheel drive (AWD) does add more weight and thus a very slight reduction in acceleration times over the front-wheel-drive (FWD) models.
Interior ComfortThere’s plenty of room in the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe, and the driver’s front view is panoramic (the rearward view is less broad, but you’re never reduced to driving purely with the mirrors). The base model’s stain-resistant cloth fabric feels good, plus the audio and climate-control knobs and buttons are glove-friendly big. All materials are impressive down to the rubber that lines the inside of the door pulls. The first two rows are completely livable for adults, while the third row is a decent kid’s row. The Santa Fe does give up some cargo area compared to the competition, however.
Exterior StylingLooking for all the world like what it is — an extended-wheelbase Santa Fe Sport without the sporty rear-side-window kick-up — the new Santa Fe has more to say about handsome, contemporary styling than it does about swooping lines that characterize the shapes of Hyundai passenger cars. Nice touch 1: Even in base SE form, the outside mirrors and bumpers are body-color. Integrated fog lights, roof rails and 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels are the exterior differences between the SE and upscale Limited versions. Nice touch 2: The Santa Fe SE gets smaller 18-inch wheels, but at least they are aluminum-alloy.
Favorite FeaturesHYUNDAI BLUE LINK TELEMATICS Standard on every 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe, the next-generation Blue Link telematics offers a wide range of driver assists, including turn-by-turn navigation, remote start, stolen-vehicle recovery, SOS emergency assistance and onboard diagnostic info.
 PANORAMIC SUNROOF What better way to perk up a crowded cabin than with a massive infusion of sunlight. The Santa Fe’s available panoramic sunroof spans all three rows and can be tilted up for improved ventilation or opened for a refreshing blast of fresh air. 
Standard FeaturesSanta Fe SE drivers with a long journey ahead will appreciate the multi-adjustable front bucket seats with power-adjustable lumbar support. Passengers farther back will give thanks to the 3rd-row controls for air conditioning and heating. Stepping up to the Santa Fe Limited includes luxuries like leather seating — power-adjustable and heated for the driver and front passenger — push-button starting and an electroluminescent gauge cluster. The Limited Ultimate adds heated 2nd-row seats, an 8-inch-color navigation touch-screen monitor and Multi-View Monitor. Sweet as ever, Hyundai’s confidence-inspiring 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranties cover the new Santa Fe.
Factory OptionsBeyond a laundry list of bundled options like a heated steering wheel, navigation system, Infinity premium audio, 3rd-row USB ports and AWD, Hyundai is pushing a few new packages. For the Santa Fe SE, the Premium package brings blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, hands-free Smart liftgate and more. The Tech package for the SE Ultimate and Limited Ultimate include Smart Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, lane-departure warning, electronic parking brake and HID Dynamic Bending Headlights with high-beam assist.
Engine & TransmissionHyundai makes it simple to shop for a 7-passenger 2017 Santa Fe SUV by offering only one engine and one transmission. In FWD form, the SUV’s 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 is very well matched to the 6-speed automatic transmission, with good throttle response, smooth pickup and clean, easy shifts. The AWD Santa Fe, though, could do with some more low-end grunt to get it moving. All that said, Hyundai’s 2017 Santa Fe is comfortable towing up to 5,000 pounds of trailer, boat or anything else you’d like to haul.  3.3-liter V6 290 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm 252 lb-ft of torque @ 5,200 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (FWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD)

The Ram 1500 offers a fuel-efficient diesel engine. And if any of those are too big, there’s the midsize Chevy Colorado with its own diesel engine.",27800,"Driving the Used 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabThe lack of wind and road noise at speed in the 2016 Silverado could just have you forgetting you’re driving a full-size pickup truck. The suspension easily soaks up big dips, although sometimes it’s too much of a good thing, and the suspension feels a little too soft. Still, the steering is light and precise, and the Silverado isn’t particularly ponderous in parking situations. Three engines are available, with a fuel-efficient (but pokey) V6 anchoring the bottom, and a powerful (but thirsty) 6.2-liter V8 in the top-level High Country. In between is a 5.3-liter V8, now available with GM’s excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. Its smooth shifts come more quickly, helping acceleration, and it lets the engine turn at a lower rpm on the highway, giving it the same fuel economy as the Ford F-150’s 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine. We do wish all engines responded more quickly to the throttle, though.
Interior ComfortEven more basic models of the new Chevy Silverado benefit from the sensible layout and ample storage, and the plastics are nicely textured and feel upscale. Of course, if you opt for higher-end models, you get higher-end materials, with the High Country models laying on the luxury nice and thick. There are three cab styles, with passenger capacity ranging from three in regular cabs to up to six in double-cab or crew-cab configurations. With up to five USB plugs, two 12-volt ports and a 110-volt outlet, the Silverado can juice several devices.
Exterior StylingThe new exterior styling is easily the most noticeable change from last year. The 2016 Silverado not only has a new grille, but the design itself changes from trim level to trim level. The LTZ gets an especially chromed-up look, while the standard Silverado sports a more subdued look. We’re particularly fond of the new Z71, which sports a body-color insert in the grille instead of more chrome. No matter what, the bluff-faced look is sharp, especially with the new LED-enhanced headlights. The hood also has more contouring than last year, giving the driver a more dramatic outward view.
Favorite FeaturesNEW STYLINGThe new styling on the 2016 Silverado incorporates clever and cool headlights, and the grille designs are distinct from trim level to trim level. It visually separates the Silverado not just from its competition, but also from its predecessor.
APPLE CARPLAYThis is one of our new favorite things. Not only does Apple CarPlay integrate your compatible smartphone quickly and easily with the Silverado, it makes many of your phone’s primary functions available on the touch screen. A bonus: listening to Siri read out emojis will have your kids (and you) laughing.
Standard FeaturesStarting at the lowest-end 2016 Silverado WT, you get the basics, such as air conditioning, power windows, cruise control and AM/FM audio system with 4.2-inch display and inputs for USB, auxiliary jack and SD card. It also includes the Silverado’s new projector-beam headlights and LED accents, and the CornerStep cutout on the rear bumper to make it easier to access the truck’s bed. Safety equipment includes front, side and curtain airbags, anti-lock brakes and stability control. All new Silverados also include two years/24,000 miles of complimentary factory-scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsAside from picking either a 5.3-liter or 6.2-liter V8 engine over the standard 4.3-liter V6 for your 2016 Silverado, there are an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic, rear- or 4-wheel drive, and bed and cabin size to consider. Luxury-truck buyers should start with the High Country, with its big V8, leather upholstery, navigation, Apple CarPlay, a premium audio system, and more. CarPlay is also available in the nicely equipped LT and LTZ models. One option that isn’t available at any price is push-button ignition, odd since it’s available in the Silverado-based Tahoe SUV.
Engine & TransmissionThe three engines for the 2016 Chevy Silverado remain the same. There’s the base 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6, while the 5.3-liter V8 powers higher trims, with the High Country getting a 6.2-liter V8 with up to 12,000 pounds of towing power. All engines are available with 4-wheel drive (4WD) instead of the standard 2-wheel-drive (2WD) setup. Standard on the V6 and 5.3-liter V8 is a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2-liter V8 and 5.3-liter V8 LTZ models get an 8-speed automatic. All three of the engines run on regular unleaded, and the V6 and 5.3-liter V8 are flex-fuel compliant, meaning they can use the E85 ethanol blend.

The 2016 Silverado also gets Apple CarPlay, making it the only full-size pickup with the technology. Lastly, GM’s excellent 8-speed automatic transmission is available with the 5.3-liter V8 engine.
The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado looks like a brand-new truck, two years after it actually was redesigned. The new grille, headlights, hood and taillights break away from the handsome-but-bland styling of the past couple of years and give the new Silverado the double-take good looks it has needed. But there’s more under the skin in the form of an 8-speed automatic transmission, now available with the 5.3-liter V8 engine for the first time. Apple’s excellent new CarPlay iPhone integration is now available as well, along with a host of smaller refinements.

Infotainment updates include VW Car Net, which is now compatible with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink. SE trims gain a rearview camera.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this vehicle’s diesel engine is involved in a Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act issued by the EPA to Volkswagen for producing and selling 4-cylinder diesel cars that include a software device that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. The EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these diesel cars emit up to 40 times more pollution than emission standards allow. Recalls, investigations and litigation are currently ongoing.
As Volkswagen’s best seller, the 2016 Jetta sedan runs the gamut, including a simple economy car, performance-oriented sedan and fuel-sipping hybrid and diesel models. The Jetta can also be equipped with the latest driver-assist features, such as adaptive cruise control and autonomous emergency braking. Compared to the Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla, the Jetta offers a more upscale interior, better handling plus some of the best fuel-economy figures of any midsize sedan. Of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention the current dark cloud hanging over the TDI clean-diesel models. How the outcome will affect the car’s fuel-economy ratings and power output is yet to be determined, as is any hit to its once-enviable resale.
Used 2016 Volkswagen Jetta PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) range can turn a Jetta into a sub-$20,000 economy car or a $30,000-plus sedan with features and performance nearing that of an entry-level luxury car. The Jetta Hybrid comes fully loaded at around $32,000. Those seeking a fuel-sipper can opt for a TDI diesel model, starting around $22,500 with the manual transmission. In lower trims, the Jetta is in good company with the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda3, Chevrolet Cruze and Subaru Impreza, but can’t quite reach the lower starting prices of the Nissan Sentra, Dodge Dart and Kia Forte. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Jetta. In predicted resale value, the VW Jetta’s is expected to be marginal to good, with the diesels’ fate unknown for now and hybrid models at the bottom of the pack.
Driving the Used 2016 Volkswagen JettaThe driving experience behind the wheel of a 2016 VW Jetta sedan varies greatly depending on the trim. A new 1.4-liter turbo in the S and SE delivers good acceleration and great fuel economy, while the 1.8-liter turbo delivers more punch with nearly identical fuel economy. The TDI diesel is surprisingly quick thanks to its abundant torque, but it’s the 210-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo in the GLI that makes the Jetta sports sedan worthy. Looking for the best of both worlds? Try the 1.4-liter turbo and electric-assist motor in the Jetta Hybrid. Common traits for all Jettas are excellent road manners, responsive steering and brakes and a penchant for tackling tight turns. While the GLI is the best handling of the bunch, its ride can be harsh. We actually like the TDI diesel’s performance, but until we learn more, we’d say go with the Hybrid or 1.8T.
Interior ComfortFor a compact car, the 5-passenger 2016 Jetta sedan by Volkswagen has good interior space, although rear-seat legroom lags behind the Hyundai Elantra and Chevy Cruze. Especially notable is the amount of cargo space behind the rear seat. At 15.5 cubic feet, the sedan’s trunk is in a higher league, and when you need even more room the rear seats fold. Design-wise, the Jetta’s interior could be called “minimalist-chic.” Advanced technology and a plethora of high-quality materials are laid out in a simple, easy-to-use format devoid of multiple buttons and overly complicated screens.
Exterior StylingThe latest Jetta is stylishly conservative compared to such design-focused competitors as the Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and even the 2016 Dodge Dart. Indeed, compared to the many entrants in this segment, it’s the Jetta and Chevrolet Cruze dressed as the adults at the dinner party. Is that appealing? Depends whether you’re more Josh Groban or Bruno Mars. If you’re in the camp of the former, you’ll like the Jetta’s clean lines that we expect to age well. GLI versions increase the excitement level with a dynamic new front end, 18-inch alloy wheels, smoked taillights and dual exhaust tips.
Favorite FeaturesGLI VW’s 2016 Jetta GLI is one of the best sports sedans money can buy. Fast, efficient and more fun than usually evoked by 4-doors, this is one front-drive family sedan that will prompt frequent arguments over who gets to be in the driver’s seat.
1.4T TURBOCHARGED GASOLINE ENGINEThe newest turbocharged engine in the Jetta fleet replaces the anemic 115-horsepower 2.0-liter from last year and all we can say is “good riddance.” The 1.4T offers up robust acceleration and a 40-mpg highway rating when equipped with the manual transmission.
Standard FeaturesSpend the very least on VW’s 2016 VW Jetta S, and you’ll get basics like air conditioning, power windows/doors/mirrors, keyless entry, 15-inch steel wheels, Bluetooth and an AM/FM/CD audio with 5-inch color touch screen. Spend roughly $2,000 more for the SE model and you’ll not only get a great engine, but cruise control, Leatherette interior with heated front seats, push-button start, heated washer nozzles and 6-speaker sound system with iPod adapter. SEL trims bring navigation, power driver’s seat, Fender premium audio, automatic climate control and keyless access and start. Complimentary maintenance is covered for two years/24,000 miles.
Factory OptionsAside from a 6-speed automatic transmission, most extras in the 2016 Jetta sedan are had by climbing trims. Among them are sunroof, navigation system, VW’s Car-Net connectivity service, push-button start, touch-screen radio, power driver’s seat and rearview camera. At around $30,000, top-line GLI and Hybrid models bring sparkling bi-xenon headlights, automatic climate control and Fender premium audio system. The Driver Assistance System includes blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision warning, park-distance control and new this year, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking.
Engine & TransmissionFive engines are offered for VW’s 2016 Jetta sedan. Used only on the base S and SE sedan is a 1.4-liter direct-injection turbo connected to a 5-speed manual transmission or 6-speed automatic with Sport mode. You can move up a trim to obtain VW’s zesty 1.8-liter turbocharged-4, also connected to a 5-speed manual or 6-speed auto. GLI models use the most powerful engine in the lineup, a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that makes 210 horsepower. Its transmission choices are 6-speed manual or 6-speed auto. The Hybrid employs a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and electric motor, and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Like the GLI, hybrid models require premium fuel. The efficient TDI models use a 2.0-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder connected to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic.

With such available features as ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel, you may think you’ve accidently purchased a European luxury sedan.","ConsCompared to its competitors, the 2016 Chrysler 200 sedan’s 4-cylinder engine is neither potent nor terribly refined. The 200 is also saddled with one of the smallest rear seats in the midsize family-sedan segment.",23000,"Driving the Used 2016 Chrysler 200Our time in the 2016 Chrysler 200C with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine left us with lukewarm feelings. The engine’s 184 horsepower takes a long time to show up in full force, and there is a lack of refinement not experienced with other 4-cylinders in this segment, chiefly the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Thankfully, the 200 has a savior in the form of its available 3.6-liter V6 engine, one of the most powerful and efficient V6s offered in a family sedan. Teamed with Chrysler’s new 9-speed automatic, the V6-powered 200 goes from mild-mannered 4-door to athletic touring sedan, especially when the transmission is placed in Sport mode. Steering is extremely precise and the handling is better than most in this class. Those seeking the ultimate driving experience will want the 200S model for its sport-tuned suspension and more aggressive wheel-and-tire package.
Interior ComfortAs we just touched on above, Chrysler’s 200 for 2016 features one of the most refined and tasteful interiors in the midsize-sedan segment. Available power-adjustable seats in leather can be fitted with heated and ventilated elements, and for 2016 have added padding for a firmer feel. Interior accents like real wood with an exposed edge stretching across the dashboard give the 200 a refined feel on the inside. Regrettably, all the luxury in the world can’t compensate for the 200’s smallish rear seat and snug headroom.
Exterior StylingBoasting a coupe-like profile, the Chrysler’s 2016 200 sedan’s sleek lines guide your eyes from the front to the back of the 4-door. Up front, the new Chrysler badge appears to be floating in the grille and is flanked by projector-beam headlights. Aiming for a ""timeless, exciting"" look, the company is using this fresh design as a template for the face of future Chrysler products.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe 2016 Chrysler 200’s all-wheel drive setup employs a detachable rear axle. Unlike the Subaru Legacy, the 200’s system doesn’t create fuel-consuming drag when AWD is not needed.
INTERIORIf you appreciate thoughtful design and an elegant use of lighting, leather and wood, you’ll love what Chrysler has done with the 2016 200 sedan. From its intricate seat sew patterns to the satin-finished rotary gear selector, the 200’s interior shuns the bland and boring.
Standard FeaturesMulti-stage airbags, Uconnect infotainment with a USB port, keyless entry and start (no need to ever take the key out of your pocket or purse), stability and traction control, anti-lock brakes, Brake Assist, an electronic parking brake and cruise control are just a few of the 2016 Chrysler 200’s notable standard features.
Factory OptionsThe SafetyTec package will set you back $1,295, but brings features like Advanced Brake Assist, rain-sensing windshield wipers, Full Speed Forward Collision Warning Plus, Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go, Blind Spot Monitoring, and Park Assist along with it. The other optional package we recommend springing for is Navigation and Sound Group 1 ($1,395). This includes features like navigation, HD radio and an 8.4-inch Uconnect touch screen.
Engine & TransmissionIf it’s fuel efficiency you’re after in your 2016 Chrysler 200 sedan, then we recommend going with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine – while it’s a little short on power, it makes up for that in mpg. The 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine, on the other hand, serves up power much quicker, but fuel economy does suffer a tad. No matter which engine you decide to go with, though, a new 9-speed automatic transmission rows through the gears allowing for highway fuel economy to stretch out.

Cars equipped with the 8.4-inch Uconnect touch screen include a new Drag and Drop menu bar and Siri Eyes Free. The V6 engine is now available on the Limited trim.
There are many midsize family sedans from which to choose, but in the 2016 Chrysler 200 sedan, you’ll find an elegant and luxurious contender whose price tag will come as a pleasant surprise. More stylized than a Honda Accord, the Chrysler 200’s skin is better suited to comparisons with the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Chevrolet Malibu. Available with a choice of 4- or 6-cylinder engines, front or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD) and loaded with the latest safety innovations and high-tech infotainment, the only missing element in the 200 stable is a hybrid model. Although its 4-cylinder engine is not the smoothest or most powerful in this class, the available Pentastar V6 is just the opposite, turning the 200 into a potent contender with breathtaking acceleration.

But, good luck trying to match the Legacy’s interior dimensions, fuel economy, standard features, excellent reliability ratings and price. Hint: It can’t be done.","ConsAs good as it is, the 2016 Subaru Legacy has no answer to the Toyota Camry or Ford Fusion hybrids, nor can it challenge the Volkswagen Passat TDI diesel. New designs such as the Chevrolet Malibu and Chrysler 200 shine brightly when compared to the conservatively styled Legacy sedan.",22500,"Used 2016 Subaru Legacy PricingSubaru’s 2016 Legacy AWD sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $22,500 for a base 2.5i model. At the other end of the spectrum is the 3.6R Limited model that starts at $30,750 and can reach the mid-$30K mark with options. The Legacy’s prices are in line with competitors such as the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Ford Fusion. The Legacy’s real value differentiator is the fact that all models come with all-wheel drive. Only two other rivals even offer it – the Ford Fusion and Chrysler 200 – and equipping them with the feature costs significantly more. An AWD Fusion begins around $27,000, while an AWD Chrysler 200 begins at nearly $30,000. Before buying your 2016 Legacy sedan, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. In the long-run, the Legacy has a history of high resale value.
Driving the Used 2016 Subaru LegacyBecause the 2016 Subaru Legacy sedan’s boxer engine sits deep in the engine bay, the car itself has a lower center of gravity and therefore improved stability in the turns. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder performs on par with other 4-cylinder cars in this class, but the continuously variable transmission (CVT) makes it feel more responsive than its 175-horsepower rating suggests. Still, if you desire power for rapid acceleration and confident passing, it’s the 6-cylinder’s robust 256 horsepower that is required. However, opting for the larger engine negates the smaller engine’s impressive 36 mpg. In the turns, the Legacy’s suspension allows more lean than in a Ford Fusion or Mazda6, but it never feels out of control or unstable. In fact, the Legacy delivers the kind of smooth ride most buyers are looking for. If you want all-out performance, perhaps Subaru’s WRX is a better choice.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Legacy sedan’s 5-passenger cabin feels contemporary, useful and entertaining. A handsome center stack includes a 6.2-inch touch-screen infotainment system with standard rearview camera. Passenger space is generous front and rear, and the Legacy’s trunk capacity sits at an impressive 15.0 cubic feet. Most controls are intuitive, and the upgraded command screen features multi-touch-and-swipe technology, like a tablet. Phone-pairing is easy. The driver’s seat has good lumbar support, but even at its lowest setting may be too much for some people. Rear-seat legroom is generous and on Limited trims, the rear seats are heated.
Exterior StylingIn the past few years, the midsize-sedan segment has started to look like a beauty pageant, with automakers vying to one-up each other with style and pizazz. In this contest, the Subaru Legacy earns the title of Miss Congeniality – or perhaps Mr. Conservative. In that, Subaru’s latest Legacy remains handsome but not flashy. If there’s a trend it follows, it’s that of a big, trapezoidal grille. In back, 6-cylinder models are distinguished by dual stainless-steel exhaust outlets. All Subaru Legacy models for 2016 have good visibility thanks to thoughtful details like a small window below the A-pillar.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVE AND UP TO 36 MPGSubaru’s 2016 Legacy family sedan uses every trick in the book to eke out maximum fuel economy, including active grille shutters that close for better aerodynamics and an advanced CVT transmission. With an EPA estimated 36 mpg highway, the Legacy is the most fuel-efficient AWD midsize sedan on the market.
LEAD VEHICLE ALERTYou’re sitting at stoplight, filling the time by searching for that errant French fry that fell between the seats. Then the light turns green, and you miss it. But Lead Vehicle Alert doesn’t. It senses when the car ahead of you has moved and alerts you to do the same.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Legacy from Subaru comes in four trims: 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, 2.5i Limited and 3.6R Limited. The entry-level 2.5i is a well-equipped sedan with CVT automatic transmission with paddle shifters, a 6.2-inch infotainment system with AM/FM/CD/HD Radio, Bluetooth streaming and USB/auxiliary inputs, rearview camera and 17-inch wheels. Premium models add a 10-way-power driver’s seat, heated front seats, upgraded infotainment with a 7-inch screen and two USB ports, dual-zone climate control, and faux-wood trim. Limited trims have a 576-watt harman/kardon audio system, blind-spot and lane-departure warning, and leather. Top-line 3.6R models come with the 6-cylinder engine and HID headlights.
Factory OptionsMost of the Legacy’s options are bundled into packages and include a power moonroof, navigation, a rear-vehicle detection system with cross-traffic alert, keyless access and push-button start. Subaru’s EyeSight driver-assist system offers adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane-departure warning, Lane Keep Assist and Lead Vehicle Alert. One particularly interesting option, called PIN Code Access, allows you to leave the keys in the parked car and lock and unlock the vehicle with a code via a button near the trunk. The feature is aimed at runners, swimmers and others who don’t want to carry keys with them.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engine choices are available in the 2016 Subaru Legacy sedan: a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder or 3.6-liter 6-cylinder. Both engines have a horizontal or ""boxer"" configuration. It’s called the latter because with engine’s horizontal position, the pistons move sideways in and out, similar to a boxer’s fists. This configuration reduces vehicle vibration and lowers the Subaru’s center of gravity for a stable feel. All Legacy models now use the CVT, which has been refined to feel more like a regular automatic transmission. Fuel economy has been improved in both engines for this new model year, and both can run on regular 87-octane gasoline.

Steering feel has been enhanced for all models and a new auto on/off feature operates both the headlights and windshield wipers.
In the world of family sedans, Subaru’s Legacy has gone from being a niche player to a genuine contender. Every bit as roomy, comfortable and efficient as a Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, the Subaru Legacy sedan for 2016 bests the competition by offering all-wheel drive (AWD) as standard equipment. An appealing design wrapped around a voluminous interior peppered with the latest infotainment and driver-assist technology, Subaru’s Legacy sedan for 2016 is the consummate family 4-door. The Legacy’s 4-cylinder engine is both peppy and fuel efficient, but there is a smooth and powerful 6-cylinder for those who prefer potent passing power to miserly fuel consumption. And, the AWD Legacy costs less than a front-drive Accord or Camry, with a starting price around"

What's New?Now two years into its current generation, the 2016 Mazda6 receives an updated interior that includes a larger 7-inch touch screen, a sport mode on automatic transmission models, and an electronic parking brake. Exterior revisions include a new grille and available LED headlights.
The 2016 Mazda6 may not have the massive market share of best-selling rivals like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, but in the competitive midsize sedan market, it still stands out. True to Mazda’s ""Zoom-Zoom"" boasts, the Mazda6’s calling card is its athletic nature. Among the 11 family sedans comprising this segment, the Mazda6 is arguably the most fun to drive. Its 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine isn’t a powerhouse, but it is remarkably fuel-efficient. Rather than relying on brute force, the Mazda’s dynamic performance is enabled by its light weight, impressive cornering ability, and a satisfying 6-speed manual transmission for do-it-yourselfers. Stylish design is also part of the Mazda6’s appeal, but its 5-passenger interior can feel somewhat confined.
Used 2016 MAZDA MAZDA6 PricingThe 2016 Mazda6 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $22,300 for a manual transmission Sport model. As mentioned, we think spending the extra $1,500 for the automatic transmission version of that model or stepping up to the Touring trim that starts at about $24,800 is the better value. At the top end of the Mazda6 range is the Grand Touring model starting just over $31,000 and reaching $35,000, fully loaded. At these prices, the Mazda6 is in line with competitors such as the Accord, Camry, Ford Fusion, Nissan Altima, Subaru Legacy and Chrysler 200. Starting slightly less are the Hyundai Sonata and Volkswagen Passat. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Mazda6. In the coming years Mazda’s midsize car is expected to hold its value well, but still trail leaders like the Legacy and Camry.
Driving the Used 2016 MAZDA MAZDA6We admit there were times during our testing of the Mazda6 that we wished it had a little more oomph. Competitors offer this in the form of larger V6 engines or turbocharged 4-cylinder powerplants. But the majority of family sedan buyers will opt for standard 4-cylinder engines, and as such, Mazda’s 184-horsepower 2.5-liter will meet most expectations. Moreover, the ""more with less"" nature of its Skyactiv technology (see below) plays well into the Mazda6’s overall dynamic synergy. Its sporty suspension, light-yet-strong body and excellent braking ability make for an engaging and enjoyable sedan. The fully electric power steering has excellent feedback and a relatively quick 15.5:1 ratio. As for overall comfort, we found the big 19-inch wheels and tire package on Touring and Grand Touring models a bit harsh. Opting for the lower-priced Sport trim brings smaller 17-inch wheels and a better ride – but fewer features.
Interior ComfortThe Mazda6’s already-impressive interior has been improved for 2016. One of the biggest changes came where it was needed most: the infotainment system. Last year’s 5.8-inch touch-screen display has been replaced with a 7-inch model that rises from the center dash, and the rotary-dial master control in the center console now has an easy-to-reach volume control nearby. The new electronic parking brake frees up more space in the same area. On paper, the rear seat’s 38.7 inches of legroom looks good, but in reality, the overall space can feel tight. Up front, the sport seats are well-bolstered on the sides but less so in back. Larger drivers are advised to try before buying.
Exterior StylingMidsize sedans have recently taken on a trait usually not associated with traditional family haulers: style. The Mazda6 has been among the most successful of sedans transitioning from ho-hum to hot. This latest-gen Mazda has a pretty face and voluptuous curves. It adds up to a 4-door sedan that looks sporty, but not so over-the-top that it risks being outdated anytime soon. Among its standout elements are a long hood, rearward-set windshield and muscular haunches over the rear wheels. A retouched grille and new fog light surrounds in available ultra-bright LED headlights freshen the car for 2016.
Favorite FeaturesSKYACTIV-G ENGINEThe 2.5-liter Skyactiv 4-cylinder has an insanely high 13:1 compression ratio that helps it deliver maximum power and fuel economy without the need for turbocharging. The result is the best of both worlds: Snappy power delivery and highly commendable fuel economy.
I-ELOOP ENERGY CAPTUREDrivers wishing for the best fuel economy from their Mazda6 should consider the i-Eloop system that’s available on top-line Grand Touring models. This regenerative braking system employs a fast charging capacitor in place of a battery to capture and store electricity while the car is coasting.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Mazda6 is available in three trims: Sport, Touring, and Grand Touring. A base Sport model with a manual transmission comes with keyless entry and push-button start, cruise control, 60/40-split folding rear seats, and a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with auxiliary and USB inputs, plus Bluetooth streaming for phone and audio. This model’s base price is tempting, but we recommend spending the extra $1,500 and stepping up to the automatic transmission-equipped Sport model. That model adds the 7-inch touch-screen display, a backup camera, a multifunction command center, and HD Radio. If you want a better-equipped manual transmission Mazda6, one is available in Touring trim.
Factory OptionsMost major options for Mazda’s midsize sedan come by climbing trims. The well-equipped midline Touring model has leatherette seating in place of cloth, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, dual-zone climate control, a 6-way power driver’s seat and 19-inch wheels. That model can also be had with navigation, heated front seats, a moonroof and Bose audio. Top-line Grand Touring models get navigation, an 11-speaker Bose audio system, leather, an 8-way power driver’s seat with lumbar support, a power passenger seat, and paddle shifters. Other Grand Touring model options include the i-Eloop regenerative braking system, radar-based cruise control, lane-departure warning, and Smart Brake Support collision-mitigation system.
Engine & TransmissionThe sole powerplant for the 2016 Mazda6 is the 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G gasoline engine. It features a radical 13:1 compression ratio for greater efficiency. Equally innovative are the Skyactiv-MT 6-speed manual transmission and the Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic. The latter employs aspects of both torque-converter and dual-clutch transmissions to deliver both excellent low-speed feel and admirably quick shifts. The transmissions are lightweight and help the Mazda6 turn in laudable fuel economy of up to 38 mpg on the highway. Grand Touring models with the i-Eloop squeeze out more efficiency thanks to its regenerative braking system and active grille shutters for better aerodynamics. Those models are rated up to 40 mpg. As advanced as the engine is, it doesn’t require premium fuel.

The S E-Hybrid and diesel will burnish your green credentials, while the new Cayenne Turbo S and Cayenne GTS will blow your neighbors into the weeds.","ConsPart of the reason the Porsche Cayenne SUV remains exclusive is because of its price, high even by well-to-do standards. The Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 can coddle your family for half the price, or get an Audi Q7 or Mercedes-Benz GL-Class if you need an impressive badge.",995,"Driving the Used 2016 Porsche CayenneWe haven’t driven the new Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, but with a 0-60 time of 3.8 seconds, the word ""slow"" wasn’t anywhere near our impression of last year’s model. In fact, even the Cayenne S E-Hybrid is a bona fide blast to drive, zipping to 60 mph in only 5.4 seconds, but still returning an estimated 47 mpge in hybrid electric mode. The new Porsche Cayenne GTS, with its turbocharged V6 engine, splits the difference with a 0-60-mph time of about 4.4 seconds. However, keep in mind that there’s more to the Cayenne than outright speed. Cornering precision is beyond what you should rightfully expect from any SUV. The 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission fires off shifts in milliseconds, obviating the need for any manual option. Then there’s the Cayenne Diesel, with its copious torque and near 30 mpg on the highway, making it the most livable of the Cayenne family.
Interior ComfortPorsche’s interior design aesthetic is, simply put, beautiful. There’s sumptuous, finely stitched leather mixed with real wood and metal accents. It’s what you’ll find in newer 911s, as well as the Panamera sedan. Rear passengers aren’t forgotten, with a sliding and reclining seat and a pair of LCD screens in the front headrests. However, while the interior’s pretty, the numerous buttons, switches and knobs can be confusing, and not all of that confusion evaporates with familiarity, especially when it comes to using the navigation system. Regardless, there are few nicer interiors, and fewer still with this much cargo room.
Exterior StylingOne glance, and you immediately notice two things about the 2016 Porsche Cayenne. First is the abundance of muscular curves hinting at the Cayenne’s speed-and-performance mission. Second, those curves all blend into an unmistakably Porsche brand identity. A quick field guide to identifying Cayenne models focuses on the brakes: black calipers denote the Diesel model, silver the Cayenne S and Cayenne S E-Hybrid, and red the high-performance Turbo and GTS models. Turbo S models get the yellow ceramic brake option standard; it’s available elsewhere in the lineup. Turbo models get four exhaust pipes and a large trapezoidal grille.
Favorite FeaturesPORSCHE TORQUE VECTORING PLUSPart of the reason the Porsche Cayenne doesn’t feel like a ponderous SUV is the Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) system. By sending more power to the outside wheel when rounding turns, PTV Plus helps the Cayenne around corners, and helps you forget that you’re driving an SUV.
CERAMIC COMPOSITE BRAKESIf you plan on driving your Cayenne as hard as Porsche expects you to, then you’ll want the better stopping power, less fade and longer rotor life…not to mention the bright yellow brake hardware. Besides, what’s an extra $9,000 at this point, right?
Standard FeaturesYou can have your 2016 Porsche Cayenne in seven ways: There’s the base Cayenne, then the Diesel, S, S E-Hybrid, GTS, Turbo and Turbo S models. All Cayenne models come with all-wheel drive (AWD), water-repellent front side windows, a height-adjustable power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers and a 10-speaker audio system with a 7-inch touch screen. All Cayenne models come with a fuel-saving start/stop function that shuts off the engine at a stop and restarts it when the brake pedal is released. On the safety side, there are six airbags, a full suite of electronic stability aids, and roadside assistance while under warranty.
Factory OptionsThe Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control lets Porsche Cayenne owners take their SUV’s handling to the next level. It adjusts the anti-roll bars in real time to add stiffness to the suspension in response to conditions and whatever drive mode you have selected. A 1,000-watt, 16-speaker Burmester audio system is available for audiophiles, and in-vehicle connectivity includes an Aha Radio smartphone application, which offers a variety of customizable news, music and social networking services. Of course, there’s also that $9,000 brake system.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2016 Porsche Cayenne models come standard with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. However, there are seven distinct engines to choose from. The standard Cayenne comes with a 3.6-liter V6 engine offering 300 horsepower; we think it’s worth the extra money to make the stretch to the turbocharged versions, either the 420-horsepower Cayenne S or the 440-horsepower Cayenne GTS. The Cayenne Diesel offers a highly efficient, torque-rich turbocharged V6, while the Cayenne S E-Hybrid employs a 333-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6 coupled to a synchronous electric motor, which adds another 95 horsepower to the total. At the top of the line are the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S delivering a whopping 520 and 570 horsepower, respectively, from a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8.

The 2016 Porsche Cayenne leaves no doubt that anything wearing a Porsche badge lives up to the brand’s dominating performance capabilities. After introducing the eco-friendly Cayenne S E- Hybrid plug-in last year, Porsche introduces two new performance versions of the Cayenne. The new Cayenne Turbo S offers up 570 horsepower from its twin-turbo V8, giving it performance well beyond what you’d expect for a vehicle its size and weight. The new Porsche Cayenne GTS uses a new turbocharged V6 engine, but don’t worry, it too can keep up with the big boys. Add to the mix tons of luxury features and enviable curbside cachet, and the Porsche Cayenne is easily a match for competitors like the Land Rover Range Rover Sport, BMW X5 and Mercedes M-Class.

Driving the Used 2016 Nissan RogueWhile the 2016 Rogue compact-crossover SUV from Nissan may look racy and fast, its driving style is much more relaxed. The Rogue’s ride never feels jarring or jittery, even over rough pavement. Not that we are complaining, because while there are plenty of sporty SUVs from which to choose, those that emphasize a soft ride are becoming increasingly rare. Steering feel from the electric-assist power-steering system is actually quite good, and overall we found the Rogue’s ride to be controlled with noticeable lean only showing up during aggressive cornering. The 170-horsepower 2.5-liter engine isn’t exactly thrilling, but it does deliver adequate acceleration under most circumstances. When loaded with passengers, however, passing and merging can be tenuous maneuvers at best. Thanks mainly to the use of Nissan’s Xtronic CVT automatic transmission, the Rogue’s fuel economy is near best-in-class.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Rogue’s cabin is typically Nissan, with attractively illuminated instrumentation, quality materials, soft-touch surfaces and several infotainment and connectivity features. The NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” front seats – leather-clad in SL models – are supportive and comfortable. Front-seat legroom and headroom are good even for tall drivers, and rear-seat legroom has expanded over past models. Two-row Rogues can seat five passengers, while 3-row setups can seat seven. Nissan refers to the 3rd-row perch as “occasional seating,” but we’d lean toward ""never,"" at least for adults. It’s extremely tight. Storage space is ample and includes the slick cargo-system option mentioned above.
Exterior StylingNissan’s 2016 Rogue compact SUV has eye-catching styling with a youthful appeal. Bright colors pepper the paint palette, and there are a number of dealer-installed accessories, from external puddle lighting to a nifty 10×10 tent that can be attached to the Rogue’s open rear liftgate. The Rogue stands out with bright metal trim surrounding the side windows, a distinctive V-shaped grille carrying the floating Nissan badge, and even premium-look taillights. The Rogue’s aerodynamic styling helps contribute to better fuel economy. Overall, the Rogue’s good looks make it a worthy little brother to the larger and also-dapper Pathfinder 3-row midsize SUV.
Favorite FeaturesAROUND VIEW MONITORNissan’s brilliant 360-degree Around View Monitor uses cameras to simultaneously view all four exterior zones, helping the driver easily fit into tight parking spots, as well as avoid objects that might otherwise result in a collision.
DIVIDE ’N HIDE CARGO SYSTEMKeeping smaller objects (gym bag or groceries) in place is always a challenge. The 2016 Nissan Rogue answers this problem with an ingenious configurable cargo system capable of accommodating various-sized cargo. Although not available with the 3rd-row seat option, the system provides 18 possible variations including a fold-back passenger seat.
Standard FeaturesThe new Nissan Rogue is available in three trims: S, SV and SL. A base S version comes with a rearview monitor, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, text-message assistant and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with 5-inch color display and USB and auxiliary inputs. Mid-tier SV models come with NissanConnect mobile app service, dual-zone climate control, push-button ignition, 6-way-power driver’s seat, six speakers, rear privacy glass and roof rails. The top-line Rogue SL has the most features, including power liftgate, navigation system with 7-inch touch screen and voice control, the Around View monitor, leather-trimmed seats and 9-speaker Bose premium audio system.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive can be had on any 2016 Nissan Rogue in lieu of the standard front-drive, while 3-row/7-passenger seating is available for S and SV trims. Many of the Rogue’s other extras are bundled and vary by trim. The SV Premium package includes navigation, Siri Eyes Free, the Around View monitor, power liftgate, heated front seats, and safety features such as blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and moving-object detection. At just under $1,600, the SV Premium package makes the Rogue mid-trim model a real value. The SL Premium package includes panoramic moonroof, LED headlights and forward-collision warning and emergency braking.
Engine & TransmissionNissan’s 2016 Rogue compact SUV is powered by a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine matched to an Xtronic continuously variable transmission (CVT) that is well-suited for everyday driving, but as we mentioned in our Driving Impressions, is not as powerful as what’s found in many rivals. For those who need a vehicle that can tackle a variety of driving conditions and road surfaces, AWD is available and extracts only a minimal reduction in fuel economy vs. front-wheel-drive (FWD) models The Nissan Rogue’s tow rating is only 1,000 pounds. If that is important to you, know that a Jeep Cherokee is rated to tow up to 4,500 pounds.

The 2016 Nissan Rogue compact-crossover SUV is an intriguing prospect. Unlike the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, the Rogue offers a slightly different footprint with an available, albeit cramped, 3rd-row seat. A single engine choice isn’t the most powerful in this class, but the Rogue’s 2.5-liter 4-cylinder delivers an impressive 33 mpg. The Rogue’s true advantage lies in its smooth ride and upscale interior, plus its lengthy list of high-tech infotainment and safety features. Priced above a comparably equipped Hyundai Tucson but below the Ford Escape and GMC Terrain, the Rogue hits the sweet spot for most buyers. However, the Rogue lacks the fun-to-drive attitude found with the Mazda CX-5, Ford Escape and VW Tiguan.

The turbocharged Santa Fe Sport 2.0T starts at about the $32,000 mark for a FWD model. AWD adds $1,750 to either model. The Popular Equipment Package adds $1,350 to the 2.4-liter Santa Fe Sport, while the Premium package adds $3,300, and the Technology package adds another $3,500. The Ultimate Package for 2.0T models adds $4,350.

Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying, and note that the Santa Fe Sport’s residual values are a bit below the Toyota RAV4, but beat the Kia, Ford and Chevy.
Driving the Used 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe SportMost drivers don’t associate crossover SUVs with fun-to-drive characteristics, but the 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe might just change a few minds. Although the base 2.4-liter engine doesn’t provide much thrust, the 265 horsepower from the turbocharged 2.0-liter unit significantly increases both acceleration and passing abilities. The Santa Fe’s stiff structure allows Hyundai engineers to tune a suspension that is both capable in tight corners yet compliant over rough pavement. Equip Hyundai’s 2016 Santa Fe Sport SUV crossover with the available all-wheel-drive system, and you’ll get Active Cornering Control with torque vectoring and torque braking that improves traction and stability by sending power to the wheels with the best grip. Hyundai’s done an excellent job keeping exterior wind and road noise from reaching the cabin, another attribute that makes this compact family crossover SUV feel like a high-end luxury crossover SUV.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport crossover SUV proves that you don’t have to sacrifice user friendliness to have a contemporary interior design. All the controls inside are easy to reach and understand, and everything is constructed with care and high-quality materials. It’s also practical, with stain-resistant Yes Essentials fabric or available leather, and a rear bench seat that folds in a 40/20/40 split and is also available with 5.2 inches of fore-and-aft travel and a recline function as part of an option package. Behind the seats is a good-sized cargo space, making the Santa Fe Sport exceptionally flexible.
Exterior StylingHyundai gave its Santa Fe Sport compact crossover SUV a subtle 2-tone treatment to the grille, emphasizing the ""Sport"" part of the name, and the crossover SUV also gets daytime running lights as standard. Otherwise, the same exterior as last year carries over, and that’s fine with us. We like the sharply styled design, with impressive details merging with aerodynamic efficiency that include hidden underbody fairings. Standard equipment on the Sport are 17-inch alloy wheels with 235-65R17 tires, while the Sport 2.0T has 18-inch alloys with 235/60R18 tires as standard and 19-inch alloys with 235/55R19 tires optionally available.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED ENGINEMatched to a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic with manual shift mode, Hyundai’s 2016 Santa Fe Sport’s optional 2.0-liter turbo pumps out 265 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque for improved towing, passing and hauling. Fuel economy could be better, but it’s not horrible by any means.
HANDS-FREE SMART LIFTGATE WITH AUTO OPENWhile we think Hyundai could have come up with a better name, there’s no arguing this is one feature we don’t want to live without. Simply approach the rear of the vehicle with the key in your pocket and the hatch automatically opens.
Standard FeaturesStandard on every Hyundai Santa Fe Sport for 2016 are daytime running lights, a driver’s-side blind-spot mirror and auto up/down passenger window to the standard-equipment list. Also standard are air conditioning, cruise control, tilt/telescoping steering column, steering-wheel-mounted controls, remote keyless entry, an audio system that includes HD radio, USB and auxiliary inputs, Bluetooth and Blue Link. Turbocharged 2.0T models get a lot more equipment standard, including most of the base model’s Popular Equipment Package, adding roof rails, fog lights, heated mirrors, power driver’s seat, heated front seats, push-button start/stop and more. Safety features include stability and traction control, and plenty of airbags.
Factory OptionsThe base 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers the Popular Equipment Package mentioned above, plus a Premium Package that adds leather, blind-spot detection, dual-zone automatic temperature control and other features. The Tech Package includes a panoramic sunroof, rear park assist, navigation with 8-inch touch screen, Dimension premium audio, heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats with memory for driver’s seat and mirrors, heated rear seats and the Smart liftgate. The only package for Santa Fe Sport 2.0T models is an Ultimate Package, which adds 19-inch wheels and tires, HID xenon headlights, LED taillights, the power tailgate, Infinity sound system, and more.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2016 the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers a choice of two engines. Standard on the base Sport is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 190 horsepower; if that’s not enough, the 265-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the Sport 2.0T should satisfy you. Both engines benefit from modern direct fuel injection and continuously variable valve timing for the optimum in efficiency and power. The only transmission choice is a 6-speed automatic with a Shiftronic manual shift gate, for those who wish to shift for themselves, and is available in either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD), delivering responsive and impressive performance and fuel economy.

Driving the Used 2016 Toyota CamryWhen choosing a 2016 Toyota Camry, you first need to decide whether you prefer a softer, cushier ride quality or a stiffer, sportier driving experience. If the former, find yourself an LE or XLE. If the latter, you’ll be happier in an SE or XSE.
From there, you’ll need to determine whether affordability, speed or efficiency is most important to you. You’ll find great deals on Camrys with the standard 4-cylinder engine, because this engine was so popular when the car was new. The V6 engine, only available with XLE and XSE trims, supplies lively performance but comes at a premium. The Camry Hybrid returns effortlessly impressive gas mileage, and may also cost a bit more.
Each of these different variants has a unique driving character so if you’re not sure what’s going to work best for you, test-drive all combinations if possible.
How fast is the Toyota Camry? Get a Camry XLE V6 or XSE V6, and this midsize sedan is mighty quick, accelerating to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. You’ll rarely wish for more performance.
The standard 4-cylinder engine is adequate, especially if your expectations are low. The 6-speed automatic transmission is geared to mask this engine’s inherent lack of power, helping to satisfy drivers who aren’t requesting much in terms of acceleration.
The Camry Hybrid’s electric motor delivers a healthy punch of torque right off the line, making it feel responsive in traffic and urban driving situations despite its extra 245 pounds of curb weight. However, this powertrain uses an electronic continuously variable transmission (eCVT), and it drones under harder acceleration. That’s irritating.
Does the Toyota Camry get good gas mileage? In hybrid format, the Camry effortlessly delivers the gas mileage of a small city car in a midsize package. In combination with the large 17-gallon fuel tank, you’ll enjoy infrequent stops at the gas station.
The standard 4-cylinder engine’s fuel economy is unremarkable, and because this engine works harder in the real world than it does during the EPA testing cycle, it might ultimately disappoint. Expect it to consume more fuel than the official fuel-economy ratings suggest.
Because it has plenty of power, the V6 engine doesn’t need to work as hard as the 4-cylinder. While it still won’t match the standard 4-cylinder in terms of efficiency, the difference between the two is insubstantial enough that we recommend the upgrade to the V6. How does the Toyota Camry handle? If athletic handling is important to you, choose the Camry SE or XSE. These versions have larger wheels and tires than the LE and XLE, as well as a sport-tuned suspension. Toyota also added structural braces under the hood and in the trunk to help make the car stiffer and more responsive. The downside, of course, is a firmer and busier ride quality.
With the 4-cylinder engine, the Camry SE and XSE carry less weight over the front wheels, sharpening handling to a small degree. With the V6, you get more speed but at a cost of added weight over the front end.
Note that the Camry Hybrid SE does have the standard SE’s sport suspension, but does not have the extra structural bracing. Also, thanks to the added weight of the electric motor and battery pack, the Hybrid SE’s center of gravity is lower, helping to make it feel more hunkered down on the road. How does the Toyota Camry ride on the highway?If a comfortable and cushy ride is important to you, choose the Camry LE or XLE. With softer suspension tuning and without added structural bracing, these versions of the car do a better job of soaking up ruts and bumps. Plus, the LE and XLE have smaller wheels wearing all-season tires with thicker sidewalls, further helping in the ride quality department.
The downside, of course, is mushier handling and more body motion over uneven pavement. These versions of the Camry aren’t quite sloppy, but neither are they anywhere close to engaging. Drink coffee before driving them.
For the quietest Camry, you’ll want the XLE V6, which has an acoustic laminated windshield that helps to reduce wind noise. Are the Toyota Camry’s driving-assistance systems helpful? During testing of a Camry XSE V6 with the optional Technology Package, the elements of the car’s advanced driving-assistance systems (ADAS) that we could sample proved helpful with the exception of the lane-departure warning system. It quickly wears on your patience, beeping loudly and insistently with every line-crossing infraction. In turn, this prompts you to shut it off. Is the Toyota Camry fun to drive? If you get the Camry SE or XSE, the car is more fun to drive than the LE or XLE. And if you further upgrade to the XSE V6, the Camry is more enjoyable to rip around in than you’d ever expect. But does it encourage taking the long way home? Not really. Mainly, it’s just fast.
Interior ComfortEquipped with a layered dashboard design separated by a center control panel that sweeps down into the center console, the 2016 Camry blends form with function. By today’s standards, the touch-screen displays are small and lack sophistication, but otherwise the cabin remains modern in look and feel.
Does the Toyota Camry have a nice interior? For 2015, Toyota upgraded the Camry’s interior materials, and those improvements are evident in the 2016 version. However, like many of its competitors, the lower portions of the cabin are covered with inexpensive plastic panels that have a glossy finish and are easily scuffed and scratched.
The Camry LE is the worst offender. Moving up the trim-level ladder, the car adds nicer trim accents, exposed seat and steering-wheel stitching, and higher-quality seat upholstery. The SE Special Edition is especially appealing, but only if you really like the color blue.
What Toyota Camry interior colors are available? For the greatest variety of interior colors, look no further than a Camry LE or XLE. These trim levels offered Black, Ash (gray) or Almond (beige) cabins dressed in fabric or leather upholstery.
The SE and XSE trims restrict buyers to Black or Ash. Neither includes full leather seats. The SE trim has sport fabric inserts and synthetic leather bolsters, while the XSE includes simulated-suede inserts and leather bolsters.
As part of what makes it special, the SE Special Edition came only in Black with blue seat inserts.
Are the Toyota Camry’s controls easy to use? Featuring large knobs and buttons with clear and legible markings, the Camry’s primary controls are exceptionally easy to use. Big gauges and logical locations for secondary switchgear make the car easy to understand and drive.
Is the Toyota Camry’s infotainment system easy to use? Small screen sizes and frequent glare can make the Camry’s infotainment system harder to use than those in some competing models. It doesn’t help that the technology sometimes lags, and that the virtual buttons require a distracting amount of precision to accurately activate while you’re driving — especially on less than perfectly smooth pavement.
We recommend getting all of the system’s functions set to your preferences, and then using the hard controls on the dashboard and steering wheel as often as possible. By the standards of the time, the voice-command system works reasonably well, too. Just don’t expect natural recognition along the lines of modern smartphones and digital home assistants.
Is the Toyota Camry comfortable? The 2016 Camry is quite comfortable for drivers. The power adjustable driver’s seat and the tilt/telescopic steering wheel make it easy to find the right position behind the steering wheel, and the padding on the center console armrest and door panels is elbow-friendly.
Toyota did not offer a height-adjustable front-passenger’s seat for any version of the 2016 Camry. Normally, this counts as a demerit against any vehicle, but the seat is mounted high enough off the floor to provide decent thigh support and a good view out. Still, height adjustment is important so that older passengers have an easier time with vehicle entry and exit.
In back, the Camry’s rear seat is roomy enough for adults to ride without compromise.
Is the Toyota Camry’s trunk useful? Equipped with a 15.4-cubic-foot trunk, the Camry’s cargo hold is typical of a midsize family sedan. Split-folding rear seats are standard, adding utility to the car.
One downside to choosing the Camry Hybrid is the car’s smaller trunk. The battery pack takes up some of the space, so maximum volume measures 13.1 cubic feet. That’s on par with a typical compact sedan, though, so the space is still useful.
What else should I know about the Toyota Camry? Toyota was not shy about selling Camrys to rental-car companies, business fleets and other entities. If you prefer to avoid used examples that started life in these environments, perform a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) check to get a sense of a specific car’s history.
Exterior StylingFor the 2015 model year, Toyota re-skinned the Camry, which had been previously redesigned for 2012. Every body panel except for the roof and greenhouse went under the stylist’s knife, resulting in a sleeker and softer appearance. In spite of this effort, however, the Camry still isn’t what you might characterize as appealing.
Adoption of Toyota’s gape-mounted grille designs and an awkward rear roof-pillar trim treatment come across as visual tricks rather than genuinely cohesive design. Especially in comparison to more stylish competitors such as the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima, Mazda Mazda6 and Volkswagen Passat, the 2016 Camry relied on its reputation for reliability more than its appearance in order to sell.
At a minimum, you’ll want to upgrade to SE or XLE trim for their larger and more appealing aluminum wheels. Between the two, we find the SE/XSE mesh grille insert more attractive than the horizontal slats of the LE/XLE. Plus, the sportier Camrys have a tasteful lip spoiler for extra character.
What 2016 Toyota Camry colors are available? Toyota offered 10 paint colors for the 2016 Camry. They are listed below:
Super WhiteCelestial SilverCosmic GrayPredawn GrayMidnight BlackCrème BruleeParisian NightBlue CrushBlue Streak (Special Edition only)Blizzard Pearl (Special Edition only)
Favorite FeaturesV6 ENGINEAvailable as an option with XLE and XSE trims, Toyota’s 3.5-liter V6 engine provides plenty of refined power. It makes 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, but feels much stronger than that from behind the steering wheel. Acceleration is effortless, and in our testing this engine averaged 22.9 mpg in spite of heavy feet on the go pedal.
HYBRID POWERTRAINGoing fast is fun, but so is skipping past gas stations. With EPA fuel-economy ratings of up to 40 mpg in combined driving and a 17-gallon gas tank, a Camry Hybrid can travel 680 miles or more between fill-ups. And with 200 horsepower on tap, it has no trouble keeping up in traffic.
SCOUT GPS-CONNECTED NAVIGATION APPIn the absence of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, the 2016 Camry’s mid-level Entune Audio Plus infotainment system came with Scout GPS-connected navigation. Basically, you pay for the app, download it to your phone, connect the phone via the USB port, and it runs on your data plan.
SAFETY CONNECT SERVICEOffered exclusively in the Camry XLE, Safety Connect is a subscription-based service that provides automatic collision notification, SOS emergency calling, and other safety- and security-related functions. While it is a favorite feature of ours, Toyota deserves criticism for limiting this potentially life-saving feature to the XLE trim.
WIRELESS SMARTPHONE CHARGINGAvailable for all but the Camry LE, Toyota’s Qi-compatible wireless smartphone charging pad makes it easy keep your device charged up while you’re commuting and road-tripping.
Standard FeaturesToyota sold the 2016 Camry in LE, SE, SE Special Edition, XLE, XLE V6, XSE and XSE V6 trim levels. The 2016 Camry Hybrid came in LE, SE and XLE trims. Below, we define the major differences between each version of the car.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Camry LE? Think of the Camry LE as the version that gives you everything you really need, and nothing you don’t.
It looks basic, inside and out, but does come with power heated side mirrors, power windows, power door locks, and an 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. Add cloth seats, air conditioning, cruise control and a 6.1-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Bluetooth and Siri Eyes Free, and you might not want more.
But get more you will if you choose the Camry Hybrid LE. It includes Toyota’s Optitron instrumentation and lighting, a passive keyless-entry system, push-button engine starting, and dual-zone automatic climate control. But it still has a basic look and feel.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Camry XLE? For a more upscale vibe, get the Camry XLE. It has leather seats, fake-wood trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, and rear air-conditioning vents. A bigger 7-inch infotainment system upgrades the infotainment system, which includes satellite radio, HD Radio and a Scout GPS-connected navigation app that uses your smartphone’s data plan to provide directions.
The XLE also gets a snazzier look on the outside. Bigger 17-inch aluminum wheels with a shiny finish are standard, along with LED running lights. If you get a Camry XLE V6, it has LED headlights, a power sunroof and dual-exhaust outlets.
Inside, the XLE V6 receives another infotainment-system upgrade, adding an embedded navigation system and Toyota’s Entune App Suite technology. Acoustic windshield glass makes the cabin a little quieter, and the XLE V6 has additional convenience features including an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a programmable garage-door opener.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Camry SE? If you prefer a sporty look and feel, choose the Camry SE instead of the Camry LE. It’s outfitted like the LE but adds 17-inch aluminum wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, and front and rear structural bracing.
Unique interior trim and Optitron instrumentation inject a little excitement, along with seat upholstery blending sport cloth inserts with simulated-leather bolsters. A leather-wrapped steering wheel includes transmission paddle shifters.
The Camry Hybrid SE is just like it, but without the paddle shifters, front-strut tower brace, and rear trunk brace.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Camry SE Special Edition? You’ll find the SE Special Edition only in exclusive Blizzard Pearl or Blue Streak paint with a unique set of 18-inch aluminum wheels. Inside, the SE Special Edition has blue instrumentation lighting, blue seat inserts and blue interior trim. Upgraded floor mats and Special Edition identifiers complete the look.
From the more expensive XSE trim, the SE Special Edition features an upgraded infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen, satellite radio, HD Radio, and a Scout GPS-connected navigation app. Additionally, the SE Special Edition has a handful of items from the XSE V6 model, including a power sunroof, passive keyless entry and push-button engine starting.
Toyota made 12,000 examples of the 2016 Camry SE Special Edition. What comes in the 2016 Toyota Camry XSE? The sportiest version of the Camry, the XSE trim wears 18-inch aluminum wheels with performance-oriented tires. Inside, sport seats with bigger leather bolsters and simulated Ultrasuede inserts give the Camry XSE a more purposeful look and feel.
Equipment includes dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, and rear air-conditioning vents so that rear passengers can better keep their cool. The upgraded infotainment system equips the Camry XSE with a 7-inch touch-screen display, satellite radio, HD Radio and a Scout GPS-connected navigation app.
With the available V6 engine, the XSE swaps the connected navigation system for an embedded navigation system. Toyota’s Entune App Suite technology also comes along for the ride, and the XSE V6 features passive keyless entry, push-button engine starting, a power sunroof, and cabin-quieting acoustic windshield glass. Dual exhaust outlets, LED headlights, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a programmable garage-door opener complete the XSE V6’s roster of equipment.
Factory OptionsMore affordable versions of the 2016 Camry could be optioned with selected equipment from higher trim levels.
The list for the base Camry LE was a short one, including an infotainment system upgrade to a 7-inch touch-screen display, satellite radio, HD Radio, and Scout GPS-connected navigation.
This same infotainment system was offered for the Camry SE, along with a separate step up to the top-shelf system with an embedded navigation system and Entune App Suite. Original owners of the SE could also opt for a wireless-device charger and a power sunroof.
Wireless charging and a power sunroof were available for XLE and XSE trims, too. Additionally, these versions of the Camry could be fitted with a JBL premium sound system, Safety Connect subscription services, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. A Technology Package installed adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and automatic high-beam headlights.
Toyota dealerships also sold a variety of retailer-installed accessories for the 2016 Camry, some more useful than others.
Engine & TransmissionToyota offered three different powertrains for the 2016 Camry, and every version of car came with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive was not available.
The majority of 2016 Camrys have a tried-and-true 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine. It produces 178 horsepower and is teamed with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Simple, reliable, and reasonably powerful and efficient, this powertrain combination will satisfy most Camry owners most of the time.
2.5-liter 4-cylinder178 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm170 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpmFuel tank size: 17 gal.EPA fuel economy (city/highway/combined): 25/34/28 mpgDriving range (city/highway/combined): 425/578/476 miles
If strong acceleration is important to you, either because you like to drive or you simply want to make sure you have enough power to safely merge onto freeways or make turns across traffic, then you’ll want to consider the XLE or XSE trim with the V6 engine.
A 3.5-liter V6, it feels stronger than its 268-horsepower rating might suggest. Smooth, refined and capable of accelerating a Camry with remarkable speed, the V6 engine also uses a 6-speed automatic transmission.
3.5-liter V6268 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm248 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpmFuel tank size: 17 gal.EPA fuel economy (city/highway/combined): 21/30/25 mpgDriving range (city/highway/combined): 357/510/425 miles Making more total horsepower than the standard 4-cylinder engine, and returning much better fuel economy, the Camry Hybrid is definitely worth consideration.
It combines a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with a 105-kW electric motor and a 244.8-volt nickel-metal hydride battery to produce 200 horsepower while getting up to 40 mpg. The only bummer is the electronic continuously variable transmission (eCVT), which tends to drone loudly during acceleration.
This is a dependable powertrain, and it’s worth noting that Camry Hybrids endure significant abuse as New York City taxicabs.
Gas-electric Hybrid2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline enginePermanent magnet AC synchronous electric motorNickel-metal hydride batteryCombined power rating: 200 horsepowerFuel tank size: 17 gal.EPA fuel economy (city/highway/combined): 40/37/39 mpg (SE, XLE)Driving range (city/highway/combined): 680/629/663 miles

A new Special Edition arrives with exclusive paint, unique wheels, an upgraded interior & extra standard equipment

A midsize car boasting a long-standing reputation for reliability, the 2016 Camry isn’t the most exciting vehicle in its class, but that’s partly due to its utter ubiquity.
The best-selling car in America for many years, the Camry is commonplace, and a bit boring. But the car’s popularity also means there are plenty of them on the used-car market. And that translates into greater selection for a used-car buyer.
Better yet, Toyota refreshed the Camry for 2015, and did not redesign the car until 2018. Therefore, you can cross-shop a 2016 Camry with both the 2015 and 2017 models, further expanding the possibility that you’ll find the right car for you. As a result, you should have no problem finding one that’s in good condition and equipped just the way you want it — unless you’re seeking the limited-production SE Special Edition.
When shopping for a used Toyota Camry, you’ll find the 4-cylinder model in LE, SE, SE Special Edition, XLE and XSE trim levels. A V6 engine was offered only with XLE and XSE trims. Hybrids came in LE, SE and XLE trim levels.
In the midsize-sedan category, there are several alternatives to the Camry. They include the KBB Best Buy winner of that model year, the 2016 Kia Optima, as well as finalists like the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu, 2016 Honda Accord, 2016 Hyundai Sonata and 2016 Mazda Mazda6.

The ST and RS offer a level of power and performance previously unknown in a domestic compact. The Focus electric can take you 75 miles while emitting zero emissions.","ConsAs good as it is, Ford’s 2016 Focus can’t match the low price and content of the Kia Forte, Nissan Sentra or Chevy Cruze. The only all-wheel-drive model starts around $36,000 and if you’re seeking a coupe or wagon, you’ll have to look elsewhere.",36000,"What's New?The 2016 Ford Focus adds the option of a 6-speed automatic transmission to the 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine. Ford’s Sync 3 is a vast improvement over the previous system, with better voice control and a more intuitive interface.
In the competitive field of compact cars, Ford’s 2016 Focus sedan and hatchback remain remarkably competitive, offering a wide assortment of trims, powertrains and price ranges. With fresh styling, a tech-rich interior and a reasonable price tag, the Focus has all it needs to challenge cars like the Dodge Dart, Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and Honda Civic. From the fuel-efficient 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine in the SE, to the tire-scorching power of the all-wheel-drive RS, the Focus is able to stare down just about every competitor. Then again, the Focus has no answer to the sporty Honda Civic and Kia Forte coupes, nor the affordable all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza wagon.
Used 2016 Ford Focus PricingA base Focus S sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $18,000. Hatchback variants are slightly more. The performance-oriented Ford Focus ST hatchback starts just over $25,500. The all-electric Focus EV hatchback starts right around $30,000, while the new RS pushes the price to just under $36,600. Unlike some electric cars, the Focus EV is available in all 50 states, and incentives can potentially be worth thousands of dollars. Prices on most Focus models are in line with those of rivals such as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla sedans, but remain more expensive than base versions of the Kia Forte and Mazda3. Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Focus. The Focus’ resale value has traditionally been fair, but below leaders such as the Subaru Impreza and Honda Civic.
Driving the Used 2016 Ford FocusAs Ford’s “world car,” the compact 2016 Focus is sold in multiple countries, meaning its driving characteristic and styling must undergo more scrutiny than the average domestic. What else can explain this simple compact’s excellent driving characteristics, ergonomically pleasing interior layout and wide range of models and engines? We think most Americans will like the ride delivered by the SE trim, which can be nicely loaded up and still remain well below $25,000. The Titanium brings even more bells and whistles, but its larger tires and sport suspension create a rather firm ride. The 252-horsepower ST is Ford’s VW GTI-killer, and it’s quite an impressive piece of work, although when equipped with the optional Recaro seats, anyone with more than a 30-inch waist may find themselves wedged in place. Stopping power is a strong point across the line, even with the base model’s rear-drum setup.
Interior ComfortFord’s 2016 Focus compact comes with a host of interior upgrades to enhance usability. For example, there’s a small cubby and USB port ahead of the shifter, perfect for your phone. The climate controls and steering-wheel buttons are easy to use, and the blue backlighting is both stylish and easy on the eyes. Optional features like a heated steering wheel help the Focus stand out in this segment, and ample sound deadening helps make the Focus one of the quietest cars in its class. Unfortunately, the Focus’ rear-seat head- and legroom are now surpassed by a number of newer competitors.
Exterior StylingThe 2016 Focus compact looks a bit like a miniature version of the Fusion sedan. Adopting Ford’s Aston Martin-like grille in last year’s update, the Focus remains fresh despite its age. The sleek aerodynamic look, raked windshield and tastefully flared fenders give the Focus a substantial look that belies its price. Both the sedan and hatchback can be outfitted with wheel-and-tire packages ranging from 15-inch steel wheels on the Focus S to 215/55 tires with 17-inch aluminum rims on Titanium models; Titanium models also offer an 18-inch wheel package with a sport-tuned suspension.
Favorite FeaturesHEAD-TURNING STYLEWhere some small cars limit the extent of their styling to the grille and taillights, the Focus stands out at any angle. From its handsome wheel options and exterior add-ons to its impressive interior package offerings, the 2016 Ford Focus leads the segment in personalization choices.
GREAT DRIVING EXPERIENCEFrom an enthusiast’s point of view, the Ford Focus compact for 2016 delivers one of the most enjoyable driving experiences one can have in a compact car. Even the base models have the ability to instill a sense of confidence in the most novice driver.
Standard FeaturesAll 2016 Ford Focus models come standard with MyKey, a feature that allows owners to limit maximum speed and other settings for young drivers. Other standard features for the Focus S include air conditioning, a tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless remote entry and an AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio. SE models get standard Sync with MyFord Driver Connect, cruise control, a folding rear seat, rearview camera and 16-inch tires on alloy wheels. Titanium models add leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, 10-speaker Sony audio, push-button starting, and Sync 3 with MyFord Touch; Focus Electric models get eco-fabric seat covers and voice-activated navigation.
Factory OptionsFord’s new Focus benefits from several option packages. SE models can be equipped with the Sport Package, which adds exterior styling enhancements, paddle shifters for the automatic transmission, revised suspension settings and 17-inch wheels. Also available are a blind-spot-warning system and lane-keeping system. Focus buyers can also order the economical 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine for maximum fuel economy. Additionally, Ford’s Sync AppLink is available, allowing Focus drivers to interact with more than 60 AppLink-enabled apps on their phones through the car’s Sync technology. Active Park Assist, handling and winter packages, and navigation are also available.

You’ll get the authentic Porsche driving experience you demand, with virtually no sacrifice because of the additional doors.","ConsThere are a lot of high-performance, high-powered sedans out there, ranging from the Audi S8 to the Jaguar XJR and BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe. Most offer more rear-seat room – the Panamera seats only four – and many offer better reliability and resale track records.",995,"Driving the Used 2016 Porsche PanameraWhile it is literally true that the 2016 Panamera is the Porsche of sedans, it’s also an apt metaphor for the driving experience. Whether it’s the 310-horsepower base model or the 570-horsepower Turbo S, every Panamera model offers a unique blend of handling and performance that is not just incredible for a nearly 2-ton sedan, but could only have come from Porsche. The way this big sedan takes corners, accelerates, and delivers precise feedback to the driver is beyond reproach among other sedans. The sophisticated suspension damping and steering setup dispatch road imperfections and irregularities that would jostle and bounce lesser sedans. The only model where our praise is tempered somewhat is the S E-Hybrid, which doesn’t have quite the positive steering and brake feel as the rest of the Panamera lineup. That said, when you lay on the Hybrid’s throttle, hold on, because this car is seriously quick.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Porsche Panamera sits sports-car low to the ground, so getting in and out of the excellent seats can be a bit trying. But once in, you’ll love it. The interior is classy and high-tech, with impeccable fit and finish. There’s plenty of room in front for even very tall drivers, although the rear seat isn’t so accommodating unless you’re talking about the long-wheelbase models, which at least offer good legroom. The excellent audio system is just the start of the many high-tech features, but it’d be nice if there were fewer buttons on the steering wheel, console and dash.
Exterior StylingFrom the wide stance, to the curved humpback shape, to the frog-like nose, the 2016 Panamera sheet metal is awash in an unmistakable ""Porscheness."" It’s not just that it looks like an elongated 911 coupe, but the whole of the car conveys the notion of a connection to a history and reputation earned and refined on the racetrack. Styling tweaks a couple years ago tightened the body’s lines, made LED headlights available – standard on Turbo S – and added an expanded rear trunklid with a wider glass window and an electrically deploying spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesEXTERIOR STYLINGNobody drops six figures on a car to blend in, and there’s nothing on the road that looks quite like the 2016 Porsche Panamera. This is a car that will get you noticed wherever you go, and from any angle, it’s unmistakably a Porsche.
S E-HYBRID PLUG-IN HYBRIDNobody but Porsche could so convincingly prove that hybrids can be legitimately sporty machines. With the 2016 Panamera S E-Hybrid, it goes even further, offering up to 22 miles of electric range at speeds up to 85 mph, while delivering a driving experience no other plug-in can match.
Standard FeaturesAs expected of a premium luxury car, the 2016 Porsche Panamera comes very nicely equipped, even in its base model. There’s a slide/tilt moonroof, plus hard-drive-based navigation and an automatic liftgate. The audio system includes Bluetooth, both front seats are power-adjustable eight ways, and there are additional luxury, convenience and safety features. On the performance side, there are electronically controlled shock absorbers and Porsche Stability Management, and long-wheelbase executive models feature Adaptive air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management to improve both ride and handling.
Factory OptionsBeyond options such as higher-end audio systems – your choice of Bose or Burmester – a rear-seat entertainment system with 7-inch screens, there is a host of bespoke options you can order with your 2016 Panamera; if you like a particular color, provide a swatch and your Panamera will be draped in the same. Of course, there are high-tech safety options as well, such as Lane Change Assist, adaptive cruise control, LED headlights, thermally- and noise-insulated glass, and 4-zone automatic climate control with separate air-temperature, blower-intensity and air-distribution adjustments for each seat.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine for the 2016 Panamera – both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) Panamera 4 models – is a 310-horsepower 3.6-liter all-aluminum V6. Move up to the S models and you’ll get a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 good for 420 horsepower. The rest of the lineup, except for the S E-Hybrid, get some form of a 4.8-liter all-aluminum V8, which varies in power from 440 horsepower in the Panamera GTS to 570 horsepower in the Turbo S Executive GT. The transmission for these models is a 7-speed Porsche PDK automatic transmission with manual control. The exception to all this is the Panamera S E-Hybrid, which combines a 3.0-liter V6 and electric motor for 416 horsepower, routed through an 8-speed Tiptronic S automatic.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2016 Porsche Panamera charges into the new year virtually unchanged. There’s a new charging dock holder for the E Hybrid model, and a new rear-seat entertainment system is available.
While some manufacturers call their sedans “4-door sports cars,” only the 2016 Porsche Panamera can say it with a straight face. As the polarizing effect of the Porsche Panamera’s design has softened over the years, let us focus on what a fantastic driving car the Panamera is. Its looks are stunning, and it’s available with everything from a V6 or a plug-in hybrid to a ground-pounding twin-turbo V8 with 570 horsepower. Yet it does all this while surrounding its driver and passengers in sublime comfort and luxury. Sure, a Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG offers more rear legroom, and the BMW 640i Gran Coupe costs less, but neither can match the Panamera’s distinctive shape and incomparable driving experience.

With a super fuel-efficient hybrid, plus tons of cool features, it’s worth a look.","ConsSome are hesitant to jump in with both feet on an all-new model from any manufacturer, especially one with so much new technology, including two new powertrains. For them, something that’s been on sale for a while might be a more comfortable choice.",22500,"Driving the Used 2016 Chevrolet MalibuOur fully loaded 2016 Malibu Premier immediately impressed when pulling away from the first stoplight we encountered. With the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, the Malibu pulled strongly, its new 8-speed automatic clicking off shifts with immediacy and precision, but without any harshness. You can manually select gears with a rocker switch on top of the gear selector; we’d prefer paddles on the steering wheel, but for the few times you’re likely to manually shift it worked well enough. The suspension was also very nicely sorted. Despite the big 19-inch wheels on our test car, and the corresponding low-profile tires, the new Malibu rode smoothly over pretty much any surface we encountered. Additionally, it held its own in corners, although it’s clear that Chevy has conceded the handling crown to the likes of the Mazda6 (along with everyone else).
Interior ComfortChevy strikes a winning balance of integrating controls into its touch-screen system without forcing users to be over-reliant on it. The fact that Chevy’s MyLink uses big, bright icons that are easy to tap is part of the appeal, and we aren’t just talking about CarPlay. Beyond functionality, the interior looks great. There are big clear gauges, a good-looking swoop and curve to the dash, and it’s easy to see out, too. The front seats are comfortable and highly adjustable, and the rear seats finally have enough legroom to seat adults, although headroom is still a little tight.
Exterior StylingThe 2016 Malibu is clearly inspired by its big brother, the Chevy Impala. In fact, this is an even better interpretation of that design aesthetic, with lines that flow when it’s needed, but tight when they should be. For example, the subtly sculpted coves in the front and rear doors look elegant, while the taillights tie it together, with LEDs in Premier models. LED daytime running lights augment the headlights in higher-end models as well, and super-bright HID headlights are also available. Wheel sizes range from 16 inches all the way up to the 19-inchers on our test car.
Favorite FeaturesAPPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTOWe’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are our two new favorite things. After all, who wouldn’t want the identical functionality of their smartphone reflected on their car’s infotainment system?
TEEN DRIVERFor nervous parents with first-time drivers, Teen Driver is about as close as you can get to keeping close track of your kids without an actual helicopter. It lets you monitor where the car has been, how fast it’s been driven, and even mutes the audio unless everyone’s strapped in.
Standard FeaturesThe base Malibu L model is a rental-fleet special that comes with only the basics: air conditioning, cruise control and an AM/FM radio. In reality, the 2016 Chevy Malibu lineup starts at the LS model, which includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with USB ports and Bluetooth with its 7-inch MyLink infotainment system. Also standard are a rearview camera and the 6-way-adjustable manual driver’s seat. Also standard is the new 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with stop-start and hill-start assist. On the safety front, there are 10 total airbags, plus stability control and OnStar, which automatically dials for help in an accident.
Factory OptionsBeyond choices such as the new Malibu Hybrid and 2LT and Premier and their bespoke drivetrains, the 2016 Malibu brings a lot of tech to the midsize-sedan party, including available adaptive cruise control, blind-spot warning, forward-collision alert and rear cross-traffic alert. A 4G LTE-powered Wi-Fi hotspot can help you find your dinner spot, the available on-board navigation system can help you get there, and the Automatic Parking Assist can even help you park when you arrive. And of course there are available leather upholstery and automatic climate control, although the latter only on Premier models.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine for 2016 Malibu models from L through LT1 is the 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic. It’s a frugal choice, but its 160 horsepower shouldn’t have any trouble moving the new Malibu, which is 300 pounds lighter than last year’s model. LT2 and Premier models get the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which we know gets the new Malibu moving without hesitation. Thanks to the new 8-speed automatic transmission, it’s still as fuel-efficient as its competitors’ upgrade engines. Then there’s the new hybrid, which uses a combination of a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder and two electric motors working in tandem for a combined 182 horsepower. All the engines run on regular gasoline; premium is recommended for the 2.0-liter but not required.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu is an all-new vehicle, and owes virtually nothing but its name and its top-end turbocharged 4-cylinder engine to last year’s model.
The all-new 2016 Chevrolet Malibu hits the reset button not just on Chevy’s midsize sedan, but maybe on our expectations of all Chevrolet sedans. Its sleek looks might be the best in its class, resembling the larger Chevy Impala in all the right ways. But there’s more than that pretty face. The new Chevy Malibu boasts a comfortable and modern interior with a big back seat and high-tech features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, rear cross-traffic alert and automatic-parking assist. There are three engine choices, including an all-new 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and a hybrid with a Volt-derived powertrain. Put it together, and it’s a formidable contender against the likes of the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima.

Another big draw is Hyundai’s excellent powertrain warranty that’s good for 10 years/100,000 miles.
ConsThough its interior space has grown, the revamped Tucson’s cargo capacity still trails that of the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Also, it isn’t as quick as a turbocharged Kia Sportage or as nimble as a Mazda CX-5.",24000,"Used 2016 Hyundai Tucson PricingThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $23,595 for a base SE. The more efficient Eco model begins just over $25,000, while the well-equipped Tucson Sport trim starts just over $27,000. A top-line Limited edition bows at $30,795. Adding all-wheel drive to any model is an additional $1,400. Go full boat on a Limited Ultimate and you can reach the mid-$30,000 mark. At these prices, the new Tucson starts just below the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV and Nissan Rogue, and is nearly identical to the Ford Escape. The Hyundai Tucson’s cousin, the Kia Sportage, begins a few hundred below the Tucson. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Tucson. Because this model is all-new, we have yet to predict the Tucson’s residual value. In general, though, Hyundai’s star has lifted in recent years.
Driving the Used 2016 Hyundai TucsonThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson has made great gains in terms of overall comfort. Most appreciated are its well-insulated cabin that keeps outside sounds at bay, a new suspension setup that yields a more composed ride even on gravel, and steering that feels less artificial than past models. The 1.6-liter turbocharged model we tested had adequate power for most duties, but we would have requested a few more ponies under the hood for passing situations. A new drive mode selector that includes a Sport setting does help when you need more verve, however, as it makes the Hyundai’s throttle, engine and shifting more responsive. Regarding the latter, the 1.6-liter Tucson is the only SUV in its class to use a 7-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission. The new setup grants smooth shifts, is eager to kick down when needed, and helps attain fuel economy of up to 33 mpg in Eco trim.
Interior ComfortThe Tucson’s 2-row, 5-passenger interior has improved in both size and sophistication. While base SE models make do with a 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, even climbing one trim brings the more comfortable 8-way power-adjust version with lumbar support. We applaud the use of buttons and knobs for climate and audio functions even in higher-spec models to complement the touch screen. Also noteworthy are the Tucson’s near flat-folding rear seats and dual-level cargo floor. A particularly thoughtful feature is the ability to store the cargo tonneau cover underneath the floor. The optional panoramic sunroof is huge, but rear-side visibility is hampered by small, narrow windows.
Exterior StylingThe 2016 Tucson’s new suit will likely be one of the first things you notice – and among the biggest initial draws to Hyundai’s compact SUV. Treated to the automaker’s latest ""Fluidic Sculpture 2.0"" design, the Tucson now looks like the rightful little brother to the Hyundai Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport. The new Tucson has a sporty, forward stance, sharp creases below the side windows, and Hyundai’s large trapezoidal grille. Just as impressive is what you cannot see: The Tucson’s new chassis now uses more than 50 percent high-strength steel, vs. 18 percent for the former model.
Favorite FeaturesSMART POWER TAILGATEWhile competitors offer motion-activated power tailgates that lift with, say, a kick of the foot, Hyundai uses proximity to sense your intentions. Stand for a few seconds near the tailgate with the key in pocket or purse, and the Tucson will automatically raise the rear door while you leave both feet on the ground.
YES ESSENTIALS STAIN PROTECTIONThe interior of a small SUV can be a busy, potentially stain-inducing place. That’s why Hyundai Tucson models with cloth seats come with YES Essentials fabric technology. In addition to fighting stains, the seat fabric helps repel foul odors and even reduces static electricity.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Tucson is available in four main trims: SE (base), Eco, Sport and Limited. If you go with the least-expensive model, you’ll still get an automatic transmission (an added cost in some rivals), backup camera, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and a 5-inch touch screen AM/FM/CD 6-speaker audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, and USB and auxiliary inputs. Stepping up to the Eco model brings the more efficient yet more powerful 1.6-liter turbo engine, roof rails and LED daytime running lights, while the Sport model adds blind-spot monitoring, heated front seats, push-button start, and a power liftgate with the proximity open feature.
Factory OptionsAt the top end of the Tucson food chain is the Limited trim that comes with leather seating, LED headlights and taillights, a chrome grille and door handles, a power passenger seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. That model also gets an upgraded infotainment system with 8-inch touch-screen command module, 405-watt/8-speaker audio system, and Hyundai’s Blue Link 2.0 smartphone interface. If this still isn’t enough, there’s the Ultimate Package that includes ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, lane-departure warning, a panoramic sunroof, rear parking sensors, and automatic emergency braking system with pedestrian detection.
Engine & TransmissionTwo drivetrains are available in the 2016 Hyundai Tucson. The base SE model uses the carryover 2.0-liter naturally aspirated (non-turbocharged) 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission, while the rest come with the fresh 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available with either engine in lieu of the standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) setup. The AWD Tucson has a ""lock"" feature that grants up to a 50/50 torque split between the front and rear wheels for better traction in slippery or off-road conditions. While you may equate turbocharging with speed, the application here is more for fuel economy, which allows the Tucson’s smaller engine to be rated up to 33 mpg, a 5-mpg gain over the past 2.4-liter engine. In other welcome news, this turbo engine does just fine running on regular gasoline.

Slightly larger than its predecessor, it has fresh sheet metal that is both stronger and more stylish, a larger interior, and loads of new tech and safety features. A 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder replaces the larger and less-efficient 2.4-liter 4-cylinder.
The Hyundai Tucson enters its third generation for 2016 as an all-new compact crossover SUV. Long a competent but rather uninspiring competitor to best-sellers like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape, the 2016 Tucson has reinvented itself to pose a credible challenge to such stalwarts. Along with an eye-catching exterior design, this 5-passenger SUV now boasts some of the latest technology and safety aids available, such as automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection.

If all you need is a truck to haul personal items, a more manageable midsize, like the GMC Canyon or Toyota Tacoma, makes a better choice.",28500,"Driving the Used 2016 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabGMC’s full-size 2016 Sierra pickup seems almost at odds with itself. On the one hand, the Sierra is a rugged and capable full-size truck. On the other, it’s a luxurious ride so nice you may not want to get it dirty, let alone take it to the work site. The 5.3-liter V8 is probably the best engine for this type of truck, being both powerful and somewhat economical. At highway speeds, we found the Sierra’s cabin remarkably quiet and comfortable, while the truck’s suspension easily absorbed minor road distortions. We did find that over larger bumps and washboard surfaces, the Sierra’s body-on-frame design showed its limitations, sending some rather unpleasant shuddering through the passenger cabin. In the towing arena, the Sierra displayed little fuss while towing a 5,000-pound Airstream trailer, and the lane-departure warning and assist proved a valuable option worth every penny.
Interior ComfortWith big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, GMC’s 2016 Sierra’s roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be luxurious, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers’ devices. Cab configurations include regular with a 3-passenger bench, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.
Exterior StylingWe dub GMC’s latest styling experiment ""contemporary macho."" Like previous GMC trucks, this full-size pickup features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck proud. With the new styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5-feet-8 inches to eight feet. Double-cab models now have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED INFOTAINMENTFor 2016, GMC’s Sierra full-size pickup features two IntelliLink audio systems, one with a 7-inch screen and the other, eight inches. Both systems can be equipped with OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi and are compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Five USB ports and a 110-volt outlet are super handy.
DRIVER-ALERT SEATAs part of the 2016 GMC Sierra’s lane-departure and forward-collision warning, this vibrating driver’s seat alerts the driver of potential danger. Depending on the direction of the vehicle’s drift, the system sends vibrating pulses through the seat cushion’s left or right side.
Standard FeaturesEven the most basic 2016 GMC Sierra includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats and a 7-inch touch-screen AM/FM radio with USB/SD inputs, but no CD player, Bluetooth or telescoping steering wheel. Step up to an SLE trim and you’ll get a rearview camera, 6-speaker audio and 17-inch wheels made of premium aluminum instead of steel. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen command center, power-adjustable pedals and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali’s 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio and leather-clad front bucket seats.
Factory OptionsAdd-ons are available across the 2016 Sierra lineup to make it more functional and comfortable. All Sierras can be ordered as 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel (4WD), while those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Options include the Driver Alert Package with lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, IntelliBeam headlights and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package features off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available for the 2016 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8 and the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. The V6 is linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter employ an 8-speed automatic, but only when ordered with the SLE and Denali trim. All three engines have laudable towing capacity, including the V6’s max of 7,200 pounds. The 6.2-liter V8 can pull up to 12,000 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,500 pounds and a highway rating of 23 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC’s engine lineup. All engines use direct injection and Active Fuel Management, which allows them to run on fewer cylinders and thus use less fuel.

Other new options include lane-keep assist, power-articulating-assist steps and two new audio systems featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
If you like big and blocky, GMC’s 2016 Sierra 1500 pickup truck’s got your name written all over it. Sharing its mechanical foundations with the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC adds more styling and features to elevate the Sierra 1500 above the average full-size pickup. Although the Ford and Ram can be decked out with features that easily rival the Sierra, the same cannot be said for the Toyota Tundra or Nissan Titan. Of course, this description applies only to the upper SLT and Denali trims; the base work truck is just as pedestrian as its competitors’ base models. What matters most to pickup buyers, however, is the ability to tow, haul and accelerate. To this end, the 2016 GMC Sierra 1500 excels in every category.

About the only main rival that starts less is the Kia Forte, though a base Nissan Sentra and Dodge Dart are close. In reality, most buyers will opt for a better-equipped Cruze, and with that in mind we recommend the Cruze LT, which rings in for under $21,000 with a manual transmission and less than $22K with an automatic. Fully loaded, a Cruze Premier can reach beyond $29,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Cruze. The Chevy Cruze’s resale value has traditionally trailed leaders like the Subaru Impreza, Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.
Driving the Used 2016 Chevrolet CruzeThe latest Cruze continues to do what it’s always done best: provide a comfortable, quiet and composed ride. If you’re looking for a small sedan that drives more like a midsize one, this Chevrolet is for you. Power from the standard 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine is average for this segment. It won’t wow you with its acceleration, but it’s hardly slow. Moreover, the little engine plays nicely with the 6-speed automatic transmission for which most buyers will opt. Chevy touts the Cruze as ""athletic,"" but we’ll leave that descriptor for the Mazda3. More apt for the Cruze is ""comfortable."" And in a segment where too many players are trying to dazzle with dynamics, we find it refreshing to find one that’s actually just a really good highway cruiser.
Interior ComfortThe Cruze’s interior is much like its exterior in that it looks good without being flashy. This is a sensible place with a fair amount of room and logically placed controls. Highlights include a central-mounted touch-screen display and good ol’ knobs and buttons for audio and climate functions. We found both cloth and the optional leather front seats comfortable, but wish there were adjustable lumbar support. Rear-seat legroom has grown over the prior model, though trunk space has decreased a hair. The rear seat folds for larger items, but you’ll have to step up to an LT model for 60/40-split folding action.
Exterior StylingThe new Cruze has grown a couple of inches in length from the outgoing model, but still sports a small, easy-to-park footprint. More noticeable is the Cruze’s new skin. The latest model has a sleeker and swoopier shape, with an all-new face and sweeping headlights, and a nicely buttoned-up rear with less-chunky taillights. Its roof is nicely tapered at the rear, and even the sides are more interesting with their creases. We still deem the Cruze rather conservative, and that’s hardly a bad thing. We think its lines will hold up well in the years to come.
Favorite Features24/7 PROMISE Odd name, awesome feature. In a first for Chevy, all 2016 Cruze LT and Premier models will come with 24 months/24 gigs of 4G LTE Wi-Fi, 24 months of SiriusXM satellite radio, 24 months of OnStar guidance, two routine maintenance services, and 5 years/60,000 miles of roadside assistance.
 HIGH FUEL-EFFICIENCY Remember when 40 mpg was reserved for hybrids? With today’s small but efficient engines, that number is reality for small sedans like the 2016 Chevy Cruze. All models earn at least 40 mpg/highway, topping out at 42 mpg. A new diesel Cruze will replace the prior one that earned 46 mpg. 
Standard FeaturesFor 2016, the Cruze comes in four main trims: L, LS, LT and Premier. The bargain-basement L, offered only with a manual transmission, is pretty basic but does have a 7-inch MyLink infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, rearview camera, 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, built-in 4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi (subscription-based), and a 4-speaker audio system with AM/FM/USB and auxiliary inputs. LS models add extra bits like a nicer steering wheel, floormats, armrests, and the availability of an automatic transmission. All Cruze models come with 10 airbags, 6-month trial to OnStar Guidance and two scheduled maintenance visits.
Factory OptionsWe recommend the Cruze LT. In addition to offering a manual or automatic transmission, it packs more features yet maintains an affordable price. It includes the 24/7 Promise connectivity package, 6-speaker audio system, cruise control, 16-inch aluminum wheels, and steering-wheel-mounted audio and phone controls. Manual models even come with the sporty RS appearance package. Top-line Premier models include leather seats, visors with illuminated vanity mirrors, 17-inch wheels, and an improved rear suspension that builds on the standard torsion beam. Options include Bose audio, sunroof, navigation, wireless phone charging, and safety features like blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and forward-collision alert.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2016 Cruze models feature a new, turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine. With 153 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, it is more powerful than the previous 1.4-liter turbo, and more efficient, too. Power is sent to the front wheels via a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. Though turbocharged, this little engine is happy to drink regular unleaded gasoline. Next year, Chevy plans to go forth with a diesel Cruze sedan that is expected to be even more efficient. 1.4-liter inline-4 153 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm 177 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 29/41 mpg (manual), 30/42 mpg (automatic), 30/40 (automatic, Premier trim)

Driving the Used 2016 BMW 5 SeriesRegardless if you want a rear-drive or all-wheel-drive 5 Series (dubbed “xDrive” by BMW), you’ll end up with one of the best driving, best handling sedans available. The 2016 BMW 5 Series luxury performance sedans are noted for their power and excellent driving characteristics. Even the base 528i with its 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder can scoot to 60 mph in around six seconds, an impressive feat considering the 5 Series’ size. However, those in the know will probably be more comfortable with the 535i, which features an inline 6-cylinder engine offering up more muscle without a significant downturn in fuel economy. If money is no object, however, then the ultimate 5 Series is the M5. With a 560-horsepower turbocharged V8 under its hood, the 2016 BMW M5 demonstrates scorching performance, an advanced and luxurious interior and a pedigree that is the envy of the sports-car world.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 5 Series from BMW features a wide, driver-centric dash and controls, premium materials, and good room for occupants and their luggage. Controls for climate, audio and vehicle dynamics are generally easy to use. BMW’s large command dial to the right of the stubby gear selector requires a learning curve – we suggest putting the vehicle in park and practicing its functions before getting under way. The sedan’s 14-cubic-foot trunk offers good space, and standard 60/40-folding rear seats have more flexibility. With its hatchback design and flat load floor, the 5 Series Gran Turismo offers even more cargo capacity.
Exterior StylingThe 2016 BMW 5 Series sedan’s design announces the car’s athleticism without chasing fads. Up front is the requisite twin-kidney grille, the sides are crisply creased, and the rear features a nicely tapered trunk and contoured LED light strips. M5 models are identified by their quad-exhaust outlets. While the 5 Series sedan is anything but controversial, the same cannot be said about the somewhat bloated 5 Series Gran Turismo. Despite its awkward rear, the tailgate sports a dual-access design that allows you to open a smaller trunklid or the entire hatch to load larger items.
Favorite FeaturesDIESEL ENGINESoot-free, quiet and sophisticated, today’s diesel engines have come a long way. In the 2016 BMW 535d sedan, the diesel engine delivers gobs of torque, great fuel economy and less maintenance.
M SPORT PACKAGEDesigned with the driver in mind, BMW’s M Sport Package beefs up the factory 5 Series with lightweight 18-inch alloy wheels, a sport suspension and an increase in the limited top speed.
Standard FeaturesEven a base BMW 528i is well-equipped, as should be expected in a $51,000 sedan. Highlights include a standard navigation system, moonroof, bright xenon headlights, automatic climate control, a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD system with HD Radio reception, and 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with all-season run-flat tires. Surprisingly, leather is still an option on base models, which use leather-like upholstery. Go one trim higher with the 535i and you get the real thing. Also extra is a rearview camera, something becoming standard on cars from mainstream brands. New BMWs include Ultimate Service, which includes four years/50,000 miles of scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsAs with all BMWs, the 2016 5 Series offers a lengthy options list both in package and stand-alone form. As daunting – and expensive – as this may be, one nice aspect is that most features are available across the line. That means you don’t have to step up trims to have the 20-way climate-controlled front seats with massage function, hands-free trunk opener, full LED lights, Bang & Olufsen audiophile system, rear-seat entertainment screens, or a package that bundles features like lane-departure warning, active cruise control and a bird’s-eye-view camera system. And we haven’t even mentioned performance upgrades.
Engine & TransmissionBecause it’s a 5 Series, even the base 4-cylinder is lively and efficient, delivering up to 34 mpg in the EPA’s highway cycle. The 5 Series’ mid-tier powerplant is a turbocharged inline-6. The turbodiesel, also an inline-6, generates a monstrous 413 lb-ft of torque yet soundly beats the gasoline-electric ActiveHybrid 5 in fuel economy. In addition to not matching the diesel’s fuel economy, the pricier hybrid’s 26-mpg city/highway combined rating is only two better than a 535i and its highway rating is less.

It’s comfortable, available with serious off-road hardware, and can tow up to 7,400 pounds. Variants widen appeal, from a diesel model that earns up to 30 mpg to the bad-boy Grand Cherokee SRT packing 475 horsepower.","ConsIf you don’t plan to do much off-roading or substantial towing, check out a less-rugged crossover SUV such as the Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Kia Sorento or Honda Pilot, which also can seat seven or eight passengers.",31000,"Driving the Used 2016 Jeep Grand CherokeeConsiderable off-road chops aside, the 2016 Grand Cherokee is more likely to spend its life on pavement. Unlike the rougher-riding Jeep Wrangler, the Grand Cherokee is pleasing on the highway and around town. The GC’s resilient and composed highway ride belies its rugged demeanor. But there’s no escaping the wind noise rushing around the outside mirrors and boxy shape at highway speeds. Still, it’s a reasonable compromise, especially considering how capable the Grand Cherokee is when the pavement ends. With ample ground clearance, good power and multiple off-road modes, the Grand Cherokee excels. The EcoDiesel is smooth and refined, but its $4,500 premium and pricey urea refills every 10,000 miles drive us to recommend the standard V6 or 5.7-liter Hemi V8 instead. If you crave speed and family hauling, the 475-horsepower Grand Cherokee SRT is just the ticket. Speeding ticket, that is.
Interior ComfortThe new Grand Cherokee spans from a reasonably comfortable SUV to one that could give luxury brands a run for their money. All models are 2-row/5-passenger — there is no option for a third row. This layout offers good room for passengers and a healthy 36.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats. Folded, that space expands to 68.3 cubic feet. Base Laredo models look the part with cloth, manually adjusted front seats, but stepping up just one trim brings power operation to the driver. Higher-end models are awash in leather and feature heated and ventilated front seats.
Exterior StylingThe 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee has a muscular, handsome design. True to its off-road intent, the GC has 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with the performance-oriented SRT model sitting slightly lower. The Limited 75th Anniversary model gets a unique front end with mesh grille and accents. All Grand Cherokees have Jeep’s signature 7-slot grille, and higher-end models feature extra helpings of chrome. Despite its tall profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, but you can opt for the power-operated liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesUCONNECT ACCESS Jeep’s Uconnect combines easy-to-use, easy-to-see connected-car technology with a simple interface.  Key to its user-friendliness are the optional large 8.4-inch touch panel and voice recognition to access the navigation, or mobile apps like Bing Local Search and Pandora. It also includes hands-free text messaging.
 QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION The 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s optional Quadra-Lift air suspension lets Jeep owners pick from five different vehicle-height settings. At its highest, the 10.6 inches of ground clearance beat even the Wrangler Rubicon. The system can also be lowered, improving aerodynamics as well as facilitating entry and exit.
Standard FeaturesAs mentioned, the least expensive Grand Cherokee, the Laredo, still requires drivers to manually adjust their seat, but does come with dual-zone climate control, a digital instrument cluster, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry and a 6-speaker audio system with a 5-inch touch screen. For less than $5,000 more, we recommend stepping up to at least the Laredo 75th Anniversary Edition, which includes the 8.4-inch Uconnect system, heated and power-operated front seats, heated steering wheel, auto-dimming rearview mirror, rearview camera with backup sensors and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsThe Jeep Grand Cherokee’s 4-wheel-drive (4WD) system is optional, and a must if you intend to go Jeeping in your Jeep. The Quadra-Lift air suspension plus the top-spec Quadra-Drive II 4WD system are essential for any hard-core off-roader. The standard halogen headlights are so-so at best, so the optional xenon setup is a better bet. In a true sign of the times, a CD player has been relegated to the options list. Other options: a Blu-ray entertainment center, dual-pane sunroof and 19-speaker harman/kardon audio system, plus blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning with crash mitigation and lane-departure warning.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee is offered with several engine choices. There’s the standard 3.6-liter V6, which offers good power and fuel economy. The 5.7-liter V8 amps up the power noticeably, but fuel economy suffers. On the flip side, there’s the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6, which offers the most torque of any engine save the SRT’s V8 and gets great fuel economy. The Grand Cherokee SRT is a completely different animal. With a 475-horsepower 6.4-liter V8, its standard 4-wheel-drive system is meant for the street, not the trail, proven by its 4.8-second 0-60-mph time. All Grand Cherokees come with an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. Two-wheel-drive (2WD) models are now only available with V6 engines, while 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optional on all models and standard on the SRT.
 3.6-liter V6 290 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm 260 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/26 mpg (2WD), 18/25 mpg (4WD)

Read Full Review","What's New?Only slight revisions are in store for the 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee. They include enhanced fuel economy, electric power steering, and a 5-horsepower increase in 3.6-liter V6 models (to 295). The high-performance Grand Cherokee SRT receives a new instrument-panel gauge cluster and drive modes. Also, V8 Grand Cherokees are now only offered in 4-wheel drive.
The Jeep Grand Cherokee is the flagship model from the iconic SUV brand. As a 2-row, 5-passenger SUV, it competes on paper with midsize sport-utility vehicles like the Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. But the Grand Cherokee is unique in its ""Jeep-ness"" — its purpose-built ability to go off-road. In this respect it’s more like a tough Toyota 4Runner. But the 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee is available in a wider variety of trims, with multiple engine choices that include a Hemi V8 and diesel V6, and a host of comfort and safety features. The Grand Cherokee is as adept on-road as it is off. For adventurous individuals and families desiring a roomy, competent and comfortable SUV, it’s hard to beat the Jeep Grand Cherokee.

A 3-mode steering system allows the driver to adjust steering feel from firm to lightweight, while the Santa Fe’s suspension permits confident cornering without punishing occupants with a rough ride. The Santa Fe’s interior is well isolated from most exterior noise, although we think the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer are a bit quieter. When it comes to power, however, the Santa Fe sport wants for nothing, with a 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 teamed to an efficient 6-speed automatic. This combo delivers impressive acceleration and mid-range passing power (40-60 mph), although things slow up just a hair when equipped with the heavier all-wheel-drive (AWD) option.
Interior ComfortThere’s plenty of room in the 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe, and the driver’s front view is panoramic (the rearward view is less broad, but you’re never reduced to driving purely with the mirrors). The base model’s stain-resistant cloth fabric feels good, plus the audio and climate-control knobs and buttons are glove-friendly big. All materials are impressive down to the rubber that lines the inside of the door pulls. The first two rows are completely livable for adults, while the third row is a decent kid’s row. The Santa Fe does give up some cargo area compared to the competition, however.
Exterior StylingLooking for all the world like what it is – an extended-wheelbase Santa Fe Sport without the sporty rear-side-window kick-up – the new Santa Fe has more to say about handsome, contemporary styling than it does about swooping lines that characterize the shapes of Hyundai passenger cars. Nice touch 1: Even in base SE form, the outside mirrors and bumpers are body-color. Integrated fog lights, roof rails and 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels are the exterior differences between the SE and upscale Limited versions. Nice touch 2: The Santa Fe SE gets smaller 18-inch wheels, but at least they are aluminum-alloy.
Favorite FeaturesHYUNDAI BLUE LINK TELEMATICSBlue Link not only provides essential services such as news, weather, turn-by-turn navigation and SOS emergency assistance, it can also rat out your misbehaving teenager by sending a text message when the vehicle passes your preset speed limit, is out past curfew or travels beyond a set perimeter.
PANORAMIC SUNROOFWith a massive glass panel spanning all three rows, the Santa Fe’s panoramic sunroof allows sunlight to fill the cabin. With the push of a button, the panel can tilt up to help improve circulation, or open completely providing a rush of fresh air.
Standard FeaturesSanta Fe SE drivers with a long journey ahead will appreciate the multi-adjustable front bucket seats with power-adjustable lumbar support. Passengers farther back will give thanks to the 3rd-row controls for air conditioning and heating. Stepping up to the Santa Fe Limited includes luxuries like leather seating – power-adjustable and heated for the driver and front passenger – push-button starting and heated captain’s chairs for the second row. The Limited also upgrades the audio system with a 4.3-inch color display and adds a rearview camera. Sweet as ever, Hyundai’s confidence-inspiring 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranties cover the new Santa Fe.
Factory OptionsBeyond a laundry list of individual options like a heated steering wheel, navigation system, premium audio and AWD, Hyundai is pushing option packages. For the Santa Fe SE, the Ultimate Package includes said leather and navigation plus a host of comfort and convenience upgrades. The Limited’s Ultimate Package scores you navigation and a 12-speaker Infinity Logic 7 audio system, plus the Panoramic Sunroof, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, HID headlights, rear backup sensors and manual rear-side-window sunshades. Sadly, no rear-seat-entertainment pacifier is available on the 2016 Santa Fe, but an iPad or two is likely a cheaper solution, anyway.
Engine & TransmissionHyundai makes it simple to shop for a 7-passenger 2016 Santa Fe by offering only one engine and one transmission. In front-wheel-drive form (FWD), the SUV’s 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 is very well matched to the 6-speed automatic transmission, with good throttle response, smooth pickup and clean, easy shifts. The AWD Santa Fe, though, could do with some more low-end grunt to get it moving. All that said, Hyundai’s 2016 Santa Fe is comfortable towing up to 5,000 pounds of trailer, boat or anything else you’d like to haul.

Read Full Review","What's New?There are a few minor changes to the 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe 7-passanger crossover SUV. The GLS trim is renamed SE and the saddle interior option has been dropped. Hyundai’s Smart Liftgate with auto open is made standard on Limited and optional on the SE.
While there are numerous 3-row family crossover SUVs from which to choose, picking the Hyundai Santa Fe for 2016 won’t leave you with buyer’s remorse. The Santa Fe’s sleek exterior has the edge on older SUVs such as the GMC Acadia, while steering clear of more polarizing designs like the new Nissan Pathfinder. With seating for seven, a large cargo bay and one of the most powerful V6 engines in its class, the 2016 Santa Fe from Hyundai has no problem handling large loads. It can even match the new Honda Pilot with a tow rating of 5,000 pounds. Toss in Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile warranty and rapidly improving reliability and resale figures, and the 2016 Santa Fe crossover SUV begins to seem like a no-brainer.

Additionally, while the base prices are good, they escalate quickly when you start adding options, making them less than a bargain than you might think.",16800,"Driving the Used 2016 Kia ForteThe 2016 Kia Forte lineup is a great choice if you’re looking for a comfortable, feature-filled and sporty-looking sedan, coupe, or hatchback. Note we said sporty-looking; despite the 201-horsepower 4-cylinder available in the Forte Koup 2-door and Forte5 hatchback, enthusiasts will still prefer driving the Mazda3, Honda Civic Si, or Volkswagen Jetta or GTI. Still, we like the added power, and if you’re among the 99 percent of buyers who just want a solid daily driver, it won’t matter. Around town and on the highway, the Forte sedan, coupe and hatchback are all excellent choices. Multiple creature comforts coddle driver and passenger alike, and even the base engine feels plenty of power; the turbo is just gravy. Regardless, the Forte lineup is a solidly economical choice as a daily driver.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Kia Forte interior mixes tech, comfort and even a little whimsy with the ripples on the passenger-side dash. That dash is soft-touch, by the way, an example of the overall quality of materials you’ll find inside. The comfortable driver’s seat is available with heating and cooling, and there’s also an available heated steering wheel. The rear seat is roomy for the class, and also offers optional heating for the outboard positions, a rarity at this price point. If you need more cargo room than the standard 15-cubic-foot trunk, the Forte5 hatchback offers 23 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingIt’s hard to believe that the 2016 Kia Forte and the Hyundai Elantra are cousins under the skin. However, despite being not quite as flashy as the Hyundai, we think the 2016 Forte will look fresh longer than the Elantra has. The LED headlight accents are a nice touch, and the 2-door Forte Koup and hatchback Forte5 manage to add more style to the lineup without undermining the conservative aesthetic. Here, Kia’s healthy addiction to category-first features manifests itself in power-folding exterior mirrors, puddle lamps and illuminated door-handle pockets.
Favorite FeaturesUVO ESERVICESLike many Kia vehicles, its integrated telematics system UVO is one of the highlights. Among its many capabilities, it will use your connected phone to automatically call 911 if an airbag deploys. You can also send directions from your phone to the navigation system.
FORTE5 HATCHBACKYou can count the number of affordable compact hatchbacks on one hand – if you skip crossover SUVs – and we’re happy that Kia remains committed to serving this small but fanatical niche of the market.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Kia Forte LX sedan and Forte5 hatchback both come with keyless entry this year, in addition to standard features like Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, air conditioning and a split-folding rear seat. Note that the base model lacks many of the class-leading features that distinguish the Forte, and even comes with steel wheels and a manual transmission. A better bet is the EX trim level, available on all three body styles, that includes things like aluminum-alloy wheels, at a higher price, of course. A full complement of active and passive safety features are standard on every Forte.
Factory OptionsThere are a lot of options available for the 2016 Kia Forte: navigation, leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control and Kia’s UVO infotainment system. It’s all included in the Forte’s Premium Plus package. Forte Koup and Forte5 models offer an even higher trim level than EX called SX that adds the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 201 horsepower, as well as 18-inch wheels. The Technology Package on this model adds navigation, heated and cooled seats, and other niceties like a power moonroof. However, that loaded Forte5 also costs more than $27,000, stretching the definition of affordable nearly to the breaking point.
Engine & TransmissionThe base model 2016 Forte LX sedan has a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder putting out 148 horsepower. It’s a good reason to start your Forte Sedan shopping at the EX level, where you get the more robust 173-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that’s standard in the Koup and Forte5 hatchback, including the Forte5 LX. Available on the Forte Koup SX and Forte5 SX is a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 201 horsepower. All 2016 Forte models are front-wheel drive, with power transmitted through either a 6-speed automatic transmission, or in some models, a 6-speed manual. The little 1.8-liter 4-cylinder gets 39 mpg on the highway, and that good number may be its saving grace. For the most part, though, the Forte’s fuel economy trails many of today’s compact cars.

The 2016 Kia Forte is one of the most comprehensive compact-car lineups you’ll find.

The sporty Forte Koup is a 2-door model available with a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that makes 201 horsepower. The Forte5 hatchback offers a cargo-friendly, Euro-look hatchback, and is available with the turbocharged engine. It’s a strong lineup when pitted against the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Ford Focus, and it makes picking a good compact car that much harder.

Those wanting a more rugged off-roader would be better off in a Toyota 4Runner (Nissan’s own Xterra has ended its run).",30680,"Driving the Used 2016 Nissan PathfinderIf refinement and car-like handling are more important than the ability to crawl down craters, the 2016 Nissan Pathfinder deserves a spot at the top of your shopping list. Thanks to its unit body, the 7-passenger Pathfinder can accommodate a modern suspension that returns a stable, smooth ride and compliant road manners. Body roll is minimal even under hard cornering, and the nicely weighted steering feels responsive and on-center. Last year’s revamp of the Pathfinder’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) made it feel more natural, and Nissan’s 260-horsepower V6 continues to be a strong performer. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is the standard setup for the Pathfinder, while an All-Mode 4×4-i intelligent all-wheel-drive (AWD) system is optional on all trims. The system enhances traction and offers a full-lock setting for use on rough or slippery terrain.
Interior ComfortAll versions of the Nissan Pathfinder can seat up to seven passengers across three rows. Legroom is generous in the first two rows, but the last row is tight for adults. We like the charcoal coloring of the seating surfaces, contrasted by white stitching. Thankfully, Nissan passed on the finicky, all-touch infotainment systems used by others. Here, you can easily tune the radio or adjust the volume by twisting a dial. The same goes for setting the temperature and fan speed. Other features we like include a hidden storage bin aft of the third row, built-in tie-downs and flip-out coat hooks.
Exterior StylingNo longer the squared-off utility vehicle it used to be, the latest-gen Pathfinder is all windswept curves and rounded edges. A large, upward sloping grille and two large headlight housings convey toughness, but for the most part the latest Pathfinder projects a friendly image. Roof rails add functionality to the Pathfinder, and the optional dual-panel moonroof does a great job of opening up the cabin, even for 3rd-row passengers. With just seven inches of ground clearance, today’s Pathfinder isn’t meant for hard-core off-roading.
Favorite FeaturesAROUND VIEW MONITORNissan’s clever Around View monitor places four cameras at various positions outside the Pathfinder to create a bird’s-eye 360-degree image. The cameras also show individual images of what is ahead and behind the Pathfinder. It’s a real help when maneuvering in tight spaces.
EZ FLEX LATCH & GLIDE SYSTEMAnother innovative Nissan feature, the EZ Flex & Glide System found on the 2016 Pathfinder SUV allows a child seat latched in the second row to remain attached when the seats are slid forward, typically to allow access to the 3rd-row seat.
Standard FeaturesThe Pathfinder is available in four main trims: S, SV, SL and Platinum. The least expensive 2016 Pathfinder S model comes with tri-zone climate control, push-button ignition, 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and an AM/FM/6-CD audio system. Missing in action is Bluetooth wireless connectivity. We recommend stepping up to at least an SV, as its extra features justify its roughly $3,000 premium. They include Bluetooth, a rearview monitor, rear sonar parking assistance, power-adjustable driver’s seat and upgraded audio system with USB input, satellite radio and more.
Factory OptionsStepping up to the SL trim brings a power liftgate, leather seating, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, power-adjustable front passenger seat, blind-spot monitoring and a convenient 120-volt AC power outlet in the second row. Top-line Platinum models come with navigation system, panoramic moonroof, heated and cooled front seats, the Around View monitor, Bose premium audio system, 20-inch wheels and power-adjustable steering wheel. All-wheel drive is available on all trims, while packages and options such as a rear-seat entertainment system vary by trim level. One particularly interesting accessory is a hatch tent that makes the Pathfinder campsite-ready.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2016 Nissan Pathfinder SUV uses a V6 engine that has a good balance of power and fuel economy. It can tow up to 5,000 pounds and returns up to 27 mpg. The sole transmission is a continuously variable automatic, which thanks to an enhancement last year to Nissan’s D-Step Shift Logic feels more like a traditional automatic with stepped gears. All Pathfinders come in front-wheel drive (FWD), and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional for those desiring the extra traction it provides. Unlike many luxury SUVs, the Pathfinder happily runs on regular unleaded. 
3.5-liter V6 260 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm 240 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (FWD), 19/26 mpg (AWD)
Read Full Review","What's New?The Pathfinder receives only minimal revisions for 2016. They include a Cold Package that’s now available for SV trims and a standard heated steering wheel in SL grades.
Three years after its metamorphosis from a rugged, truck-based SUV to a more efficient, smoother-riding sedan-based crossover SUV, the 2016 Nissan Pathfinder remains a smart choice among 3-row family haulers. Nissan’s midsize crossover SUV offers nifty features like the Around View bird’s-eye monitor and one of the easiest 3rd-row-access systems available, but unlike the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Chevy Traverse, the Pathfinder seats only seven rather than up to eight like its rivals. That limitation aside, the Pathfinder stacks up well thanks to its powerful-yet-efficient V6 engine, roomy interior and refined driving manners. While it is no longer a serious off-roader, all-wheel drive is available for better traction in foul weather, and towing capacity is a respectable 5,000 pounds.

With its good fuel economy, plus cool tech like Apple CarPlay, the Colorado even appeals to crossover-SUV buyers.","ConsIf you frequently tow more than 7,700 pounds, need more interior room, or just need more capability than a compact or midsize truck can offer, then a full-size truck or SUV might be more your speed. And, truth be told, the Colorado doesn’t have the Toyota Tacoma’s off-road chops.",21000,"Driving the Used 2016 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabThere’s really no bad engine choice when it comes to the 2016 Colorado, but there’s definitely a best choice: the new 2.8-liter Duramax diesel. It’s surprisingly smooth and quiet, with its diesel soundtrack just enough to remind you that it’s special, but not so much to be intrusive. There’s also excellent power delivery, with a nice smooth swell of torque from right off the line that carries up to the redline. This is the premium engine, though; budget-minded folks will likely stick with the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder or 3.6-liter V6, both of which are also surprisingly well sorted. All come with a 6-speed automatic transmission, but the gasoline-powered 4-cylinder can also be equipped with a 6-speed manual. Around town the 2016 Colorado offers a ride that is smooth enough to woo SUV drivers, but not so plush that it would be mistaken for one.
Interior ComfortChevrolet walks a difficult tightrope with the 2016 Colorado. To attract non-traditional truck buyers, it’s comfortable and quiet, and the front seats, easy-to-use controls, and surprisingly good rear seat – in Crew Cab models at least – are easy to live with. We especially like premium features like the heated seats, Apple CarPlay, and an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system. Yet it also has to maintain the ruggedness one expects of a truck, which explains the tough-feeling plastics, comfortable but durable seat upholstery, and touches like the foldable rear seat.
Exterior StylingWhile there’s no mistaking the 2016 Chevy Colorado for anything but a midsize pickup truck, the curves and lines are softened away from the in-your-face boldness that’s found on today’s full-size trucks, and even the new Toyota Tacoma. That also goes for the Trail Boss add-ons, which include a flying-buttress-style light bar in the bed, super-bright LED spotlights, and other accessories. It’s easy to use, too, thanks to the standard CornerStep rear bumper that makes it easy to get into the bed, and the available EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate, which allows you to lift the tailgate with one hand.
Favorite FeaturesDURAMAX DIESELThe new 2.8-liter Duramax diesel may just be the best thing to happen to the midsize-truck market since the Chevy Colorado itself. Smooth and powerful, it offers up a superior driving experience compared to either gasoline engine, and any of its competitors’ engines, too.
APPLE CARPLAYThere are two things we like about Apple CarPlay in the 2016 Colorado. First, the slick integration of your smartphone into the touch-screen display is pretty much exactly what we’ve been waiting for. Second, it’s standard on LT and Z71 models.
Standard FeaturesThe base-model 2016 Chevy Colorado is the stripped-down model that your next pizza delivery guy will be driving, but it still includes the utility-enhancing CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate and cargo-box lighting, air conditioning, a 4.2-inch touch-screen audio system with USB, and power windows. The reality is that Colorado buyers who aren’t managing a fleet will likely start at the more lavishly equipped LT, which includes the 8-inch touch-screen display with Apple CarPlay, an enhanced multicolor information display between the gauges, nicer wheels and interior trim, three months of Sirius satellite radio, cruise control and OnStar.
Factory OptionsThe 2016 Colorado offers two engine options – the 3.6-liter V6 or new Duramax diesel – plus available 4-wheel drive with a low-speed transfer case. You can also pick an extended cab or crew-cab body, plus a standard length or long bed. Other features include a spray-on bedliner, fog lights, cross rails for the cargo-box storage system and a locking rear differential. Safety can be enhanced with Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning, and there are even luxury touches like seat heaters for the driver and front passenger.
Engine & TransmissionIn addition to last year’s 2.5-liter 4-cylinder or 3.6-liter V6, there’s the new 2.8-liter Duramax 4-cylinder diesel. All come with a 6-speed automatic transmission, although the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is also available with a 6-speed manual. The 200-horsepower 2.5-liter gas-powered 4-cylinder is a surprisingly good engine, and although the 3.6-liter, with its 305 horsepower, is clearly stronger, 4-cylinder buyers will likely be happy with their choice for either the 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive (2WD, 4WD) model. The diesel is the premium engine, and its 369 lb-ft of torque is 100 more than the V6, giving the Duramax a maximum towing capacity of 7,700 pounds. The two gasoline engines use regular unleaded, the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder getting an EPA estimated 27 mpg on the highway when equipped with the automatic.

Read Full Review","What's New?All-new last year, the 2016 Chevy Colorado adds a new 4-cylinder Duramax diesel engine, plus cool technology like Apple CarPlay.
The 2016 Chevrolet Colorado expands on its popularity with a unique proposition: a new Duramax 4-cylinder turbodiesel engine. It expands the towing capacity of the Colorado to 7,700 pounds, and promises to bump the fuel economy significantly as well. Yet it all comes with a surprising amount of refinement, enhancing the Colorado’s day-to-day drivability. Also new are Apple CarPlay and an off-road package known as ""Trail Boss."" Combine it with features like Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and a standard rearview camera, and the 2016 Chevy Colorado has the goods to go toe-to-toe not just with the segment-leading and all-new 2016 Toyota Tacoma, but also against crossover SUVs that may have left the midsize-truck market when it became stagnant.

The new Camaro offers the kind of handling and braking that was once the exclusive purview of higher-end European sports coupes and sedans, all with distinctly American styling and big V8 rumble.","ConsIf you want European interior sophistication to match your driving dynamics, you might be disappointed by the new Camaro’s hard plastics. Similarly, the narrow windows result in a decidedly pinched rear view; claustrophobics, stay away.",26700,"Driving the Used 2016 Chevrolet CamaroChevy’s new Camaro is smaller than its predecessor by at least an inch pretty much every dimension – width, height and length – and it loses at least 200 pounds. The upshot is that the new Camaro feels more nimble and lively as soon as you get behind the wheel. The automatic transmission is a new 8-speed that we’ve grown to appreciate in other GM vehicles, and it offers up slick shifts and paddle shifting, enhancing the fun-to-drive quotient rather than diminishing it. A 6-speed manual transmission is available for those who still want to shift for themselves. All Camaros are also available with Brembo brakes – they’re standard on the V8-powered SS – for superior stopping ability. Put it all together and you have a car that offers the driving sophistication of a European luxury-sports sedan, but for considerably less money.
Interior ComfortClever touches abound inside the new 2016 Camaro. The new climate controls use the trim rings around the center vents to control temperature and fan speed, reducing dash clutter. The design and materials are better than before, but still lag behind the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger. The comfortable and sporty seats offer good support for hard cornering, and the big gauges are easy to read. The touch-screen infotainment system includes standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but the screen reflects interior surfaces like crazy. We’ve ignored the rear seat, and after one glance, you will too.
Exterior StylingIt’s funny how the previous-generation car never looked oversized until we laid eyes on the 2016 Camaro. The lines are tidy and clean, but look spot-on regardless of which model you’re looking at. The crisp styling still owes something to the classic 1969 model, but in reality it’s more of an updated look at the last-generation car. The headlights seem impossibly thin, and we like the aggressive width of the fenders coupled with the low-slung roof. Sadly, that same combination narrows the windows and makes it nearly impossible to see out the back of the Camaro.
Favorite FeaturesAPPLE CARPLAY/ANDROID AUTOThe 2016 Camaro is one of the first cars available with Apple’s excellent CarPlay system, and we’re loving it. Connecting is a matter of plugging in your phone to the USB port, and it’s literally as easy to use as your iPhone. Don’t worry: Android Auto is on its way.
DRIVE-MODE SELECTORA toggle behind the shifter on the new Camaro lets drivers fine-tune their car’s throttle response. In a fuel-saving mood? Select Eco. There’s a Sport mode for when you want to have some fun, and Touring for everyday driving. There’s even a Track mode for the V8-powered Camaro SS.
Standard FeaturesThe base model 2016 Camaro 1LT comes with the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and a 6-speed manual transmission. There’s also a 7-inch touch-screen audio system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual USB ports, an AUX input, and GM’s 4GLTE Wi-Fi hotspot technology. There’s also Bluetooth, automatic climate control, cruise control, and a color driver-information display between the main gauges. Upscale standard features include push-button start and keyless entry, power driver and passenger seats, a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel, and the Driver Select Mode. There are also multiple airbags and advanced stability control to help keep you safe.
Factory OptionsThe two most notable options are under the hood in the form of a 335-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 for the Camaro LT, or the new 455-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 in the new Camaro SS. Beyond engine choices and the new 8-speed automatic, the new Camaro offers an upgraded audio system with a larger touch screen, and an enhanced driver-information center that’s similar to the multi-configurable system on the Chevrolet Corvette. A 2016 Camaro SS also adds available magnetic ride-control suspension, power sunroof, in-dash navigation for those times when your iPhone doesn’t have a signal, and a dual-mode exhaust system.
Engine & TransmissionStandard is the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which may go against the standard muscle-car formula that says more cylinders are better, but this engine packs a punch. The upgrade from that is a more powerful (but with less torque) 3.6-liter V6 engine, with advanced fuel injection and, for the first time, cylinder deactivation for better fuel economy. But the real news is the V8, of course, now with 6.2 liters pumping out 455 horsepower in new Camaro SS models, the most powerful Camaro SS ever made. Transmissions range from the standard 6-speed manual that includes automatic rev matching on V8 models to the new 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters. Fuel-economy numbers aren’t yet available, but should improve thanks to the new engines and lighter body.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro is all-new this year. It shares its name and basic styling with last year’s model, but on a smaller, lighter and much more sophisticated chassis. The 3.6-liter V6 and 6.2-liter V8 are both more powerful, and the new turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder balances power and fuel economy.
It’s no stretch to say that the all-new 2016 Chevrolet Camaro feels more like a luxury-sports coupe from behind the wheel than a traditional muscle car. That’s because the new Camaro was developed from the same underpinnings as the Cadillac ATS, one of GM’s best-driving cars ever. The benefits go beyond just handling, too. The new Camaro looks similar to the previous generation, but the tidier dimensions make it look athletic where the old car looked ponderous. It’s lighter, allowing the V6 and V8 engines to pack a bigger punch than before while still getting better fuel economy. The view out the back is still pretty terrible, but there’s no mistake that the new Camaro is going to give the new Mustang night sweats.

Performance buffs will love the Abarth trim.","ConsIn the all-important realm of resale and reliability, the 2016 Fiat 500 has yet to surpass more established cars like the Honda Fit and Mini Cooper. Those with larger frames may find the 500’s interior a bit too snug for comfort.",18000,"Driving the Used 2016 FIAT 500eThe Fiat 500 subcompact for 2016 is pretty light on its feet, which is why it can get away with having only 101 horsepower under its diminutive bonnet. Acceleration and passing power are admittedly underwhelming, but in urban traffic the 500 zips about quite nicely. The 500’s go-kart-like handling allows it to dart through congested traffic, and its mere 140-inch length permits parking in the most unexpected places. The 500’s steering is precise with a nicely weighted wheel to help things along. Although a 5-speed manual is available, the majority of 500s will leave the showroom with Fiat’s 6-speed automatic. Opt for the 160-horsepower Abarth and you’ll get much better performance, improved handling and bit more respect from the bad boys. Looking to save the planet rather than conquer it? The electric 500e can travel up to 87 miles while emitting zero emissions.
Interior ComfortFiat’s subcompact 500 for 2016 is roomier up front than you might expect, and just as tight in back as it looks. The interior style lives up to the promise of the quirky but fashionable exterior, and we found the materials, build quality and seat comfort impressive for a car with a starting price around $18,000. As the athlete of the group, the Fiat 500 Abarth offers aggressively bolstered front seats, exclusive red stitching and a thick-rimmed, flat-bottom steering wheel.
Exterior StylingThe subcompact 2016 Fiat 500 is a modern interpretation of 1957’s tiny, rear-engined original. Although larger than the original, it’s still seven inches shorter than today’s Mini Cooper. The iconic sloping rear end embodies the 500’s personality, though it limits rear headroom. The Fiat 500 is available in a stretched 4-door model that alleviates many of the coupe’s shortcomings. The hatchback offers Pop, Easy, Sport, Lounge, 1957 and Turbo trim levels, while the soft-top 500c comes in Pop, Easy and Lounge. The Turbo, Abarth and 500e electric are their own packages. Wheels, fascias and body trim differentiate the models.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT POWER CONVERTIBLE TOP Unlike a conventional convertible that retracts into a well, the 2016 Fiat 500c employs a canvas roll-top design that opens the cabin to the outside world while leaving a protective metal frame in place. An added advantage is the top can be opened at speeds up to 60 mph. 
Eco:DRIVE As if there weren’t enough high-tech geekery in the world today, the Fiat 500 allows its owners to upload data about everything from trip information to CO2 emissions. The data can be stored on a flash drive where drivers can analyze it in hopes of improving driving efficiency.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Fiat 500 and 500c Pop include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15-inch covered steel wheels, a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, cruise control, power window/locks/mirrors, Bluetooth, and a 6-speaker audio system with a USB port for portable music players. The range-topping Abarth variant includes a 276-watt Alpine audio system, 16-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension and a leather-wrapped dashboard. Standard safety features include seven airbags, hill-start assist to help prevent vehicle rollback on steep inclines and seemingly all the other advancements we’re seeing on new cars in this price range and beyond.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded 2016 Fiat 500 Lounge includes a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather seats, heated front seats, rear parking sensors, Beats by Dr. Dre audio system and automatic climate control. The 500 Sport model is differentiated by a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch wheels and a variety of aesthetic touches including red brake calipers and a subtle rear spoiler. The Turbo model adds larger front brakes and more serious suspension tuning to go with its specific 16-inch wheels and identifying trim. The mighty Abarth offers larger 17-inch wheels, 2-tone leather-trimmed seats and your choice of either white or red body-side stripes.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive 2016 Fiat 500 is motivated by a small but sophisticated 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine using Fiat’s patented MultiAir technology, which varies intake-valve timing and lift. Fiat tunes this engine to three power levels: The base 500 gets 101 horsepower (naturally aspirated), the Turbo makes 135 horsepower and the Abarth, also turbocharged, cranks out 160 horsepower. The 500e electric is rated for 111 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. All of the 500s now offer the choice of a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. We like the automatic for its extra ratio and responsive shifting though it does cut fuel efficiency by more than 10 percent. The 500e uses a single-speed automatic.

The 2016 Fiat 500 coupe and its drop-top doppelganger, the 500c, have surprised a lot of skeptics. The duo prove that not only can a frugal small car be fun and colorful, it can also win over the hearts and minds of Americans accustomed to larger modes of transportation. Although not as large as a Mini Cooper Hardtop or Ford Fiesta, the 500 makes up for its lack of rear-seat room with its playful attitude, lengthy list of features and wide model range that includes the performance-oriented Abarth and all-electric 500e. Better still, the 500’s detailed design both inside and out doesn’t equate to an exorbitant price tag, making us question why more car companies don’t follow suit.

These figures can quickly escalate with options (most paint colors, for example, add $550 alone). The track-ready M4 Coupe starts at over $66,000, while an M4 hardtop convertible starts over $75,000. Load up these M editions, and you could be looking at $80,000-plus. The 2016 BMW 4 Series starts slightly higher than the Audi A5, but its base engine has more horsepower. The 4 Series starts several thousand above the Cadillac ATS Coupe, which also offers more standard horsepower, as well as the Lexus RC coupe. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their 4 Series. In the long run, the 4 Series’ resale value is expected to be average, lagging that of the Lexus RC.
Driving the Used 2016 BMW 4 SeriesThe BMW 4 Series takes the agility, acceleration and balance of the 3 Series and goes one better. With a wider stance and lower center of gravity, 2-door versions of the 4 Series are the perfect partner if you enjoy throwing your car into a corner. Trade-offs are increased road noise and a stiff ride on rough pavement. The Gran Coupe excels at grand touring thanks to its lively yet smooth road manners and extra cargo capacity. Base 428i models employ BMW’s excellent 240-horsepower 4-cylinder engine to power the rear or all four wheels. Though it’s turbocharged, not a hint of lag is felt. The 435i models use a 300-horsepower 6-cylinder that can propel AWD models to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. Transmission choices – an 8-speed automatic or 6-speed manual in 428i and 435i coupes – are exceptional. Packing 425 horsepower, the BMW M4 can hit 60 mph in about four seconds.
Interior ComfortThe 4-passenger cabin of the 4 Series coupe and convertible is comfortable for those in front, merely adequate for those in back. BMW has long shaped its cabins around the driver, and that remains true here. Controls are within easy reach, and the iDrive dial control system is simpler than past iterations. Though the Gran Coupe’s exterior footprint is the same as 2-door models, this 4-door has better rear-passenger access and over 45 cubic feet of cargo space with rear seats folded. It has a 3-person rear seat, but the humped center position isn’t very comfortable.
Exterior StylingCompared to its sedan sibling, the coupe and convertible are slightly larger and lower, with headlights that flow into the ""twin-kidney"" grille. With its additional two rear doors and sweptback roof, the 4 Series Gran Coupe looks like a smaller version of the svelte 6 Series Gran Coupe. Instead of a trunk door, it has a power tailgate that opens high for easy loading. The 4 Series convertible has a hardtop that offers better insulation and security than a fabric top. M4 performance models look meaner with larger front air intakes, power-dome hood and quad exhaust outlets.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINEThe base engine in the 4 Series is so good that it leaves little reason to pay thousands more for the 6-cylinder variant. Beyond its impressive specs – 240 horsepower, 255 lb-ft of torque, up to 35 mpg on the highway – is its immediate responsiveness.
FOLDING HARDTOP If you’re torn between the classic shape of the coupe and open-air excitement of a drop-top, the 4 Series convertible offers the best of both worlds with its power-operated retractable hardtop. Raised, it has similar lines and the security of a fixed-roof coupe. Folded it’s ready to soak up the sun.
Standard FeaturesEven if you spend the least on a base BMW 428i, you’ll get an excellent-driving vehicle with power front seats, 8-speed automatic (a 6-speed manual transmission is a no-cost option on the coupe), xenon adaptive headlights, a moonroof, dynamic cruise control, and automatic climate control. Infotainment includes a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio system with USB audio input, Bluetooth streaming and 6.5-inch display (unfortunately, a rearview camera still costs extra). Higher-end 435i models include a more powerful 6-cylinder engine and 18-inch wheels. The 2016 M4 features performance-oriented brakes and differential, while the Gran Coupe adds a handy power tailgate.
Factory OptionsFrom blind-spot monitoring to a 16-speaker/600-watt harman/kardon sound system, there are myriad ways to upgrade the 2016 4 Series. Most major offerings are bundled into packages. Prominent ones include the Premium Package that features hands-free trunk opening (you use a foot gesture) and replaces the SensaTec faux leather upholstery with the real thing, and the Technology Package that includes navigation and dedicated apps. A Driver Assistance package adds the blind-spot monitoring and Active Driving Assistant with lane-departure warning, collision-mitigation automatic braking and pedestrian detection. M4 models can bolster their performance potential with carbon-ceramic brakes and driver-selectable Adaptive M Suspension.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2016 BMW 4 Series is available in three potencies: 428i with a 240-horsepower 4-cylinder, 435i with a 300-horsepower 6-cylinder, and the M4 coupe and cabriolet with a 6-cylinder that churns out 425 horsepower. RWD is the standard layout, and all models except the M versions can be had with AWD, designated by an ""x"" in the model name, for enhanced traction. Most 4 Series models come with a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. A 6-speed manual transmission is available in 428i and 435i coupes, as well as the M4 coupe and convertible. The 428i and 435i models have start/stop technology that shuts off the engine at idle to save gas. Restarts tend to be jarring, but the feature can be disabled.

Now two years into its life, the 2016 BMW 4 Series is the designation for models formerly known as the 3 Series coupe and convertible. The nomenclature distinguishes the 2-door 4 Series from the growing variety of 4-door 3 Series models, but even the 4 Series’ lineup has grown with last year’s introduction of the Gran Coupe, a sleek 4-door hatch. Whatever the form, the BMW 4 Series offers excellent driving manners and a variety of powertrains ranging from an eager yet efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder to the 425-horsepower 6-cylinder in the M4, as well as rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive configurations. Like the Audi A5, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Lexus RC, the 4 Series blends performance and refinement to go with its"

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. The starter and alternator functions are combined into one unit, and the engine is equipped with an Auto Stop/Start feature. The hybrid can travel on pure electric power for short distances at speeds below 25 mph.

Using the same 2.0-liter engine only with slightly higher compression and an electric motor assist, the XV Crosstrek Hybrid delivers 12 additional horsepower and 18 more lb-ft of torque, plus an additional 4 mpg in city driving. Models equipped with navigation now feature the Aha infotainment app.
If there is one thing Subaru owners love about their vehicles it is ground clearance. So, when Subaru decided to make a new SUV from its popular Impreza hatchback, they started by raising it to a whopping 8.7 inches. Toss in a little cladding, some cool colors and snappy rims, and you’ve got the 2014 XV Crosstrek. Although not terribly powerful, the XV Crosstrek is easy on your fuel budget, and it can go places most of its rivals can’t. Priced around"

In addition to style, practicality, performance, technology and value, the two hybrid models appeal to green-driving enthusiasts.","ConsThere are two things that might keep you out of a 2016 Fusion. The first is the lack of a V6 engine, and although the Fusion’s 2.0-liter EcoBoost offers V6 levels of power, it’s not as smooth or refined as a V6. Diesel fans will also have to look elsewhere.",23000,"Driving the Used 2016 Ford FusionFor a family sedan, the 2016 Ford Fusion is surprisingly fun to drive in either front- or all-wheel-drive (FWD, AWD) forms. Even when saddled with the pokey 2.5-liter base 4-cylinder engine, the suspension setup offers unexpectedly good handling for such a large family sedan. The 1.5-liter 4-cylinder offers more thrust along with better fuel economy, but if you’re really looking for power, the 240-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo will satisfy all but the most ardent V6 fans. On the other hand, if you live your life by big mpg numbers instead of low quarter-mile times, the Fusion Hybrid seamlessly switches between gasoline and electric operation, and even goes up to 62 mph on electric power. The Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid gets up to 21 miles of EV range, with a total range of up to 620 miles.
Interior ComfortThe biggest change to the 2016 Ford Fusion is the easy-to-use buttons that replace the fiddly touch-sensitive pads on the center console. Otherwise, the roomy 5-passenger cabin mostly carries over. It doesn’t feel particularly airy, but it’s roomy enough for four adults, and three kids can fit in back without ""He’s on my side!"" arguments. The trunk swallows more cargo than a Honda Accord can, but the battery pack on hybrid and especially plug-in hybrid models compromises luggage space. This family sedan’s rear seats fold to expand cargo space, even in Hybrid models, but there’s no seatback release in the trunk.
Exterior StylingWith a grille cribbed from Aston Martin and a sleek profile, a new Ford Fusion would look right at home among several luxury sedans. The aggressive headlights and thin taillights are complemented by a variety of unique wheel designs and an interesting color palette. On a practical note, the clever EasyFuel capless gas-filler system means you’ll never again lose your fuel cap, or have to wrestle it open or closed. Fusion Energi models use a lighted ring around the charge port, with a fully lit ring meaning charging’s complete.
Favorite FeaturesPLUG-IN HYBRID VERSIONWith up to 21 miles on a charge, the 2016 Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid could go for weeks without refueling. However, the gasoline engine has its back, allowing up to five folks to travel 620 miles on a road trip before refueling.
SMALL BUT EFFICIENT ENGINESThe Ford Fusion offers a 4-cylinder engine in every model, including the hybrids. As long as you concentrate on the ""Eco"" instead of the ""Boost"" in the EcoBoost turbos, you can see very good fuel economy, regardless of what you pick.
Standard FeaturesYou don’t have to spend a lot to get a decently equipped 2016 Ford Fusion, with base Fusion S models coming standard with manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary input, 16-inch wheels, and Ford’s SYNC wireless communication system with voice control. SE models add a 10-way-power driver’s seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system and 17-inch wheels. The top-line Titanium model gets the powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, a premium 12-speaker Sony audio system with HD and satellite radio, dual-zone auto climate control, a rearview camera, leather seating and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsIn addition to drivetrain choices, you can add a lot of high-tech safety to a new Ford Fusion. Blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning help expand driver awareness, and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. The reverse-sensing system helps in parking lots, and the Active Park Assist system takes it even further, actually parallel-parking the car for you. SE and Titanium models can also be equipped with all-wheel drive, making the Fusion one of the few family sedans to offer that added layer of foul-weather security in Snowbelt states.
Engine & TransmissionJust skip the base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the 2016 Ford Fusion. Instead, start at the SE sedan, where you can choose between 1.5-liter or 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, both of which can run on regular gasoline. The 1.5-liter offers start/stop technology that shuts off the engine at a stop to save fuel. The Fusion Hybrid and Energi plug-in hybrid use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission for excellent fuel economy. The Energi has up to 21 miles of EV range, with up to 620 miles total range, recharging in about 2.5 hours on a 240-volt outlet. Note that the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder, along with its available manual transmission, is gone for 2016.

Driving the Used 2016 Toyota Tacoma Access CabYou need to have a clear idea about what you want in a midsize-pickup truck before choosing a used 2016 Tacoma.
If serious off-roading is in your future, you’ll want the TRD Off-Road with 4WD and an automatic transmission. If not, then a TRD Sport makes sense. Leather and several other features are exclusive to the Limited trim, while the SR is best for work instead of play. The Tacoma SR5 offers a good blend of value and equipment.
For this review, we drove two versions of the Tacoma. One was a TRD Off-Road and the other was a Limited, both in Double Cab 4WD specification with the new 3.5-liter V6 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission and 4WD.
How fast is the 2016 Toyota Tacoma? In spite of its more powerful V6 engine, the 2016 Tacoma isn’t particularly fast. Nail the gas pedal to the floor, and it bellows with authority while delivering satisfactory acceleration. In most driving situations, though, the V6 delivers steady performance.
Neither is this powertrain refined when it comes to noise and vibration, but then again, this is a truck designed first for work, second for play, and third for just about anything except coddling its occupants.
In an apparent effort to conserve fuel, the new 6-speed automatic transmission is usually in a hurry to upshift and tends to resist downshifts. However, it faithfully holds a lower gear when driving in the mountains to help power up grades and to use engine braking when descending a hill.
Does the 2016 Toyota Tacoma get good gas mileage? Rated to get 21 mpg in combined driving, the most efficient version of the 2016 Tacoma has the V6 engine, automatic transmission and 2WD. While the 4-cylinder engine also earns a 21-mpg combined rating, its highway average is lower than the V6 engine’s rating.
This combined average matches the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon V6, but the Chevy and GMC 4-cylinder models are slightly more efficient. And, in 2016, the reigning fuel-economy champs in the midsize-pickup-truck segment were the Colorado and Canyon equipped with a 2.8-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine. They average 23-25 mpg in combined driving.
During our testing, the Double Cab TRD Off-Road V6 4WD averaged 19.1 mpg, falling a bit short of the EPA’s rating of 20 mpg. The Double Cab Limited V6 4WD landed in that same neighborhood, averaging 18.9 mpg. How does the 2016 Toyota Tacoma handle? The answer to this question depends on where you drive a Tacoma. In the dirt, especially with TRD Off-Road trim and equipment, the Tacoma is a natural, giving its driver boundless confidence in the face of worsening trail or weather conditions. On pavement, the Tacoma is less pleasing to drive. Slow and vague steering, front-disc/rear-drum brakes that are hard to modulate, and tall tire sidewalls mean it is wise to keep speeds in check. How does the 2016 Toyota Tacoma ride on the highway?Though equipped with a frame making use of high-strength steel, the Tacoma wiggles and jiggles its way across imperfect pavement. Rather than smoothing them out, this truck amplifies potholes and bumps. Basically, it rides like a truck, and in every configuration.
How does the 2016 Toyota Tacoma perform off-road? The Tacoma, especially in TRD Off-Road specification, excels off-road. With 9.4 inches of ground clearance, Kevlar-reinforced all-terrain tires, Multi-Terrain Select driving modes, and Crawl Control technology, the Tacoma TRD Off-Road is a 4-wheeling rock star. Unfortunately, the truck’s long and flat hood obscures visibility, forcing regular stops for visual checks on tougher trails. Are the 2016 Toyota Tacoma’s driving-assistance systems helpful? Equipped with no more than a rearview camera, the 2016 Tacoma is refreshingly simple. The single upgrade is a blind-spot-monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert system, one of the most helpful driving-assistance technology innovations of the past decade. It came only with TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, and Limited trim levels. Is the 2016 Toyota Tacoma fun to drive? Take a 2016 Tacoma off pavement, and you’re virtually assured to have a blast. Especially in TRD Off-Road specification, the Tacoma is lots of fun. On pavement, the Tacoma is not fun to drive — unless you enjoy the rough, unrefined behavior that comes with tough, truck-spec underpinnings. A busy ride, limited handling capability, and often sleepy powertrain responsiveness can make the Tacoma a chore to drive on a daily basis.
Interior ComfortAvailable in Access Cab and Double Cab styles, every Tacoma is designed to seat a minimum of four people. Rear passengers will be happier in the Double Cab, though, which has a full, 3-passenger rear bench seat instead of the Access Cab’s occasional-use jump seats.
Tacomas sit quite high off the ground, but must remain short enough to easily garage, so the cabin is squat in terms of height, and broad in terms of width. For 2016, Toyota redesigned the Tacoma’s interior, installing a sporty yet utilitarian dashboard with stylish round vents, a touch-screen infotainment system, and a mix of knobs and buttons logically arranged in neat, tidy rows.
Does the 2016 Toyota Tacoma have a nice interior? The answer to this question depends on your definition of “nice,” and which trim level you’re talking about.
Designed to withstand indifference and abuse, the Tacoma is loaded with hard plastic materials. In fact, in most trims, it appears ready to hose out after an adventure. From that standpoint, no, the interior is not nice.
Several Tacomas have silver dashboard accents along with a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear-selector knob. These upgrades help, and the Limited trim adds Hickory brown perforated leather for the seats and color-matched simulated leather on the dashboard. That’s about as nice as a Tacoma’s cabin gets.
From a design standpoint, yes, the Tacoma has a nice interior. Emphasizing function but with a layer of stylish form, the simple symmetry of the air vents and gauges, and the tidy rows of controls on the dashboard, impart elegant attention to design detail. The steering wheel is, however, oddly oversized.
What 2016 Toyota Tacoma interior colors are available? Toyota offered the 2016 Tacoma’s interior in just a few colors. Cement Gray fabric was the only choice for the base SR trim. Moving up to SR5 trim featured Black cloth in addition to Cement Gray, while the TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road replaced Cement Gray with Graphite. Every Limited came exclusively with Hickory brown leather.
Are the 2016 Toyota Tacoma’s controls easy to use? Often, truck owners wear gloves. Toyota appears to understand this, because aside from its rather small 6.1-inch touch-screen display infotainment system, the Tacoma’s buttons and knobs are large, clearly marked, and for the most part, logically located.
Is the 2016 Toyota Tacoma’s infotainment system easy to use? If the Tacoma’s buttons, knobs, and switches are easy to use, even when you’re wearing gloves, the touch-screen infotainment system is not.
Three versions of the Entune infotainment systems are available. The standard setup has a 6.1-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, a USB 2.0 port, Siri Eyes Free, and a rearview camera. The mid-level version adds satellite radio and a Scout GPS-connected navigation app that works through your smartphone and data plan, showing directions on the display screen. The top version has a larger 7-inch display, a flush-mounted glass surface, an embedded navigation system, and Entune App Suite. A JBL premium sound system is optional for TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road, and standard with Limited trim.
Both test trucks included the top-tier system. With its flush display screen, gloss-black stereo volume and tuning knobs, and touch-sensing main menu buttons flanking the screen, it certainly looks modern. The user experience, however, leaves something to be desired.
For example, the volume and tuning knobs don’t stick out far enough from the surface, making them hard to twist. Even without gloves on, they can be difficult to grasp. The on-screen virtual buttons are even harder to use because the Tacoma doesn’t have a smooth ride, so stabbing at the screen with any expectation of accuracy is often an exercise in futility.
Pairing to the Bluetooth is easy, and the voice recognition system is intuitive as long as you stick to the pre-programmed script. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not included with any version of the Tacoma’s infotainment systems.
Is the 2016 Toyota Tacoma comfortable? Each of the Tacoma’s front seats offers 4-way adjustment. You can move them forward and back, and you can recline the seat angle. That’s it.
Because neither front seat is adjustable for height, you sit low in this truck, close to the floor. And because you can’t tilt the bottom of the seat cushion to add thigh support, it’s easy to adopt a slouched, splay-legged driving position.
The benefit here is that when you enter or exit the high-riding Tacoma, it’s fairly easy to just slide into and out of the cab. And, once you’re inside, there is plenty of headroom for taller people.
The back seat sits up higher, almost stadium-style in relationship to the front seats. This restricts headroom, though, and since there isn’t much legroom in the first place most adults won’t want to ride in the back of a Double Cab for long. And forget about putting grown-ups into the Access Cab.
Is the 2016 Toyota Tacoma’s cargo bed useful? Yes, and while it’s deeper than previous Tacomas, it still isn’t as accommodating as what you’ll find on a Chevrolet Colorado or GMC Canyon.
All 2016 Tacomas have a composite-lined cargo bed with storage areas, and the TRD and Limited versions include a handy 120-volt/400-watt power outlet in the right sidewall of the bed. The locking tailgate lowers slowly instead of slamming down, and a 3-piece hard tonneau cover was available as an option.
What else should I know about the 2016 Toyota Tacoma? There is a decent amount of storage inside the Tacoma’s cab. Both the center console box and glove box offer plenty of room, and in addition to six cup holders the Tacoma has a sizable tray on the center console. The Tacoma Double Cab also supplies storage underneath the seat, and if you fold the seat down you have plenty of locking in-cab space.
Exterior StylingWith a long and flat hood, a bold hexagonal grille that takes on a different appearance depending on the trim level, boxy fender flares, available over-fender trim, and chiseled lower character lines, the 2016 Toyota Tacoma looks like nothing but a truck. Which is as it should be.
As expected, the Tacoma is basic in SR trim, but most include a body-color front bumper to improve the truck’s appearance. Stepping up to SR5 trim adds some chrome-coated bling and fog lights, and Tacomas with the optional Appearance Packages have over-fender trim and aluminum wheels.
Tacoma TRD Sport and Off-Road models are easy to identify, mainly because they have decals on the cargo bed denoting them as such. The TRD Sport has a hood scoop, while the TRD Off-Road has a reworked front bumper that gives the truck a better approach angle for superior off-roading capability. Both have bright and shiny grilles.
Get a Tacoma Limited, and the truck features a unique blend of chrome and body-color trim, combined with handsome 18-inch polished aluminum wheels and a tasteful gray grille.
What 2016 Toyota Tacoma colors are available? The redesigned 2016 Tacoma came in eight colors, three of which were new to the truck. They are listed below, with the new colors duly noted:
Super WhiteSilverMagnetic GrayBlackBarcelona RedQuicksand (New)Inferno (New)Blazing Blue Pearl (New)
Favorite FeaturesINTEGRATED GOPRO WINDSHIELD MOUNTYou know a truck is built for adventure when every version of it includes a factory-installed GoPro mount on the windshield. Whether you simply want to record other drivers during the daily commute, or you want to capture the fun you’re having on the weekends, the Tacoma is ready. Oh, the places you’ll go!
CLUTCH-START CANCELEquip a Tacoma with 4WD and a manual transmission, and it comes with a clutch-start cancel system. This is helpful off-road when you need to get the Tacoma moving without rolling back or spinning the wheels. Push a button on the lower left side of the dashboard, and you can start the truck without depressing the clutch. As the engine starts, it puts power to all four wheels and you just need to press on the accelerator to keep the Tacoma moving.
ACTIVE TRACTION CONTROLTacoma TRD Off-Road models with a manual transmission include Active Traction Control (A-TRAC) as standard equipment. Once the driver activates the system using a button on the lower left side of the dashboard, A-TRAC detects wheelspin and actively distributes torque from the wheels that are slipping to the wheels that are gripping.
MULTI-TERRAIN SELECTStandard with any Tacoma TRD Off-Road equipped with 4WD and an automatic transmission, this technology provides an electronically controlled locking rear differential and five driving modes for different types of terrain. They are: Mud and Sand, Mogul, Rock and Dirt, Loose Rock, and Rock. These driving modes automatically adjust throttle response, wheelspin and brake pressure to keep the Tacoma moving across challenging terrain.
CRAWL CONTROLCrawl Control operates like cruise control, but at ultra-low speeds. It works between 1 mph and 5 mph, managing acceleration and braking to maintain the set speed as the Tacoma crawls up and down difficult hills. This frees the driver to focus on steering the truck and putting the Tacoma on the best path forward. It is included on Tacoma TRD Off-Road models with 4WD and an automatic transmission.
Standard FeaturesFor 2016, the Tacoma came in basic SR, popular SR5, sporty TRD Sport, rugged TRD Off-Road, and upscale Limited trim levels. Below, you’ll find the major differences between each of them.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Tacoma SR? Built for work before play, the Tacoma SR is a basic midsize-pickup truck available in Access Cab and Double Cab styles. Highlights include air conditioning, power exterior mirrors, power windows and power door locks. A touch-screen infotainment system with a 6.1-inch display is standard, and it comes with a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Siri Eyes Free, and a USB 2.0 data port. Oh, and it has an integrated GoPro camera mount on the windshield, right from the factory.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Tacoma SR5? The Tacoma SR5 is a popular version of this truck for its blend of value and configurability. Standard equipment includes cruise control, remote keyless entry, a trip computer, satellite radio and a Scout GPS-connected navigation system. A leather-wrapped steering wheel classes up the joint, along with chrome grille and rear-bumper trim and a set of fog lights.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport? You can tell the Tacoma TRD Sport apart from the rest of the lineup by its hood scoop. The TRD Sport also gets 17-inch aluminum wheels, chubby over-fender trim pieces, and an infotainment system with a larger 7-inch display screen, an embedded navigation system, HD Radio, HD traffic and weather data, and Toyota’s Entune App Suite technology. Wireless smartphone charging is also on board, along with a handy 120-volt/400-watt AC power outlet in the cargo bed.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road? The Tacoma TRD Off-Road is just like the TRD Sport but with features that make it more adept off pavement. Smaller 16-inch aluminum wheels wrapped in Kevlar-reinforced tires and unique exterior styling elements identify this model, and if you get the manual transmission it includes an Active Traction Control system. Choose 4WD and the automatic, and the TRD Off-Road includes an electronic locking differential, a Multi-terrain Select traction system, and Crawl Control, which works like cruise control for off-roading. Off-road suspension tuning is also standard.
What comes in the 2016 Toyota Tacoma Limited? Remove the TRD Sport’s hood scoop, add chrome exterior trim, bolt on a set of polished 18-inch aluminum wheels, and you have the foundation for the Tacoma Limited. Intended to serve the role of the upscale Tacoma, the Limited has leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power sunroof, and a JBL premium sound system. Other upgrades include rear parking-assist sensors and a blind-spot-monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert.
Factory OptionsToyota grouped most Tacoma options into packages, which are summarized below. Additionally, dealerships offered a wide range of extra-cost accessories for this truck, installed on-site by the retailer.
SR Utility Package Available only for the Access Cab with a 4-cylinder engine, this option transforms a Tacoma into a true work truck. It strips out the back seat and rear cup holders, and it adds black exterior door handles, black mirror caps, and a black rear-bumper finish. The rear window is fixed rather than a slider.
SR Convenience Package Going in the other direction, this option makes the basic Tacoma SR more livable with cruise control and remote keyless entry.
SR5 Appearance Package Toyota offered multiple SR5 Appearance Packages for the 2016 Tacoma. They all had aluminum wheels and over-fender trim. Additional extras could include rear parking-assist sensors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, an embedded navigation system, and Entune App Suite.
TRD Premium & Technology Package This option upgraded the TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road with dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, automatic headlights, rear parking-assist sensors, and a blind-spot-monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert. For Double Cab models, this package also installed a power sunroof.
V6 Tow Package This package prepped a Tacoma V6 for towing with a Class IV tow hitch receiver, 4- and 7-pin connectors, 130-amp alternator, transmission-oil cooler, and trailer-sway control.
Engine & TransmissionStandard with SR and SR5 trim, the Tacoma’s direct-injected 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine makes 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic, and it comes with 2WD or 4WD drivetrains. This engine is neither powerful nor fuel-efficient. Instead, it’s cheap. Notably, it’s also installed in the version of the Tacoma that can carry the heaviest payload: the Access Cab 2WD.

It’s standard with TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, and Limited trim, and optional for SR and SR5 versions of the truck. The V6 is available with a manual or an automatic transmission, and with 2WD or 4WD.

Redesigned for 2016
Stiffer frame with retuned suspension
New V6 engine & 6-speed transmissions
Serious off-road hardware & software
Improved towing capacity
Updated infotainment systems

Toyota redesigned the Tacoma for the 2016 model year. With a more rigid frame and a new V6 powertrain, the Tacoma was more powerful, more fuel-efficient, and more capable than ever. No doubt, these upgrades, combined with interior refinements, new infotainment systems, and a handful of driving-assistance technologies, helped to ensure the Tacoma retained its decade-long status as the best-selling midsize truck in America.
When shopping for a used Toyota Tacoma, you’ll find the truck in extended cab (Access Cab) and crew cab (Double Cab) styles. Trim levels include SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, and Limited. Depending on trim level and cab style, the Tacoma is equipped with a 4-cylinder or a V6 engine, 2WD or 4WD, and a manual or an automatic transmission.
When it was new, the Tacoma’s primary competitors were the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, which offered similar levels of equipment and capability. The Nissan Frontier, a rugged truck in its own right, is a comparative bargain but by 2016 was a decade-old design.
Used 2016 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab PricingToyota sold the 2016 Tacoma in about 30 different combinations of cab style, bed size, trim level, engine choice, and driveline type.

Driving the Used 2016 Honda AccordFor the most part, Honda doesn’t tout itself as a purveyor of enthusiast-tuned vehicles, but most of the company’s cars and SUVs are rewarding to drive.
The fun starts with smooth and peppy engines tuned for eager response and delivering uncanny refinement. Taut but not stiff suspension tuning, precise steering, and effective brakes make the 2016 Accord enjoyable, and this year’s structural improvements and revised dynamic tuning help to put an even bigger smile on a driver’s face.
You’ll buy the Accord for its reliability, value and practicality. Driving enjoyment is the icing on the cake.
How fast is the 2016 Honda Accord? Get the standard 4-cylinder engine and the CVT, and you might be surprised by the Accord’s strong acceleration. Even with four people aboard, we find the Accord’s 4-cylinder capable of effortless freeway merges and speedy slow-vehicle passes. This powertrain also delivers impressive fuel economy in daily driving situations.
Of course, the available V6 engine provides abundant power, but at a cost to fuel economy. Out in the real world instead of the EPA’s prescribed testing regimen, the penalty isn’t as significant as you might guess, though, because the V6 doesn’t need to work as hard as the 4-cylinder to motivate the Accord’s mass. It also includes a cylinder-deactivation system that makes the V6 especially efficient on the highway.
Does the 2016 Honda Accord get good gas mileage? Depending on the engine and transmission combination, the Accord is EPA-rated to return between 21 mpg and 30 mpg in combined driving.
As you might expect, the 4-cylinder/CVT is the most efficient powertrain combination. In the Sport trim with paddle shifters, it should return 29 mpg. Otherwise, this combination gets 30 mpg. Insist on shifting for yourself, and the Accord 4-cylinder gets 27 mpg.
The V6 with a stick returns 21 mpg. Go with the automatic, and the Accord travels 24 to 25 miles on every gallon of gas, depending on the presence of paddle shifters. This aligns with our testing, during which an Accord Touring sedan averaged between those numbers. How does the 2016 Honda Accord handle? Thanks to its structural upgrades, the 2016 Accord boasts newfound solidity and quietude on the road, and the 19-inch wheels on Sport and Touring versions supply plenty of grip. You can toss one of these Accords around like a sports sedan if you want to. And Honda appears to expect this behavior, installing larger front brakes on Sport and Touring models for 2016.
 How does the 2016 Honda Accord ride on the highway?","What's New?
Updated styling with available 19-inch wheels
Structural, steering, braking & suspension improvements
Available Honda Sensing driving-assistance & collision-avoidance technologies
New infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto & HondaLink Assist (EX & higher)
Touring coupe is new; Touring sedan gains parking sensors, rain-sensing wipers, heated rear seats
Hybrid sedan goes on hiatus until 2017

We’re big fans of the Honda Accord, and the changes for 2016 make a great car that much better.
Available in 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan body styles, the Accord is like a faithful friend: reliable, steadfast, and there when you need it. Every version delivers exceptional value without sacrificing style, features or performance. And while the Accord holds its value well, making it more expensive than other midsize cars as a used vehicle, it will still be worth something when the time comes to hand it over to the next owner.
When shopping for a used Honda Accord, you’ll find the coupe in LX-S, EX, EX-L and Touring trim levels. All but the Touring, which has a standard V6 engine and handsome 19-inch aluminum wheels, come with a 4-cylinder engine. The 4-cylinder is paired with a manual gearbox or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with paddle shifters. The V6 comes with a manual or an automatic transmission, and is available as an option with EX-L trim.
Switching to the 2016 Accord sedan, the different versions are called LX, Sport, EX, EX-L and Touring. The Touring trim includes the V6 engine and automatic transmission, while the others feature a 4-cylinder engine paired with a manual transmission or a CVT (with paddle shifters in Sport trim). The V6 and automatic are optional for the EX-L sedan.
If you want a midsize coupe, the Accord is your only option from the 2016 model year — unless you cross-shop it with a 2016 Dodge Challenger or a luxury-brand alternative such as the 2016 Audi A5 or 2016 BMW 4 Series.
In the midsize-sedan category, there are several alternatives to the Accord. They include the KBB Best Buy winner of that model year, the 2016 Kia Optima, as well as finalists like the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu, 2016 Hyundai Sonata, 2016 Mazda Mazda6 and 2016 Toyota Camry.

Fiat’s Italian styling philosophy has clearly influenced this particular Cherokee, which is also rather pricey and not terribly powerful with its standard engine.",24000,"Driving the Used 2016 Jeep CherokeeThe Jeep Cherokee SUV for 2016 is offered in five variations: Sport, Latitude, Altitude, Limited and Trailhawk. All but the Trailhawk come standard with front-wheel drive (FWD); 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optional. The Cherokee competes well with the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. However, the Cherokee’s 4-cylinder engine isn’t as smooth or refined as the Honda’s, nor is it as fuel-efficient. Fuel economy notwithstanding, the optional V6 is the best engine for on-road acceleration and off-road exploration. Along with the three available 4WD options is the Selec-Terrain system that allows for optimal off-road traction. Drivers can choose settings for Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and Rock. Or, one can simply set the knob to “Auto” and let the Cherokee select the best mode. All Cherokees are endowed with generous approach and departure angles and good ground clearance, while the Trailhawk maximizes the Cherokee’s off-road potential.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Jeep Cherokee SUV interior blends traditional Jeep cues – such as the trapezoidal ""center stack"" – with modern touches to create an attractive and upscale layout. The seats offer good support and come trimmed in either attractive cloth or soft Nappa leather. The heated and ventilated top-of-the-line seats also come with power adjustments and memory. The 2nd-row seats adjust forward and backward for better legroom, and split 60/40 for maximum cargo flexibility. We were particularly fond of the available wireless-device charging pad, plus the enormous glove box. However, we do wish the Cherokee offered more room overall inside.
Exterior StylingPolarizing is the best way to sum up the Jeep Cherokee for 2016. It’s one thing to stray from the traditional Jeep design aesthetic of round headlights flanking a 7-slot grille, but quite another to ditch the appearance of headlights entirely. However, we’ve warmed up to the newest Jeep Cherokee, and there’s a lot here that says “Jeep.” The 7-slot grille has a ""kink"" folding it into the hood, and the less controversial rear resembles the Grand Cherokee SUV. Trailhawk versions kick up the macho with a higher ride, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear treatments.
Favorite Features9-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONGerman transmission specialist ZF created a 9-speed automatic for the Cherokee that not only improves performance and fuel economy it works without a glitch, giving the potent V6 engine highway fuel economy as good as some 4-cylinder competitors. 
SELEC-TERRAINThe secret to the 2016 Jeep Cherokee’s off-road prowess is hidden in its Selec-Terrain system. Utilizing 12 different vehicle systems including the stability, brake, drivetrain, powertrain and transmission controllers, the Cherokee ensures maximum traction in all situations.
Standard FeaturesAll Jeep Cherokee SUVs come standard with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, offering very good fuel economy and a range of about 500 miles on a tank of gasoline. Other standard equipment includes a Uconnect 5-inch touch-screen media center that includes Bluetooth, USB, SD and auxiliary ports. Also standard are a 3.5-inch full-color center display, 10 air bags, electronic stability control, traction control, Hill-start Assist, electric power steering, and an electric parking brake, plus cruise control, air conditioning with rear outlets, and remote keyless entry. The Jeep Cargo Management system includes standard hooks and a storage tote.
Factory OptionsJeep Cherokee Latitude, Altitude, Limited and Trailhawk models can get the 3.2-liter Pentastar V6 engine. There are three 4WD systems available as well: Active Drive I, Active Drive II and, on Trailhawk models, Active Drive Lock. Other upgrades include an 8.4-inch touch screen for Uconnect, an Alpine premium audio with nine speakers and a subwoofer, and a CommandView dual-pane panoramic sunroof with power sunshade. Cherokee Limited models add leather, heated power seats and steering wheel, Keyless Enter-N-Go, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Trailhawk models emphasize off-road capabilities with skidplates, an increased ride height and a more rugged look.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine for all 2016 Jeep Cherokee models is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine offering 184 horsepower. However, unlike many of its competitors, Jeep offers a V6 engine in its small SUV as well: a 3.2-liter V6 with 271 horsepower, and the added ability to tow up to 4,500 pounds. Both engines offer good fuel economy, with the 4-cylinder obviously being the fuel-sipper’s choice. Both engines come with a 9-speed automatic transmission, whether equipped with front-drive or 4WD. Three different 4WD systems are available, ranging from the Jeep Active Drive I and Jeep Active Drive II, to the aggressive Jeep Active Drive Lock reserved for the off-road-ready Trailhawk. V6 models get a modest fuel economy bump thanks to the standard start-stop mechanism.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2016, the Jeep Cherokee compact-crossover SUV sees improvements in driver comfort with revisions to the front seats, steering-column position and instrument cluster. The 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen option gains a Drag and Drop Menu Bar, Siri Eyes Free and a Do Not Disturb setting.
Unlike the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, the 2016 Jeep Cherokee crossover SUV boasts genuine off-road credentials worthy of the Jeep name. Even in its most formidable trim level – that being the rugged Trailhawk – the Cherokee surrenders nothing in the way of comfort or handling. When the need arises, however, the Cherokee’s low-range mode and three different 4-wheel-drive systems permit everything from light off-roading to rock crawling through passes unnavigable by most Cherokee rivals. Yet, for all its rough and tough bravado, the Cherokee’s interior is a luxurious oasis of modern design and technology. Toss in the available V6 engine and standard 9-speed transmission, and you get a compact-crossover SUV unlike any other in the segment.

If you rejected the Ford Explorer for any of those reasons, maybe it’s time for another look.","ConsWhile the new front-view camera and front parking sensors surely help maneuvering in parking lots, there’s no question that the new Ford Explorer is still a big beast, and could be unwieldy. Another drawback: While the Terrain Management System is good, it can’t match something like a Jeep Grand Cherokee.",31500,"Driving the Used 2016 Ford ExplorerTwo engines are carryover for the 2016 Ford Explorer: the standard 3.5-liter V6 continues, offering 290 horsepower with either front-wheel drive (FWD) or 4-wheel drive (AWD), and routing it through the 6-speed automatic transmission that’s the only choice for all Explorer buyers. If you want real oomph, then the Explorer Sport and new Explorer Platinum offer a twin-turbocharged version of the V6 with 365 horsepower. However, the new 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine that’s available in base, XLT and Limited models caught our attention. Ford says it will offer the same fuel economy as last year’s 2.0-liter version, but with 270 horsepower, it’s nearly as powerful as the standard V6 and should have no problem hauling this big SUV around.
Interior ComfortThe Ford Explorer seats up to seven in its three rows, and thanks to its overall size even the third row offers room for adults. The second row comes as either a 3-person bench, or it can be had with two bucket seats. Fold both seating rows and you have generous cargo space. We’re happy that Ford has replaced the old Explorer’s touch-sensitive controls with actual buttons, and also like the looks of the new 10-inch digital screen integrated into the gauges. Other improvements are aimed at making the new Explorer friendlier to smaller drivers, such as repositioned armrests.
Exterior StylingThe changes to the new Ford Explorer don’t alter the basic silhouette of the SUV, but the details are quite nice. The new standard LED low-beam headlights, grille, and bumper in front give this mainstream SUV a first-glance resemblance to a Land Rover Range Rover, pretty good company we’d say, although the lower part of the bumper looks too heavy. We like the addition of a front-view camera on the Explorer, as well as front parking sensors, both handy when maneuvering through a parking lot. Changes to the rear are more subtle, and mostly consist of new taillights.
Favorite FeaturesBUTTONS It may sound odd to get excited over buttons, but we couldn’t be happier that Ford has abandoned its touch-sensitive control panel with one that uses regular ol’ buttons for climate controls and basic audio functions. We’re not luddites, but the old system smacked of being different just for difference’s sake. 
TERRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Once upon a time, SUVs were based off rugged 4-wheel-drive trucks. These days, they’re mostly based on unibody car platforms, which are less robust. The Ford Explorer’s Terrain Management System tries to bridge that gap by optimizing the Explorer’s 4-wheel-drive system for snow, mud, or ruts with the twist of a dial.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Explorer comes in five models: base, XLT, Limited, Sport, and a new Platinum model. Base models come standard with the 3.5-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic with steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters, LED low-beam headlights and LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, and a rearview camera that incorporates a washer to keep the lens clean. Other standard features include cruise control, air conditioning, a 6-speaker audio system, and Ford’s Sync. Ford’s MyKey, allows drivers to program top speed and other parameters to help prevent young drivers from behaving recklessly. Other safety features include trailer Sway Control for easier towing.
Factory OptionsAs is often the case these days, moving up through the model lineup is the best way to get more on your new Explorer. The mid-level XLT is a good value, offering leather seats, navigation, blind-spot detection, inflatable rear seatbelts, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a dual-panel moonroof. Base, XLT and Limited models can substitute the new 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder for the standard V6, and all-wheel drive is available across the board, regardless of engine. The new Platinum model comes with the twin-turbo EcoBoost V6, plus high-end leather, a premium audio system, leather-covered dash, and other luxury items.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 on the Ford Explorer is fine for most people, offering decent power and acceptable fuel economy. The new 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine makes a good argument for itself though. Despite being a little down on power compared to the V6, the EcoBoost four offers notably more torque, and can now be had with all-wheel drive. We expect this engine to be the choice for many buyers. Available on the Sport and Platinum models is the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, bumping power up to a more-than-adequate 365 horsepower. All new Ford Explorer models can be equipped with 4-wheel drive, a change from last year.

Read Full Review","What's New?Numerous changes greet the 2016 Ford Explorer, including new exterior styling, a new interior, improved control interface with hard buttons replacing the touch-sensitive targets from last year, and a new 2.3-liter turbocharged EcoBoost 4-cylinder with 270 horsepower. Last but not least, there’s a new luxurious model, the new Explorer Platinum.
The 2016 Explorer brings new looks, new technology, and new thinking to Ford’s ubiquitous midsize SUV. The refreshed exterior borrows from Land Rover’s styling, and the new interior brings more refinements and ease of use, especially for shorter buyers, or those put off by Ford’s touch-sensitive control interfaces and earlier versions of MyFord Touch. A new Explorer Platinum model offers luxury features like a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, leather-wrapped instrument panel, and ""Nirvana"" leather on the seats (no, it’s not embroidered with heart-shaped boxes). Not all the changes are at the top though. A new 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine offers more power and good fuel economy, and is now available with all-wheel drive. The Terrain Management System even gives this car-based crossover some off-road chops.

Better-equipped mid-level versions of the Journey such as the SXT and Crossroad are in the mid-$20,000 range, while a top-line R/T version with AWD reaches the mid-$30,000 level. At its base price, the Dodge Journey SE remains the lowest-priced midsize SUV, and even after climbing trims is a good value among midsize SUVs such as the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Mazda CX-9 and Kia Sorento. The Mitsubishi Outlander with seating for seven is also a value leader among 3-row SUVs, but is smaller than the Journey. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Journey SUV. In the years ahead, the Journey’s residual value is expected to be average, still lagging the Toyota Highlander.
Driving the Used 2016 Dodge JourneyThose accustomed to older, truck-based SUVs will be quite pleased with the way Dodge’s Journey crossover SUV for 2016 rides and drives. A unit body and advanced suspension setup help the Journey return car-like driving characteristics similar to a tall-riding station wagon, which is essentially what the Journey is. Confident on highway runs and surprisingly agile over narrow, twisting roads, the Journey is devoid of the bobbing and weaving one might experience in a truck-based SUV. Although we found the 173-horsepower 4-cylinder engine adequate with two people aboard, any additional bodies or cargo demands the Pentastar V6, which delivers an additional 100 horsepower and nearly the same fuel economy. We like the Journey’s upright seating position and found the front seats to be remarkably supportive and comfortable, even after driving long distances.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Dodge Journey’s cabin is available in a 2-row, 5-passenger layout or as a 3-row, 7-passenger configuration. Passenger space for adults is commendable up front and good in the second row, but legroom is very tight in the third row, which is best left for kids or occasional use. One of the best features of the Journey is its available Uconnect infotainment system. In addition to a large and easy-to-use 8.4-inch touch screen centered in the dash, there are supplementary buttons for climate and audio that are simple to see and use.
Exterior StylingIs it a sport-utility vehicle or the reincarnation of a station wagon? With the 2016 Journey from Dodge, its 192.4-inch length exceeds much of the competition, but Dodge’s designers have given it exterior treatments such as the chrome-trimmed cross-hair grille and eye-catching aluminum-alloy wheel choices that keep it from being merely bland. If a more stylish look is important, opt for the R/T version, with its 19-inch wheels, monochromatic treatment and distinctive R/T labels. For a tougher-looking version, there’s the Dodge Journey Crossroad, which features a faux skidplate, standard roof rails and blacked-out wheels.
Favorite FeaturesCARGO FLEXIBILITYDodge’s Journey SUV for 2016 has numerous clever storage ideas. Not only does the rear seat fold flush, there are additional storage bins beneath the 2nd-row floor and front-passenger seat cushion. The same seat can fold flat to better accommodate long items such as a surfboard and skis.
3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6 ENGINEDodge’s Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 engine is not only smooth and powerful, it also returns impressive fuel economy on par with the Journey’s smaller 4-cylinder engine.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Dodge Journey 7-passenger crossover SUV is available in a five trims, from the base SE to the top-line R/T. At its most basic, the 2016 Journey includes dual-zone climate control, 4.3-inch touch-screen media center, keyless entry and push-button start, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power windows and door locks. Entertainment is provided by a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with auxiliary and USB inputs, but no Bluetooth streaming as standard. Safety features include electronic traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes, front-seat side airbags and side-curtain airbags for all rows.
Factory OptionsPlenty of options can be had on the 2016 Journey. Among the more popular are 3-row seating (Flexible Seating Group), traction-enhancing all-wheel drive in lieu of the standard front-drive setup, an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect infotainment system and navigation. Amenities that bring an upscale feel include leather seating, Infinity speakers, rear-seat video entertainment system with 9-inch screen and two wireless headphones, in-car Wi-Fi hotspot, and heated front seats and heated steering wheel. A Driver Convenience Group adds a rearview camera and distance-alert function when in reverse, but more advanced safety functions like blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking are not available.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available for Dodge’s 2016 Journey crossover SUV. Standard on lower trims is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that makes an only-adequate 173 horsepower. The engine we recommend is the 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 that is optional on all but base Dodge Journeys and standard in higher trims. The V6 is also your only choice if you require all-wheel drive (AWD) instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD) to deal with inclement weather and slippery roads. Both engines run on regular unleaded gasoline. All Dodge Journeys use automatic transmissions, with the 4-cylinder stuck with an older-style 4-speed and the 6-cylinder using a newer 6-speed. The Journey’s towing capacity is on the light end, limited to 1,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder and 2,500 with the V6.

While reliability surveys back up the huge strides Hyundai has made in recent years, it still has to win over the masses.
What's New?This year a Sonata hybrid and Sonata plug-in hybrid round out the Sonata lineup, while Android Auto made its debut in late 2015. Other changes include lighter-weight suspension components, new wheels for the Limited trim, and automatic emergency braking on models equipped with forward-collision warning.
It’s no small feat that the 2016 Hyundai Sonata midsize sedan is a strongly competitive alternative to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Even against the rest of the market – which includes the Nissan Altima, Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, Volkswagen Passat, Chrysler 200 and Kia Optima – the 2016 Sonata stands apart. Credit goes in part to the choice of naturally aspirated or turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. The true fuel-sippers will like the available hybrid with up to 44 mpg, or the plug-in hybrid with up to 24 miles of EV range. It all comes with a comfortable and quiet interior, plenty of high-tech, and wrapped in conservatively attractive styling that’s sure to stay that way for years to come.
Used 2016 Hyundai Sonata PricingA base-model 2016 Hyundai Sonata SE has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $22,600, including the $835 destination charge. The Sonata SE represents a $600 jump, so expect a moderate increase of last year’s prices of about $24,000 for a Sonata Sport or Eco, and $27,300 for a Limited with the 2.4-liter engine. 2016 Sonata Hybrid prices start a little below $27,000, and plug-in hybrid prices haven’t been announced. Overall the Sonata competes solidly against the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, maintaining a slight price advantage for the most part. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. Note that the Sonata’s projected resale value is currently mid-pack compared to its competitors, and it’s slowly gaining on them over time.
Driving the Used 2016 Hyundai SonataThe base engine is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder putting out 185 horsepower. As the standard powerplant in Sonata SE, Sport and Limited models, it’s the most common, and along with the 6-speed automatic transmission, it offers satisfying acceleration and pretty good fuel economy. On the other end, there’s the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with its 245 horsepower taking on V6 engines from Honda, Toyota and Nissan. Straddling the line is the 1.6-liter turbocharged engine in the Eco model, a drivetrain that offers surprising acceleration, better-than-decent fuel economy, but an unrefined feel thanks to the sometimes-jerky 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The two hybrids, obviously, appeal to the most fuel-phobic types with their reliance on battery-supplemented propulsion. Drivetrain choices aside, the suspension is comfortable, the highway ride acceptably quiet, and the steering – long a sore spot on previous Sonata sedans – is actually pretty good for this class.
Interior ComfortAll 2016 Hyundai Sonata models get a new 7-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio, Bluetooth and USB smartphone integration, and Hyundai’s Blue Link telecommunications suite. Limited models get new wood trim, and automatic headlights are now standard across the board as well. It all complements a nicely laid-out and easy-to-use interior whose only real fault is being a bit on the bland side. Still, we like it, especially the comfortable front seats and hugely accommodating rear seat. There are clever touches, such as the intermittent-wiper speed shown on the 4.2-inch color display between the gauges.
Exterior StylingWhile the previous-generation Sonata had the styling turned up to 11, the current one has dialed it back to a more easy-listening 7. Hyundai says the 2016 Sonata is ""an athlete in a well-tailored suit,"" but we’ll just call it ""conservatively handsome"" and leave it at that. There’s still a sharp line of chrome extending from the headlights and down the flanks of the car, and Hybrid and Eco models all benefit from unique trim designed to enhance aerodynamics and improve fuel economy. There’s not a lot of envelope-pushing here, but it’s a good-looking car that will likely age well.
Favorite FeaturesVARIETYThere’s a 2016 Sonata to fill just about any midsize-sedan need. Want a budget-conscious 4-door? The base Sonata SE has you covered, while sporty sedan drivers will appreciate the Sonata Sport 2.0T. Hyundai even offers three different fuel-sippers, the Sonata Eco, and the Sonata Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid.
ANDROID AUTOThe 2016 Sonata benefits from the newest advance in in-car infotainment: Android Auto, which fully integrates your Android phone experience into the 8-inch touch screen in the Sonata’s dash. It’s as familiar to use as your phone, and really, isn’t that what we all want from our infotainment systems?
Standard FeaturesThanks to a few upgrades this year, the 2016 Hyundai Sonata SE closes the gap a bit compared to mid-line models. Automatic headlights, a new 7-inch touch screen with USB and Bluetooth smartphone integration, and a rearview camera are now all standard equipment. These add to features such as air conditioning, power windows with pinch protection, power locks, a driver’s blind-spot mirror, stability and traction control, and cloth seats. Other standard features include a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a 60/40-split fold-down rear seatback.
Factory OptionsAside from the escalating features you get as you move from SE to Sport to Limited models, The 2016 Hyundai Sonata offers a long list of options. There’s Android Auto, which allows you to use apps and features on your Google-powered smartphone through a USB connection. Other options include a 10-speaker Infinity sound system, smart cruise control with stop/start capability, automatic high beams, ventilated front seats and a panoramic tilt/slide sunroof. There’s also a hands-free trunk release; if you have your keys with you, it automatically opens the trunk lid after you stand behind the car for a few seconds.
Engine & TransmissionNo fewer than five 4-cylinder engine choices await 2016 Sonata buyers. Most new Hyundai Sonata models will come with the standard 2.4-liter inline-4, a 185-horsepower powerplant that’s more than adequate for most drivers. Those needing extra power can opt for the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and its 245 horsepower. A 1.6-liter turbo puts out less horsepower (177) but more torque (195 lb-ft) than the standard 2.4, and is only available with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic in the Sonata Eco. The two hybrid models – regular and plug-in flavors – share a 154-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, but use different electric motors. We think most buyers will be more than happy with the standard 2.4-liter engine, and while the 7-speed automatic needs refinement, the Sonata Eco is surprisingly quick.

Driving the  2021 Honda Accord HybridThe ride is smooth enough to make buyers think twice about getting an Acura or a Lexus. Especially in Touring trim with its adaptive suspension. And even though the Accord doesn’t make driver involvement a specific virtue — like the Mazda6, for example — there’s still enough composure and control to make this roomy midsize sedan at least mildly entertaining.
Acceleration is more effective at lower speeds because that’s where the electric motor makes the most difference. At higher speeds, this drivetrain isn’t able to exert its muscle in the same manner. Overtaking on the freeway might require a little more thought and timing.
A once-common complaint about hybrids was that the brakes felt odd. It was the trade-off that came with a regenerative braking system collecting energy that would go to waste in a conventional car. The Accord Hybrid does not suffer from this phenomenon. Its brakes feel like nothing out of the ordinary. But the system still works well. And for a greater level of regeneration, there’s a lever on the steering column.
Interior ComfortIn common with its combustion-only compadres, the 2021 Accord Hybrid has a spacious and well-designed 5-seater cabin full of classy materials. The only thing that might take some familiarization is the row of switches instead of a traditional gearshift lever. But that does keep the center console nice and neat.
Rear legroom is a class-leading 40.4 inches, fractionally better than the larger Toyota Avalon. Headroom is also generous. And cargo space is exactly the same as the non-hybrid model at a commodious 16.7 cubic feet. This model’s rear seats also split and fold in the usual 60/40 way. Wherever Honda has put the hybrid battery, it certainly hasn’t affected passenger or luggage space.
The only minor compromise is that this Accord Hybrid model doesn’t have a spare wheel. Instead, it comes with a tire repair kit and 24-hour roadside assistance.
Exterior StylingThis isn’t meant to be a criticism, but the 2021 Accord Hybrid has something of a Teflon design. The looks don’t tend to stick in the memory, even with a slightly revised-for-2021 front end.
That’s fine in several respects. For example, there’s nothing offensive or incongruous. And chances are the overall styling will wear well as the calendar ticks by.
One aspect more easily recalled is the sloping roof. It follows the current trend for a profile that’s reminiscent of a coupe. But Honda has been clever and kept the roofline from impeding rear passenger space.
Apart from a couple of badges, there are no major visible differences from the rest of the 2021 Accord lineup. This hybrid keeps its profile as low as its emissions.
The first three trim levels have 17-inch alloy wheels, with the option for 19-inch rims. The top-line Touring model has these larger alloy wheels as standard. The only options for exterior paint (at $395) are Platinum White Pearl, Sonic Gray Pearl, and Radiant Red Metallic.
Favorite FeaturesHYBRID DRIVETRAIN
Yes, we know that’s the whole point of buying a hybrid. But this one is particularly effective. And particularly smooth. The electric motor does the bulk of the work under low loads. Yet there’s no thunk when the gasoline engine has to kick in, which then either adds to the drive or works as an onboard generator.
INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
Even though Honda has most aspects of car manufacturing mastered, there have been a few missteps. Like not including a regular, physical volume control for the infotainment system. This situation has been rectified, and now there’s one for tuning as well. We’re also glad the 8-inch touchscreen is now standard throughout the range.
Standard FeaturesHats off to Honda for making the Accord Hybrid available in a range of trim levels. The most affordable base level still comes with dual-zone automatic climate control, LED low-beam headlights, keyless entry/ignition, active noise cancellation, cloth upholstery, and selectable driving modes.
The infotainment system is based around an 8-inch touchscreen and includes Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration (wireless in the higher trims), Bluetooth phone/audio, two USB ports, and a 4-speaker/180-watt audio system.
Safety features included the Honda Sensing systems (itemized in our Safety Technology section), automatic high beams, and a multi-angle rearview camera with dynamic guidelines.
Factory OptionsAcquiring more equipment in a new Accord Hybrid is more a case of going for a higher trim level than scanning the options list. However, parking sensors and wireless charging are offered for the base model.
The EX adds things like blind-spot monitoring, LED fog lights, moonroof, heated front seats, power-adjustable driver’s seat, satellite radio, two more USB ports, and four more speakers for the audio system. EX-L brings leather seating surfaces, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, parking sensors at both ends, a self-dimming rearview mirror, and an even better sound system.
Touring trim is the most lavish, with an adaptive suspension, a head-up display, heated/ventilated front seats, heated rear seats in the outboard positions, rain-sensing wipers, navigation, Wi-Fi, and a passenger-side mirror that tilts down automatically when reverse gear is selected.
Engine & TransmissionAlthough some regular Accord models have a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, it’s not the same as the one under the Accord Hybrid’s aluminum hood. This unit is naturally aspirated (no turbochargers or superchargers) and augmented by an electric motor running off a lithium-ion battery.
The combined output is 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque, which is more than the turbo 1.4-liter engine in the lower reaches of the non-hybrid Accord range. A specialized transmission sends that energy to just the front wheels. 
The Accord Hybrid also has active grille shutters as standard, for optimum aerodynamic and thermal efficiency. Fuel economy is impressive, even in the relatively thirstier range-topping Touring trim. Either way, regular gasoline works fine.

The 2021 Honda Accord Hybrid midsize sedan is one of those rare ideal cars. It has plenty of space for occupants and cargo, a pleasant cabin environment, strong reliability, several standard safety systems, superb fuel economy, a satisfying amount of muscle, and an engaging driving experience.
The Honda Accord is already exceptionally good. We’re often giving it the Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award. Where this hybrid variant makes its case is the balance between usable power and outstanding fuel economy.
A hybrid makes so much sense in stop/go traffic. And even if the slight price premium over a conventional alternative (using just an internal combustion engine) would take some miles to recoup, that’s not always why buyers choose a hybrid. Knowing it has lower emissions is often good enough.
The rest of the 2021 Honda Accord range is reviewed separately.

Performance buffs will love the Abarth trim.","ConsIn the all-important realm of resale and reliability, the 2016 Fiat 500 has yet to surpass more established cars like the Honda Fit and Mini Cooper. Those with larger frames may find the 500’s interior a bit too snug for comfort.",18000,"Driving the Used 2016 FIAT 500The Fiat 500 subcompact for 2016 is pretty light on its feet, which is why it can get away with having only 101 horsepower under its diminutive bonnet. Acceleration and passing power are admittedly underwhelming, but in urban traffic the 500 zips about quite nicely. The 500’s go-kart-like handling allows it to dart through congested traffic, and its mere 140-inch length permits parking in the most unexpected places. The 500’s steering is precise with a nicely weighted wheel to help things along. Although a 5-speed manual is available, the majority of 500s will leave the showroom with Fiat’s 6-speed automatic. Opt for the 160-horsepower Abarth and you’ll get much better performance, improved handling and bit more respect from the bad boys. Looking to save the planet rather than conquer it? The electric 500e can travel up to 87 miles while emitting zero emissions.
Interior ComfortFiat’s subcompact 500 for 2016 is roomier up front than you might expect, and just as tight in back as it looks. The interior style lives up to the promise of the quirky but fashionable exterior, and we found the materials, build quality and seat comfort impressive for a car with a starting price around $18,000. As the athlete of the group, the Fiat 500 Abarth offers aggressively bolstered front seats, exclusive red stitching and a thick-rimmed, flat-bottom steering wheel.
Exterior StylingThe subcompact 2016 Fiat 500 is a modern interpretation of 1957’s tiny, rear-engined original. Although larger than the original, it’s still seven inches shorter than today’s Mini Cooper. The iconic sloping rear end embodies the 500’s personality, though it limits rear headroom. The Fiat 500 is available in a stretched 4-door model that alleviates many of the coupe’s shortcomings. The hatchback offers Pop, Easy, Sport, Lounge, 1957 and Turbo trim levels, while the soft-top 500c comes in Pop, Easy and Lounge. The Turbo, Abarth and 500e electric are their own packages. Wheels, fascias and body trim differentiate the models.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT POWER CONVERTIBLE TOP Unlike a conventional convertible that retracts into a well, the 2016 Fiat 500c employs a canvas roll-top design that opens the cabin to the outside world while leaving a protective metal frame in place. An added advantage is the top can be opened at speeds up to 60 mph. 
Eco:DRIVE As if there weren’t enough high-tech geekery in the world today, the Fiat 500 allows its owners to upload data about everything from trip information to CO2 emissions. The data can be stored on a flash drive where drivers can analyze it in hopes of improving driving efficiency.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Fiat 500 and 500c Pop include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15-inch covered steel wheels, a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, cruise control, power window/locks/mirrors, Bluetooth, and a 6-speaker audio system with a USB port for portable music players. The range-topping Abarth variant includes a 276-watt Alpine audio system, 16-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension and a leather-wrapped dashboard. Standard safety features include seven airbags, hill-start assist to help prevent vehicle rollback on steep inclines and seemingly all the other advancements we’re seeing on new cars in this price range and beyond.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded 2016 Fiat 500 Lounge includes a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather seats, heated front seats, rear parking sensors, Beats by Dr. Dre audio system and automatic climate control. The 500 Sport model is differentiated by a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch wheels and a variety of aesthetic touches including red brake calipers and a subtle rear spoiler. The Turbo model adds larger front brakes and more serious suspension tuning to go with its specific 16-inch wheels and identifying trim. The mighty Abarth offers larger 17-inch wheels, 2-tone leather-trimmed seats and your choice of either white or red body-side stripes.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive 2016 Fiat 500 is motivated by a small but sophisticated 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine using Fiat’s patented MultiAir technology, which varies intake-valve timing and lift. Fiat tunes this engine to three power levels: The base 500 gets 101 horsepower (naturally aspirated), the Turbo makes 135 horsepower and the Abarth, also turbocharged, cranks out 160 horsepower. The 500e electric is rated for 111 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. All of the 500s now offer the choice of a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. We like the automatic for its extra ratio and responsive shifting though it does cut fuel efficiency by more than 10 percent. The 500e uses a single-speed automatic.

The 500 now offers the UConnect 5.0 system with 5-inch touch screen, Bluetooth and integrated voice commands. Oregon joins California in offering the 500e electric model.
The 2016 Fiat 500 coupe and its drop-top doppelganger, the 500c, have surprised a lot of skeptics. The duo prove that not only can a frugal small car be fun and colorful, it can also win over the hearts and minds of Americans accustomed to larger modes of transportation. Although not as large as a Mini Cooper Hardtop or Ford Fiesta, the 500 makes up for its lack of rear-seat room with its playful attitude, lengthy list of features and wide model range that includes the performance-oriented Abarth and all-electric 500e. Better still, the 500’s detailed design both inside and out doesn’t equate to an exorbitant price tag, making us question why more car companies don’t follow suit.

The 2016 Ford Fiesta ST, meanwhile, is among the few and proud performance-oriented subcompacts.","ConsIf maximum cargo space and higher resale value are greater priorities, you may be more interested in the Honda Fit. If value pricing and a long warranty are what you’re seeking, check out the Kia Rio, which starts under $15,000 and offers 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain coverage.",15000,"What's New?The big news for the 2016 Ford Fiesta is the availability of Sync 3. This makes the Fiesta among the first of Ford’s vehicles to receive the latest – and much better – touch-based infotainment system. Remote keyless entry becomes standard; ditto, a perimeter alarm and two USB charging ports.
The Fiesta is Ford’s smallest and least expensive car, a subcompact that competes with rivals like the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio and Chevrolet Sonic. Despite its entry-level status and sub-$16,000 starting price, the Fiesta brings efficiency, good looks and robust technology to the table. In addition to the sedan, a 5-door hatchback version increases the Fiesta’s cargo flexibility, while the hopped-up Fiesta ST packs a surprising punch thanks to a turbocharged engine boasting nearly 200 horsepower. If fuel economy is of higher concern, the 2016 Fiesta can achieve up to 43 mpg with an optional turbocharged 3-cylinder engine. The Fiesta is due for a refresh soon, but even five years into its current generation, this small sedan and hatchback offer much to like.
Used 2016 Ford Fiesta PricingThe 2016 Ford Fiesta S sedan – the least expensive model – has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $15,455. Unless the lowest price is of highest concern, we recommend at least stepping up to the mid-trim Fiesta SE, which begins at a still-reasonable $16,685. A top-line Fiesta Titanium bows at $19,405. Opting for the hatchback version of any of these three trims is $300 more. The hatchback-only Fiesta ST begins at $22,335. Stuff a 2016 Fiesta with options, and you’re looking at a low- to mid-$20,000 subcompact. This is in line with competitors such as the Chevrolet Sonic and Honda Fit. Undercutting the Fiesta’s starting price are the Nissan Versa Note, Kia Rio and Mitsubishi Mirage. Before buying, check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Fiesta’s residual value has traditionally been about average, but lagged the leading Honda Fit.
Driving the Used 2016 Ford FiestaAutomakers often soften their European-based cars for the U.S. market, but thankfully that isn’t the case for the Fiesta. The result is a car that, despite its small size, is comfortable and controlled. The bonus is, when you push the Fiesta on that curved onramp or sweeping road, it responds with surprising balance, communication and grip. And if you like that sort of thing, you’ll respond with a smile. Of the three powerplants offered, the standard 120-horsepower 4-cylinder is adequate. The newer turbocharged 3-cylinder is an efficiency champ that also grants surprisingly smooth power delivery. Then there’s the performance-oriented Fiesta ST. With 197 horsepower and sport-tuned suspension and steering, it’s the clear athlete of the group. A 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is available on the standard engine, while the 3-cylinder and the ST come only with manuals, 5- and 6-speeds, respectively.
Interior ComfortAs either a sedan or hatchback, the 2016 Ford Fiesta offers seating for five. It should come as no surprise, however, that rear-seat legroom is cramped in this subcompact. With over 25 cubic feet of cargo room with the rear seats folded, the Fiesta hatchback is impressively roomy. All sedans also have 60/40-folding rear seats to accommodate larger items. Lower-trim models are rather Spartan affairs with basic but easy-to-use controls. If you’re willing to spend more, you can be treated to white-on-black leather seats, contrasting seat piping, ambient lighting and push-button start.
Exterior StylingAs either a traditional 4-door sedan or a practical 5-door hatchback, the 2016 Ford Fiesta wears a stylish and distinctive suit. In addition to swallowing more cargo, the hatchback offers better proportions, at least to our eyes. The Fiesta ST is endowed with more aggressive style befitting its performance nature. The hatchback is positioned as the primary model, yet across the board you’ll be hard-pressed to find cheap-looking trim. In addition to bright colors across all but the base S trim level, new for 2016 is the SE Black Package with darkened wheels, exterior mirror housings and other treatments.
Favorite FeaturesSYNC 3The 2016 Fiesta is among the first Fords to get the latest and greatest version of the Sync infotainment system. It’s much better than the outgoing one. Where that previous system was marred by too-small alphanumerics and latent response, Sync 3 and its 6.5-inch touch screen are faster and easier to operate.
ECOBOOST ENGINESThe Fiesta offers two different turbocharged engines: a 3-cylinder designed for maximum fuel economy, and a 4-cylinder designed for maximum fun. But as is usual with turbochargers, lead-footed real-world driving can run up fuel consumption.
Standard FeaturesEven in its least expensive form as the Fiesta S sedan, Ford’s small economy car includes air conditioning, 4-speaker AM/FM radio with auxiliary input, Sync AppLink that works with smartphones, dual USB inputs and keyless entry. You will, however, still have to crank your own windows. SE models add cruise control, power windows and the MyKey system that lets you set driving parameters, such as limiting top speed – a good idea for households with younger drivers. Top-line Titanium trims include rearview camera with reverse-sensing system, Sony premium audio, leather seating (heated in front), automatic climate control and the latest Sync system.
Factory OptionsPopular options for the 2016 Fiesta include the Sync infotainment system, navigation, power moonroof, heated front seats, satellite radio where available, and automatic transmission. The potent Fiesta ST hatchback can be made racier with hood stripes and Recaro seats. Wheels ranging up to 17 inches are also available. The Fuel Economy Package on SE models adds the 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine for better fuel efficiency.
Engine & TransmissionThree engines are available for the 2016 Ford Fiesta. The standard powerplant, and the one that will be the best choice for the majority of buyers, is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 120 horsepower and offers a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. For the fuel-sipping crowd, there’s a 1.0-liter 3-cylinder turbo with a 5-speed manual transmission. It puts out more horsepower and torque than the standard engine yet achieves considerably better fuel economy. If saving gasoline is the least of your concerns, a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine and 6-speed manual gearbox await you in the 197-horsepower Fiesta ST. All Fiestas are front-wheel drive (FWD).

A 5-door hatchback such as the Mazda3, Mini Cooper hardtop and Fiat 500L all offer unique styling, plus more room for people and cargo.",20600,"Driving the Used 2016 Volkswagen BeetleDepending on the engine, the 2016 Volkswagen Beetle coupe can either feel like a peppy go-kart or a racy coupe. The standard engine for all but the R-Line is VW’s 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that delivers both good acceleration and fuel economy. If you’re seeking GTI-like acceleration, the R-Line’s 210-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo can deliver it. Both engines offer the option of a manual (5-speed on the 1.8T, 6-speed on the R-Line) or automatic transmission. While the R-Line’s stiffer suspension provides better handling, it’s not so stiff as to make it unpalatable to the Beetle’s intended audience. Overall, the Beetle returns a softer ride than the Mini Cooper or Fiat 500, and its interior is quieter and more comfortable. At freeway speeds, the Beetle feels stable and solid, returning the kind of ride and handling more commonly associated with a midsize sedan.
Interior ComfortCoupe or convertible, all 2016 VW Beetles have four seats. The front seats are spacious but the rear seats are tight. The Beetle’s interior is clean and simple with easy-to-use controls. A center armrest makes long commutes more comfortable. Multiple storage bins in the center console hold cell phones and small items. And there’s the ""kaeferfach"" – an upper, secondary glove box that’s a throwback to Bugs of yore. Coupe models have a hatchback design and surprising cargo space – 15.4 cubic feet with rear seats upright. Convertibles have less than half that space, and trunk access is rather awkward.
Exterior StylingLess Flower. More Power. Today’s Beetle is bigger, beefier and sportier-looking than the New Beetle that came before it with a built-in vase. VW’s 2016 Beetle and Beetle Convertible are still instantly recognizable, but their iconic shape has been elongated and now looks more like their sexy cousin, the Audi TT. A rear spoiler that’s standard on the R-Line and optional on other models injects sporty appeal and a visual break from the rest of the Beetle’s mounds of round. Convertible Beetle models have a power-operated folding fabric top and a trunklid instead of the hardtop’s liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesMANUAL TRANSMISSIONS A dying feature in most cars, Volkswagen arms the 2016 VW Beetle with two manual transmission choices: a 5-speed for the 1.8T, and a 6-speed for the 2.0-liter R-Line. 
INTERIOR LAYOUT The Beetle’s interior is retro done right, paying homage to the original while making its 21st-century occupants feel like they’re riding in a $40,000 luxury coupe.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 VW Beetle lineup consists of two models and three trims: S, SE and SEL. The least expensive S model includes an automatic transmission, 16-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, air conditioning, cloth seats, 5-inch MIB II touch-screen radio with USB port, Bluetooth, cruise control, heated power mirrors and a rear spoiler. The SE trim adds a 6.3-inch MIB II touch-screen radio with App-Connect, a rearview camera and a 5-speed manual transmission. The SEL brings 18-inch wheels, navigation and Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert. All new VWs come with one year/10,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2016 Beetle by VW are dependent on trim and include a navigation system, panoramic sunroof, keyless access, 18-inch alloy wheels, and premium Fender audio system. R-Line models can be had with bi-xenon headlights, leather interior and upgraded 19-inch wheels. Accessories to personalize the Beetle include a rear spoiler, retro-style wheels, body styling kit, and nickname badges on the rear, e.g., to call your new Beetle a ""Bug.""
Engine & TransmissionWith the TDI temporarily removed for 2016, the two remaining engines are both gasoline-powered and turbocharged. The 1.8-liter turbocharged gasoline engine churns out 170 horsepower and up to 33 mpg, and it offers a good balance of pep and efficiency. The zippiest Beetle is the R-Line with its 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine that makes 210 horsepower. All Beetles are front-wheel drive. As mentioned in Favorite Features, manual transmissions are widely available across the Beetle lineup, but the 6-speed automatic DSG is just as recommendable. The turbo gasoline engine in 1.8-liter models can run on regular unleaded; premium is recommended in the R-Line.

By evolving the original Beetles styling to meet 21st-century demands, the 2016 VW Beetle is set to win over a whole new generation. Like its ancestor, the Beetle is cute and affordable. Unlike the first Beetle, however, this latest version is loaded with modern safety and high-tech features, comes in a number of colors and offers a choice between two powerful turbocharged engines. The 2016 Beetle elongates the original car’s form, creating a silhouette more reminiscent of a vintage Porsche 356. Unique wheels for each trim further set the Beetle apart from the Mini Cooper and Fiat 500, as does its considerably larger size both inside and out. Regrettably, the excellent TDI diesel engine won’t be offered until its emissions issues are resolved.

And while there are Shelby versions waiting in the wings, the 707-horsepower Challenger Hellcat dominates the horsepower wars.",24500,"Driving the Used 2016 Ford MustangWith an independent rear suspension for the first time in its history, the new Ford Mustang coupe and Mustang convertible finally handle like a modern car. But not only is it more nimble than its solid-axle predecessors, it’s just better in day-to-day driving, with a smoothed-out ride that has none of the jittery rear-end motions the old car had. Whether you choose the V6, new EcoBoost 4-cylinder or (obviously) the V8, all Mustang models are notably quick. However, it’s the last of these that truly sounds like a Ford Mustang should, with an auditory rumble and roar that’s pure Americana. If you opt for the 6-speed manual, you’ll enjoy the short throws and solid feel that make this a solid choice for enthusiasts. If you instead prefer the 6-speed automatic, you can still pick your own gears with paddles mounted on the steering wheel.
Interior ComfortWhile all 2016 Mustang models get a coolly retro-yet-modern interior style, Premium Mustang models justify their added cost with better materials and features. All Mustangs offer easy-to-reach audio and climate controls, sturdy switches and comfortable front seats. The two small rear seats are meant for short-term use, especially considering the poor headroom in coupes. On the other hand, the trunk is bigger than you might expect – 13.5 cubic feet in coupes, 11.4 in convertibles – and the rear seats fold flat to accommodate longer items. The Mustang convertible uses a one-hand release latch for the power-operated soft top.
Exterior StylingWith its long hood, short trunk, sloping rear glass and tri-bar taillights, the 2016 Ford Mustang could never be mistaken for anything other than Ford’s pony car. Yet this is no throwback, as the sleek lines, aggressive headlights and windswept design prove. Gone is the bulkiness of the previous design, replaced with a lower, wider-looking car that, from most angles, is beautiful. Convertibles look best with the lined and insulated fabric top folded, but even when up it’s still unmistakably Mustang. On the functional end, the active grille shutters on 2.3-liter models can close to redirect airflow, improving aerodynamics.
Favorite FeaturesSAFETY SYSTEMSModern cars are about having it all, and anyone buying a new Mustang will find a classic pony car built with all the latest safety systems. Whether it’s blind-spot monitoring or forward-collision alert, it’s as modern as you’d want.
IT’S BURNOUT-READYOn the other hand, if you’re looking at a new Mustang 5.0, Ford is so sure you want to burn rubber that it’s equipped all 2016 Mustang GTs with the ""line-lock"" mode that locks the front brakes for standing burnouts. Manual-transmission GT models also include launch control for maximum acceleration.
Standard FeaturesThe base Mustang V6 comes nicely equipped, with push-button start, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio with an auxiliary input, rearview camera, Ford’s Sync communication and entertainment system, high-intensity headlights, 17-inch wheels, and selectable-effort power steering. Also standard on all Mustangs is Track Apps, which displays performance metrics such as acceleration times. Opt for an EcoBoost model and you’ll get the 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, plus 6-way-power front seats and 18-inch wheels. GT models include the 5.0-liter V8, 19-inch wheels, the line-lock feature, and launch control on manual-transmission models.
Factory OptionsIn addition to this year’s new option packages, there are multiple ways to make your new Mustang perform better, be more comfortable or simply look better. Upgrades for the base V6 models include a 6-speed automatic transmission, power front seats, parking sensors and 18-inch wheels. There’s a 12-speaker Shaker audio system, navigation, leather seats and safety features such as blind-spot monitoring and forward-collision alert available for EcoBoost and top-line GT models. Adaptive cruise control is also now available on Ford’s 4-seat performance car, as are heated and cooled front seats and performance packages.
Engine & TransmissionThree engines are available for the 2016 Mustang, and none is a loser. The base V6 Mustang comes with Ford’s 300-horsepower 3.7-liter V6, while the top-line GT uses a 435-horsepower 5.0-liter V8. The newest member of the Mustang engine family is a 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 310 horsepower. Not only does it out-muscle the V6, it’s also the most fuel-efficient Mustang engine, with up to 32 mpg. All Mustangs are rear-wheel drive and can be fitted with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The Shelby GT350 is in its own class with a 5.2-liter flat-plane V8 putting out 526 horsepower, coming connected solely to a 6-speed manual transmission.

If minimizing overall transportation costs is among your key considerations, your new midsize sedan is probably waiting for you at another dealership.",23000,"Driving the Used 2016 Volkswagen PassatWhy didn’t the Passat’s 2016 model year update include any significant powertrain or suspension changes? Because it was already among the best-driving midsize sedans on the road. Delivering a sophisticated highway ride that keeps drivers connected and everyone comfortable, the Passat also shows off a playful, athletic side when the opportunities present themselves. Our chief quibble is that the turbocharged engine isn’t particularly smooth to engage in the stop-and-go of city driving, the upside being that it’s among the most satisfying and most efficient engines in the segment. The Passat also offers a 280-horsepower V6, but the added power isn’t worth the added cost and reduced efficiency for most buyers (and the dual-clutch automatic transmission paired with the V6 also hinders off-the-line smoothness).
Interior ComfortThere’s nothing subtle about the cavernous interior dimensions. If you regularly shuttle NBA players or regular-size adults, the 2016 Volkswagen Passat and its uncommonly roomy rear seat are must-sees. Included in the model’s 2016 update are a redesigned gauge cluster, enhanced details, improved materials and an overdue tech upgrade. Touch-screen control plus Bluetooth and USB connectivity are standard across the line now, and the available Car-Net system that provides Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration also enables a variety of advanced services. For example, your computer can be alerted if your teen driver has exceeded a set speed or boundary.
Exterior StylingThe changes are subtle at first glance, but the 2016 Volkswagen Passat has been redesigned from the windshield forward to give the sedan a more commanding presence, with a newly sculpted hood, slimmer headlights and bolder grille adding both refinement and strength. The new Passat R-Line variant takes the sportiness a step further, with unique front and rear styling touches, darker 19-inch wheels and more. The Passat’s tech upgrade includes the ability to open the trunk when your hands are full by waving your foot under the rear bumper (when the key is in your pocket or purse).
Favorite FeaturesAPPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are going to revolutionize in-car infotainment, and the Volkswagen Passat is among the first midsize sedans to offer both. Choose a song, dictate a text message or navigate to a destination with the ease and familiarity of your smartphone. 
ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL Radar-based “smart” cruise control is becoming more common on mainstream vehicles, but it’s still a surprise-and-delight feature in anything this side of the luxury set. Set your speed and the Passat will automatically slow down when it approaches slower traffic, and speed up again when the road is clear.
Standard FeaturesAt its starting sticker price of just over $23,000 with destination charges, the 2016 Volkswagen Passat 1.8T S has a 170-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, 6-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift mode, dual-zone climate control, auto headlights, infotainment system with 5-inch display, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, rearview camera, 60/40-split-folding rear seat, cloth seats and Automatic Post-Collision Braking System. Not a bad list.
Factory OptionsIn addition to a moonroof, leather seats, premium audio and other traditional upgrades, the new Passat offers a long list of modern amenities as you climb the price ladder. Radar-based smart cruise control and semi-automatic parallel parking are great conveniences, while Forward Collision Warning, Lane Assist, and Rear Traffic Alert with Braking are terrific modern safety features. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto enter the picture with VW Car-Net at around $27,000, while keyless entry and push-button start aren’t available for less than about $29,000.
Engine & TransmissionWith Volkswagen’s popular diesel engines on administrative leave for EPA violations, the 2016 Volkswagen Passat lineup includes two engines. Most buyers will choose the 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission. With underbody aerodynamic improvements and a couple mechanical tweaks, this combination is now rated to deliver an impressive 38 mpg on the highway, up from 36 mpg last year. Models equipped with the powerful 3.6-liter V6 engine option also feature a quick-shifting dual-clutch automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, both of which combine to deliver even more European feel. All Passats are front-wheel drive.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Volkswagen Passat has been nipped and tucked for 2016, a makeover that includes revised front, rear and interior styling, plus a long list of new technology features. The diesel-powered Passat TDI is on hiatus until further notice, but the lineup gains a sportier-looking new Passat R-Line variant.
As the midsize- sedan segment’s only European entry, the 2016 Volkswagen Passat is among the most enjoyable drivers in the class. Even when not on the Autobahn, the Passat’s confidence-inspiring driving dynamics make for a satisfying and relaxing driving experience. But this Passat was designed specifically for North American tastes and preferences – it’s even built in Chattanooga, Tennessee – so it’s also roomy, practical and priced to compete with midsize-sedan staples like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. For 2016 the Passat receives a much-needed makeover to help it compete even better, and is among the first vehicles to offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.

Drivers requiring enhanced traction for foul weather or Jeep’s Trail-Rated off-road ability can choose between two 4-wheel-drive (4WD) systems for the Patriot.","ConsAs one of the oldest vehicles in Jeep’s lineup, the Patriot lacks the refinement, freshness and advanced safety features of just about every rival. And while it wears the Jeep name, the Patriot is based on front-wheel-drive (FWD) architecture and isn’t built to hop boulders like a Wrangler.",18000,"Used 2016 Jeep Patriot PricingThe 2016 Jeep Patriot has an alluring Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $18,000, making it the least expensive new SUV, but you’ll have to forgo such comforts as power windows and air conditioning. Better-equipped versions run in the $20,000 range, and a Latitude model with the High Altitude package can bump $30,000. At these prices, most Patriot models still undercut the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and Subaru Forester, but those rivals are newer and generally more appealing. Still, there’s no denying that the Patriot is an inexpensive SUV to buy and own, and it’s just coming off a win for the Kelley Blue Book 5-Year Cost to Own Award in the Compact SUV/Crossover category. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Jeep Patriot. Long-term residual value is another aspect in which the Patriot lags competitors.
Driving the Used 2016 Jeep PatriotJeeps have a long history of favoring off-road capability over on-road comfort. Most models of the Patriot, though, don’t stand out in either setting. Yes, you can get a Patriot that is Trail-Rated to slog through mud, snow and up to 19 inches of water, but to do so you must option up to the Freedom Drive II package. On the asphalt where most Patriots will roam, Jeep’s least expensive SUV is simply outclassed by newer rivals that offer better performance, handling, ride quality and fuel economy. Neither of the Patriot’s available 4-cylinder engines feels very strong, and the CVT transmission does more for fuel economy than it does for performance, although the optional 6-speed automatic improves the latter. Highway ride and handling are okay, as long as you don’t compare the Patriot to a more refined small SUV – of which there are plenty.
Interior ComfortThe 2016 Jeep Patriot features a 2-row, 5-passenger interior. Depending on trim level and options, it ranges from simple and utilitarian with hard plastic surfaces to nicely equipped with leather seats and a 6.5-inch touch-screen navigation and entertainment system. In base models you’ll have to pay extra for a driver’s seat that adjusts for height, and no Patriot model comes with a steering wheel that telescopes, making it more difficult to find a perfect driving position. The rear seats do fold nearly flat for extra cargo capacity, and in all but the base model also recline.
Exterior StylingFew will mistake the Patriot with its 4-door Wrangler Unlimited sibling, but at least the family resemblance is there. Like its beefier brother, the Patriot has a boxy shape, Jeep’s traditional front grille with seven vertical slots and signature round headlights. Standard roof rails add to the Patriot’s presence and practicality. For added toughness, skidplates and tow hooks are fitted to models equipped with the Freedom Drive II off-road package. Base Sport models ride on 16-inch steel wheels, while the Patriot Latitude version comes with 17-inch aluminum versions.
Favorite FeaturesFREEDOM DRIVE I For those facing seasonal road conditions, Freedom Drive I provides a full-time 4-wheel-drive system designed to give year-round peace of mind. You won’t be tackling the Rubicon Trail with Freedom Drive I, but you could tow your ATV to where the trail starts.
FREEDOM DRIVE II OFF-ROAD PACKAGEFor those preferring the road less traveled – or no road at all – Jeep offers the optional Freedom Drive II Off-Road Package. It includes a 2nd-generation CVT transaxle with low range, 17-inch all-terrain tires and an abundance of skidplates, tow hooks and fog lights.
Standard FeaturesWe’ll say it again: The Patriot’s base price is tempting, but it buys only a budget vehicle in the strictest sense. You’ll have to crank your own windows, lock the doors manually and even forgo air conditioning. What you will get is a 5-speed manual transmission, cruise control and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with auxiliary input and, new for this year, hands-free phone connectivity and SiriusXM satellite radio. A better bet is to step up to the Latitude model, which includes the basic creature comforts omitted in the Sport trim, plus heated front seats, power outlet, keyless entry and automatic headlights.
Factory OptionsBoth trims of the Jeep Patriot can be had with either of the Freedom Drive 4WD systems. On the Sport model, you can get power windows and creature comforts like air conditioning. The new Sport SE package bundles a leather-trimmed steering wheel with built-in audio controls, heated front seats and 17-inch wheels. Latitude models can be had with infotainment and navigation systems with a 6.5-inch touch screen, while the High Altitude package bundles the leather interior, power-adjustable driver’s seat and sunroof. New for 2016 is an optional rearview camera, a feature that’s standard in rivals like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2016 Jeep Patriots offer two 4-cylinder engines and a trio of transmissions. The base engine is a 2.0-liter that’s for front-wheel-drive (FWD) models only. A more powerful 2.4-liter engine is optional on either model and is necessary if you want 4WD. A 5-speed manual transmission is standard for both engines. The automatic transmission offerings are a 6-speed (now only with the 2.4-liter engine) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Models with the Freedom Drive II off-road system use the CVT that has a 19:1 crawl ratio for slowly navigating touchy off-road conditions. The Patriot’s towing capacity maxes out at 2,000 pounds. The Patriot isn’t all that fuel-efficient – especially with the Freedom Drive II package – but at least it uses regular unleaded gasoline.

Bluetooth phone connectivity finally becomes standard, and the new Sport SE package bundles more popular features. An all-new Jeep model is set to replace both the aging Patriot and Compass SUVs.
The 2016 Patriot stakes its claim as being the least expensive new SUV you can buy, and a Jeep to boot. That’s the appeal of this 2-row, 5-passenger sport-utility vehicle. But in just about every other aspect, Jeep’s aging entry-level model lags rival compact-crossover SUVs.

If this is what you want, nothing else will do. Where else can you make monthly payments on 707 horsepower?","ConsIf you’re not interested in this sort of performance, go someplace else; there are choices. For a performance enthusiast, the only reason you’re not interested is if someplace you wear a Ford oval or Chevrolet bowtie tattoo. But the strongest Mustang or Camaro won’t crank out 707 horsepower.",27990,"Driving the Used 2016 Dodge ChallengerThe attention-grabber of the 2016 Challenger line is the SRT Hellcat and its 707-horsepower supercharged V8 engine, but all versions are good-driving cars. The two non-supercharged Hemi V8s are as strong as anyone could reasonably want, but the 707-horsepower SRT Hellcat is beyond verbal description, with acceleration that is essentially impossible to experience on a public road. To cope with the Hellcat’s power the suspension has been firmed up, but it’s no stiffer than, say, a Corvette. At steady cruising speeds engine noise is subdued, with the supercharger whine noticeable only as revs rise. Put the Hellcat and non-supercharged SRT Challengers into Track mode, and you get sharper throttle response, harder upshifts from the automatic transmission and a firming up of the shock absorbers. Then hang on.
Interior ComfortInside, the new Dodge Challenger is pleasant, comfortable and functional. In the center of the instrument panel is the touch screen that we’ve liked in other Dodge and Chrysler vehicles. The retro-style gauges for tach and speedometer look fantastic, and there’s a sharp-display TFT screen nestled between the two. There’s plenty of room in front for driver and front-seat passenger, and the rear seat can accommodate three people (although they might be snug), making the Challenger the only muscle car deserving of that claim. Even the trunk is surprisingly large and useful, despite a pretty high liftover.
Exterior StylingThe no-nonsense look of the 2016 Challenger links to the past and the muscle-car era, yet with a modern, sleeker twist. But no doubt; there’s an unmistakable family link to the Challengers that scorched boulevards, highways and racetracks back in the day. The long-hood, short-deck delivers a classic proportion, the rake is just right and SRT models get a cold-air intake on the hood. You can even get it in some of the colors of back in the day, as well, except, back in that earlier day, the cars were never, not ever, this good.
Favorite Features707-HORSEPOWER HELLCATHow could this not be a favorite feature? No Chevy Camaro or Ford Mustang ever cranked out 707 horsepower. If that’s too much, instead of the red key fob use the black one, which dials it back to a “mere” 500 horsepower. A Valet mode knocks it back even more.
NICE INTERIORA stylish instrumental panel has all the important functional and informational stuff angled at the driver. The front seats are comfortable, and adults can, indeed, sit in the back seat and everything looks terrific and operates well. A nice place for a drive.
Standard FeaturesThe 2016 Dodge Challenger base SXT model has a V6 engine, Uconnect infotainment with a 5.0-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, a USB and auxiliary input, six speakers, 6-way-power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, dual-zone automatic climate control, remote start (with automatic transmission) and a host of additional convenience and trim features. Since there are 10 different trim levels, there are really 10 different lists for “standard equipment,” and the higher-up models are quite generously appointed.
Factory OptionsMost of the 2016 Challenger’s options are grouped either by the 10 trim levels or into the 13 packages. One significant stand-alone option is the Uconnect 8.4AN, with an 8.4-inch touch screen, navigation, AM/FM/HD radio, SiriusXM radio, Bluetooth, Uconnect Access, SiriusXM Traffic and SiriusXM Travel Link and Uconnect apps; this is one all-inclusive feature we heartily recommend you consider. Other options include the R/T Classic Package, Technology Group, three Sound Groups, a Super Sport Group, a Super Track Pak Group and the Scat Pack Appearance Group, complete with Bumble Bee rear stripes. Who can forget those?
Engine & TransmissionStandard on 2016 Challenger SXT models is the 3.6-liter V6, making 305 horsepower. Next up is the 5.7-liter Hemi in R/T models, which makes 375 horsepower with a 6-speed manual transmission or 372 with the 8-speed automatic. The 392 Hemi Scat Pack and Challenger SRT 392 share the same 485-horsepower 6.4-liter V8. Then there’s the SRT Hellcat, with its supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 putting out 707 horsepower; if you want horsepower bragging rights in any crowd, and particularly under $100 grand, nothing beats the Hellcat. Available with all V8 engines is a 6-speed manual gearbox, which will be a favorite with 3-pedal drivers, but the 8-speed automatic is a quick-shifting delight that doesn’t shortchange on performance.

Check the color charts.
The 2016 Dodge Challenger blends classic muscle-car flavor with computer-age technology and performance. The take-no-prisoners styling is clearly linked to a glorious past of American big-engine performance, yet inside and under the hood are technological benefits and performance levels that were only wild dreams in the best days of the muscle-car era. There are four outstanding engines: a 3.6-liter, 305-horsepower V6 and three Hemi V8s; a 5.7-liter with 372 horsepower, a 6.4-liter of 485 horsepower and a 6.2-liter supercharged version in the SRT Hellcat that makes a staggering 707 horsepower. No Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro has ever matched that lofty peak, and this much is undisputed: There has never been a muscle car like this.

But, for those who like to minimize compromises, the Yukon, Yukon XL and Denali models are as close to compromise exterminators as it gets.","ConsGMC’s Yukon is really big, not for the budget-minded, difficult to maneuver in tight spots and uses gas. It should be pretty clear if this vehicle is a good choice for you – or not.",49000,"Driving the Used 2016 GMC YukonConsidering the Yukon XL weighs in the neighborhood of three tons, the driving experience is not at all “truck-like” but feels more like a luxury car that just happens to be really big. The engineers have shown that science works, and the Yukon delivers a quiet, even posh ride quality along with steering feel and handling response that are way beyond expectations. In SLE and SLT trim levels the Yukon is the mechanical twin of the Chevrolet Suburban, with a 5.3-liter V8 of 355 horsepower. But the Denali makes a huge jump with the 6.2-liter V8 of 420 horsepower, and Magnetic Ride Control, with shock absorbers that continually monitor road conditions and adjust themselves accordingly. Inside, it’s all luxury, all the time. Added up, the 2016 Yukon is a great ride, whether winding through the mountains to that weekend cabin or pulling a big trailer from sunrise to sunset.
Interior ComfortStepping inside the 2016 GMC Yukon, particularly the Denali, will quickly inform the owner that this purchase was money well spent. The artful and flowing shapes are enticing, materials are first-rate, the control layout is easily accommodating and detailing is impeccable. The seats look invitingly comfortable and are, and the second row offers space for full-size adults. In the Yukon the third row is best for the kids but, in the longer XL, there’s room for grown-ups. Those 3rd-row seats fold flat into the floor, for more cargo space. The Ford, Nissan and Toyota competitors are arguing over second place.
Exterior StylingFor years GMC SUVs have been styled as if they were passenger-carrying versions of the brand’s Sierra pickups. No more. Thankfully, the Yukon gets its own face, and a bold one it is. The non-Denali and Denali models share the same sheetmetal, but Denali versions have an upscale chrome mesh grille. For all Yukons, it’s an in-your-face look that will not be mistaken in the corporate officers’ parking lot, and a good dose of chrome adds the scent of money.
Favorite FeaturesLUXURIOUS INTERIOR Okay, so all upper-end SUVs have nice interiors and offer acres of leather. But the new Yukon Denali’s sumptuous inside takes a back seat to nobody. It’s stylish, pleasing, accommodating, comfortable and versatile, and tells the occupants they should feel glad to be here.
6.2-LITER V8Standard in the Yukon Denali is GM’s prodigious 6.2-liter V8. With 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, it takes no guff from any road or load. Sure, it’s not easy on gas, but there may not be a more capable, proven powerplant in any SUV on the market.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2016 GMC Yukon SLE offers more standard features than the Chevy Tahoe LS, but it’s also more expensive. The standard-equipment list on all Yukons includes front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, and IntelliLink, with an 8-inch-diagonal touch screen, AM/FM/SiriusXM, Bluetooth streaming audio and a host of other features. The SLT adds leather seats, power-folding 2nd- and 3rd-row seats, the Enhanced Security Package, a hands-free liftgate and numerous convenience items. The Denali adds the 6.2-liter V8, an upgraded interior and exterior trim, Magnetic Ride Control and no small amount of on-road respect.
Factory OptionsThe new Yukon is one of the few vehicles still available with a front bench seat, giving nine seating positions. Yukon XL models are available with the Open Road Package, at $3,355, which includes navigation, rear-seat entertainment, a power sunroof and additional SiriusXM service; the sunroof by itself is $995. For $3,165 the Denali offers a Premium Package, which includes a Head Up Display, illuminated power-retractable assist steps and Adaptive Cruise Control with front automatic braking. The rear-seat DVD entertainment system as a stand-alone option is $2,095. There is also a wide selection of wheels, up to 22 inches.
Engine & TransmissionAs standard equipment 2016 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL models have a 5.3-liter V8 of 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The highly appealing Denali has a take-no-prisoners 6.2-liter V8 of 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Both engines feature the efficiency benefits of direct gasoline injection and Active Cylinder Management, which seamlessly shuts off half the cylinders during steady cruising. Even with these efficiency-enhancing technologies, all Yukons are big vehicles and, therefore, are decidedly not gas-savers. Still, the engines are strong, capable and well-proven, and will get the jobs done. All Yukons and Denalis can be 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive (2WD, 4WD), the latter with an off-road-appropriate low range.

What's New?Marking its 6th generation, the Ford Mustang is all new for 2015. It features a fresh-yet-familiar exterior design, a revamped interior, and a new engine choice in the 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that actually makes more power than the standard V6.
With the arrival of the 2015 Mustang, Ford has successfully reinvented an icon. After 50 years of production, America’s venerated ponycar has been revamped for modern times to raise the stakes among rivals like the Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger. Gone is the archaic live rear axle, replaced by an all-new independent rear suspension and interior amenities fit for a premium car. And while some will scoff, the 2015 Ford Mustang is available with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in addition to the standard V6 or the GT’s growling V8. Yet for all its updating, the Mustang coupe and convertible retain the power, value and dashing driving manners that have fostered 9-million-plus sales over half a century and countless more fans.
Used 2015 Ford Mustang PricingThe 2015 Ford Mustang coupe has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $24,425 – an enticing proposition for buyers on a budget seeking a 300-horsepower performance car. EcoBoost Mustang models with the more-powerful 2.3-liter turbocharged engine begin just shy of $26,000, while the new Mustang GT debuts around $33,000. The 2015 Mustang convertible starts just under $30,000 for a V6 version. A loaded Mustang GT coupe can reach the mid-$40,000 range, while a loaded Mustang GT convertible nearly kisses $50,000. The new Mustang’s prices are in line with those of the Chevy Camaro, which starts at $24,700, while its starting price is well under that of the Dodge Challenger’s $27,990 admission price. To get the best deal, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price before buying. Since the 2015 Mustang is all-new, our number crunchers have yet to predict its resale value.
Driving the Used 2015 Ford MustangThe new Mustang handles far better than past models. And we’re not just talking about livelier cornering. The new independent rear suspension makes Ford’s ponycar more nimble than its live-axle predecessors. But just as important as performance, the Mustang’s new setup is more comfortable in everyday driving. In our tests, a passenger could even apply makeup without smearing. All Mustangs are quick, we just wish that the 310-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder version sounded more muscular. Not so for the 435-horsepower 5.0-liter V8 GT, which packs an auditory punch, and enough power to pin you to your seat. But even the 300-horsepower V6 model is a solid choice for most buyers. 2015 Mustangs with the 6-speed automatic transmission come with paddles for manual shifting, and feature downshift rev-matching for smoother transitions. We’re even more impressed with the revised 6-speed manual transmission – with short throws and a solid feel, it makes the new Mustang all the more satisfying.
Interior ComfortThe 6th-generation Mustang’s interior is appealing and functional, especially if you step up to a premium trim. Modern yet retro, Ford’s newest ponycar boasts easy-to-reach audio/climate controls, sturdy switches and comfortable front seats. The new Mustang distinguishes itself with a dash badge commemorating the model’s 50th anniversary. The two rear seats are tight for adults, especially in headroom. Trunk cargo space is better than expected – 13.5 cubic feet in coupes, 11.4 in convertibles – and the rear seats fold flat to accommodate longer items. In convertible Mustangs, only one hand is needed to release the latch for the power-operated soft top.
Exterior StylingBe ready to garner attention in your new Mustang. It’s easy to see why: The 2015 Mustang simply looks fantastic. At once immediately recognizable as a Mustang thanks to its long hood, sloping fastback and tri-bar taillights, it’s also thoroughly modern with sleek lines, aggressive headlights and windswept design. Ford has nixed the ""hockey stick"" side contours in favor of sleeker creases, and the results are beautiful. In functional terms, 2.3-liter models have active grille shutters that can close to direct airflow around the car to enhance efficiency. Mustang convertibles have a fabric top that’s lined and insulated within.
Favorite FeaturesSAFETY SYSTEMSIt’s not just the Mustang’s looks and powertrain that have been overhauled. The new car now offers safety features such as blind-spot monitoring and forward collision alert, which actively monitor conditions to warn drivers of potential hazards. They cost extra, but instantly become priceless when they take action.
IT’S BURNOUT-READYIf you’re a Mustang 5.0 buyer, Ford’s betting you like to burn rubber. That’s why Mustang GTs allow – perhaps even encourage – drag-strip shenanigans. Manual-transmission models include launch control for maximum acceleration, while all 2015 Mustang GTs have the ""line-lock"" mode that locks the front brakes for standing burnouts.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Ford Mustang coupe and convertible come in three major trims: V6, EcoBoost and GT. A base V6 model includes push-button start, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio with an auxiliary input, rearview camera, Ford’s Sync communication and entertainment system, high-intensity headlights, 17-inch wheels, and selectable-effort power steering. Also standard is Track Apps, which displays performance metrics such as acceleration times. EcoBoost models include the 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, 6-way power front seats and 18-inch wheels. GT models include the 5.0-liter V8, 19-inch wheels, the line-lock feature, and launch control on manual-transmission models.
Factory OptionsThere are many ways to make your new Mustang perform better, be more comfortable, or simply look meaner. Base V6 models can be had with a 6-speed automatic transmission, power front seats, parking sensors, and 18-inch wheels. EcoBoost and top-line GT models offer a 12-speaker Shaker audio system, navigation, leather seats and safety features such as blind-spot monitoring and forward collision alert. Adaptive cruise control is also now available on Ford’s 4-seat performance car, as are heated and cooled front seats and performance packages. EcoBoost and GT models are available with a 50th anniversary package with leather seats and commemorative badges.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available in the 2015 Ford Mustang. The base V6 Mustang comes with – surprise! – Ford’s carryover 3.7-liter V6 making 300 horsepower, while the top-line GT uses a revamped 5.0-liter V8 that now makes 435 horsepower. The newest member of the Mustang engine family is a 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 310 horsepower. As the smallest engine in the lineup, it’s also the most fuel efficient, garnering up to 32 mpg. Those peak power ratings, by the way, are obtained using 93 octane, though all the engines can run on regular unleaded if you don’t want to spring for the pricier stuff. All Mustangs are rear-wheel drive and can be fitted with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission.

Don’t need quite as much truck? Chevy has just introduced an all-new Colorado midsize pickup.",27000,"Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabTrucks aren’t usually known for their hushed cabins, but the Chevy Silverado’s engineers put great effort into sound isolation and their work has paid off. Road and wind noise are nicely quelled at highway speeds, while this full-size truck’s suspension soaks up everything short of a sinkhole. Steering is light and precise, with responsiveness that belies the Silverado’s portly dimensions. As the smallest of the Silverado’s engine choices, the base V6 provides only adequate power for acceleration and light-hauling duties. If you tow loads in excess of 5,000 pounds, we recommend the 5.3-liter V8. For even bigger tasks, the 6.2-liter V8 is rated to tow up to 12,000 pounds. The standard 6-speed automatic transmission in V6 and 5.3-liter V8 models does an admirable job of keeping power on tap, especially with the well-calibrated tow/haul mode engaged. Lastly, while the pedal feels a bit spongy, the brakes themselves provide more than enough pucker power.
Interior ComfortYou don’t need to spend $50,000 on a new Chevy Silverado to appreciate its interior – but if you do, you’re in for a treat. Even lower trims are nicely laid out and offer ample storage. Base versions do have plastic, but it’s well-textured for a better look and feel. Push-button controls handle most functions, and the ergonomic center stack keeps the touch screen within arm’s reach. Passenger capacity ranges from three in regular-cab models to five or six in double cabs and crew cabs. With up to five USB plugs, two 12-volt ports and a 110-volt outlet, the Silverado can juice several devices.
Exterior StylingEven with the new looks that came with the Silverado for last year’s revamp, it’s still recognizable as Chevy’s full-size truck thanks to its blocky design. The 2015 Silverado is available as a regular cab with a 6-foot 6-inch or 8-foot bed, a double cab with a 6-foot-6 bed or the larger crew cab with a 5-foot 8-inch or 6-foot-6 bed. As we mentioned, one of our favorite features is the CornerStep bumper that’s standard on all models except the top-line High Country that allows better access to the bed. Available LED bed lighting, meanwhile, helps you work in the dark.
Favorite FeaturesMYLINK INFOTAINMENTWhether you’re a smartphone aficionado or a rebellious technology holdout, Chevy’s 2nd-generation MyLink system is quite possibly the most rewarding infotainment system money can buy. Features like mobile application support, real-time data widgets and one-shot destination entry (speak an entire address at once) deliver connectivity without complexity.
CORNERSTEP BUMPERAs author William Golding once said, “The greatest ideas are the simplest.” This wisdom holds true in the automotive world, and the Silverado’s new CornerStep bumper is a prime example. The feature allows for easy access to the cargo bed by way of footholds integrated into the rear bumper.
Standard FeaturesIf you spend the least on a base Silverado WT work truck model, you’ll still get basics like air conditioning, power windows, cruise control and AM/FM audio system with 4.2-inch display and inputs for USB, auxiliary jack and SD card. The volume-leading LT adds the EZ-Lift tailgate, cloth seating with locking under-seat storage and 17-inch aluminum wheels. LTZ trims add the 5.3-liter V8 engine, heated leather seats with 10-way driver and outboard passenger adjustment, MyLink infotainment system with 8-inch touch screen with rearview camera, and automatic locking rear differential. All new Silverados also include two years/24,000 miles of complimentary factory-scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsIf you go full-boat on a Silverado High Country model, you’ll be treated to premium leather seats that are heated and ventilated up front, front and rear park assist, Bose premium audio system with navigation, and 20-inch chrome wheels. The Silverado’s options vary by trim and include navigation system, 4-wheel drive, cargo box lighting and the Z71 off-road package. The LT Convenience Package delivers a good balance between necessity and price, offering a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a 10-way power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control and a rearview camera. Standout safety options on higher trims include forward collision alert and lane-departure warning.
Engine & TransmissionBuyers have a choice of three engines in the 2015 Silverado. Lower models come with GM’s 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6, while the 5.3-liter V8 powers higher trims. For those requiring serious oomph in their half-ton Chevy pickup, there’s the 6.2-liter V8. All the engines can be paired with 4-wheel drive (4WD) in lieu of the standard 2-wheel-drive (2WD) setup. The V6 and 5.3-liter V8 are connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the big 6.2-liter V8 uses a new 8-speed transmission. All three of the engines run on regular unleaded, and the V6 and 5.3-liter V8 are flex-fuel compliant, meaning they can use the E85 ethanol blend.

Just off a head-to-toe revamp last year, the 2015 Chevrolet Silverado is a competent competitor in the fierce full-size truck segment. Available with a trio of engine choices and a variety of configurations and trims that range from a basic work truck to a leather-embellished upscale hauler, the Silverado can suit a variety of needs and tastes. Chevy’s full-size truck stands out from competitors such as the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra with a hushed cabin and a suite of available tech features that includes in-vehicle Wi-Fi, seats that vibrate to alert the driver of danger and the new Siri Eyes Free feature. While the Silverado’s fuel-economy ratings aren’t dazzling, Chevy’s truck satisfies with a blend of capability and civility.

Driving the Used 2015 Honda CivicThe Honda Civic isn’t unique in that it tries to be all things to all buyers. However, the fact that it comes so close to achieving that goal is pretty remarkable. Want an inexpensive, fuel-sipping commuter? Then the Civic’s solid road manners and excellent fuel economy are just what the doctor ordered. Want something that’ll give you a little more driving pleasure, then surprise, the Civic manages that just as well. With sharp steering, solid brakes, and a stiff structure, the Civic can hang with the best of them, making you think that it’s really a compact sport sedan. The continuously variable automatic transmission introduced last year is one of the best in any class, and even though the engine gets loud at high revs, it’s a complaint that’s hardly unique to the Civic. Of course, you could just skip it altogether and get the excellent manual transmission.
Interior ComfortThe Civic’s split-level dash isn’t new anymore, but it’s still a love-it-or-hate-it proposition. Unconventional dash aside, the Civic still offers up excellent interior space, interior storage and outward visibility. Honda has provided cubby holes and storage spaces just about everywhere, and everything is easy to find, too. Regardless of what you think about its design, the dash displays everything you need to know clearly and up-front, while the rest of the controls are easy to reach and use. Soft-touch materials on the instrument panel and upper door trim help give the Civic’s interior a more upscale feel.
Exterior StylingThe Honda Civic has come a long way since this generation’s 2012 introduction, with updates that turned what was a bland, uninspiring coupe and sedan into something with considerably more visual pizzazz. Sedans offer an upscale appearance, with a chrome grille, chrome accents on the trunk lid, and other touches. The coupe takes on a sportier appearance, with a sleek nose, big fog-light openings, and a slick profile. Civic Si models add bigger wheels and even sportier body work, while Hybrid models sport a unique grille and wheels.
Favorite FeaturesLANEWATCH BLIND-SPOT DISPLAYThe EX, EX-L and new Honda Civic SE get standard LaneWatch, a cool camera mounted under the passenger side mirror that displays what’s next to you on the center display screen, either when you use the right turn signal, or use the button on the tip of the signal stalk.
7-INCH DISPLAY AUDIOThe 2015 Honda Civic’s Display Audio touch-screen system pairs easily with an iPhone, and includes Siri EyesFree, allowing drivers to use their Apple smartphone’s voice commands even easier. The included HondaLink can deliver news, social media and apps connection like Pandora, while models with navigation can get traffic alerts.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2015 Honda Civic LX comes standard with Bluetooth, integrated Pandora Internet radio, a USB port, and a 5-inch full-color multi-information display that includes a rearview camera. The new Civic SE model adds Honda’s LaneWatch side-view monitor, automatic climate control, an upgraded audio system, and 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, while the mid-level EX adds a power moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, and keyless entry with push-button start. The range-topping EX-L adds leather upholstery, heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Civic Si models offer a much more powerful engine, while the Civic Hybrid includes a Forward Collision Warning system.
Factory OptionsHonda doesn’t offer option packages, instead bundling desirable features into separate trim levels. For example, leather upholstery is a separate trim level – Civic EX-L – while the touch-screen navigation system is another trim level above that: Civic EX-L with Navigation. Other available trim levels include the Civic HX, which offers a specially tuned engine and transmission to optimize fuel economy, and the Civic Hybrid for even better fuel efficiency – both of which are available in sedan form. The sporty Civic Si comes as a coupe or sedan with a sport-tuned suspension, a powerful engine and a 6-speed manual transmission.
Engine & TransmissionWe appreciate the simplicity of the Honda Civic’s drivetrain setup. The main engine is a 1.8-liter 143-horsepower 4-cylinder, connected to either a continuously variable automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual in some models. Despite the lack of turbochargers or other high-tech gizmos, the 1.8 offers excellent fuel economy and plenty of power. For better fuel economy you can step up to the Civic Hybrid, which sandwiches an electric motor between the 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and its CVT for a little extra electrical assist, even though it’s not capable of running solely on electrical power like a Toyota Prius. The Civic Si adds a 2.4-liter 205-horsepower 4-cylinder and a 6-speed manual transmission. Available in select markets, the Civic GX runs on compressed natural gas.

SE trim added to 2015 Civic sedan lineup, slotting between LX and EX models

The 2015 Honda Civic adds a new Special Edition model, slotting between the base LX and more lavish EX models. It includes higher-end items like Honda’s LaneWatch right-side-view camera, automatic climate control, and the EX’s Display Audio. The Civic SE comes in sedan only, and just with the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) introduced last year. It gives Civic buyers another option, bolstering Honda’s compact against the likes of the most formidable competition it’s ever faced. Be it the Ford Focus, Chevrolet Cruze, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, or longtime rival Toyota Corolla, the compact car market is tougher than ever. With its broad array of choices and fuel-efficient powertrains, however, the Civic remains a strong contender.

The Trailhawk is only available in 4-wheel drive (4WD), while the other models can be had in front-wheel drive only. As you might expect from something that competes with a Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, a front-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee is perfectly acceptable on the road around town. The 4-cylinder offers up adequate acceleration, while the power-hungry will prefer the V6. Yet order one of the three available 4WD systems and head off-road, and the Cherokee’s character changes. The standard Selec-Terrain traction-control system allows drivers to choose settings for Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and Rock, optimizing performance. An ""Auto"" setting uses sensors to choose for you, and all Cherokee models offer good approach and departure angles plus reasonable ground clearance, while the off-road optimized Trailhawk version ups the ante in each department.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Jeep Cherokee interior blends traditional Jeep cues – such as the trapezoidal ""center stack"" – with modern touches to create an attractive and upscale layout. The seats offer up good support, and come trimmed in either attractive cloth or soft Nappa leather. The heated and ventilated top-of-the-line seats also come with power adjustments and memory. The 2nd-row seats adjust forward and backward for better legroom, and split 60/40 for maximum cargo flexibility. We were particularly fond of the available wireless-device charging pad, plus the enormous glovebox. However, we do wish the Cherokee offered more room overall inside.
Exterior StylingPolarizing is the best way to sum up the 2015 Jeep Cherokee’s exterior. It’s one thing to stray from the traditional Jeep design aesthetic of round headlights flanking a 7-slot grille, but quite another to ditch the appearance of headlights entirely. However, we’ve warmed up to the new Jeep Cherokee, and there’s a lot here that says Jeep. The 7-slot grille has a ""kink"" folding it into the hood, and the less-controversial rear resembles the Grand Cherokee SUV. Trailhawk versions kick up the macho with a higher ride, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear treatments.
Favorite Features9-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONCredit German transmission manufacturer ZF for the near-magical packaging that lead to the 9-speed automatic used in the Jeep Cherokee. Even better, it all works, offering smooth launches and excellent power delivery, plus fuel economy from the V6 that’s as good as some competitors’ 4-cylinder engines.
SELEC-TERRAINPart of the off-road prowess offered by the Jeep Cherokee is due to the Selec-Terrain system. It uses up to 12 different vehicle systems, including the drivetrain control module, electronic brake controller, electronic stability control, transmission, and powertrain controller to ensure maximum traction.
Standard FeaturesAll Jeep Cherokee SUVs come standard with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, offering very good fuel economy and a range of about 500 miles on a tank of gasoline. Other standard equipment includes a Uconnect 5-inch touch-screen media center that includes Bluetooth, USB, SD and auxiliary ports. Also standard are a 3.5-inch full-color center display, 10 air bags, electronic stability control, traction control, Hill-start Assist, electric power steering, and an electric parking brake, plus cruise control, air conditioning with rear outlets, and remote keyless entry. The Jeep Cargo Management system includes standard hooks and a storage tote.
Factory OptionsJeep Cherokee Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk models can get the 3.2-liter Pentastar V6 engine. There are three all-wheel-drive systems available as well: Active Drive I, Active Drive II, and, on Trailhawk models, Active Drive Lock. Other upgrades include an 8.4-inch touch screen for Uconnect, an Alpine premium audio with nine speakers and a subwoofer, and a CommandView dual-pane panoramic sunroof with power sunshade. Cherokee Limited models add leather, heated power seats and steering wheel, Keyless Enter-N-Go, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Trailhawk models emphasize off-road capabilities with skidplates, an increased ride height, and a more rugged look.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine for 2015 Jeep Cherokee models is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine offering 184 horsepower. However, unlike many of its competitors, Jeep offers a V6 engine in its small SUV as well: a 3.2-liter V6 with 271 horsepower, and the added ability to tow up to 4,500 pounds. Both engines offer good fuel economy, with the 4-cylinder obviously being the fuel-sipper’s choice. Both engines come with a 9-speed automatic transmission, whether equipped with front-drive or 4-wheel drive. Three different 4-wheel-drive systems are available, ranging from the Jeep Active Drive I and Jeep Active Drive II, to the aggressive Jeep Active Drive Lock reserved for the off-road ready Trailhawk. V6 models get a modest fuel economy bump thanks to the new-for-2015 standard start-stop mechanism.

Forward Collision Warning is now available, a backup camera is standard on Latitude, Altitude, Limited and Trailhawk models, and a new SafetyTec option package bundles various electronic aids for Latitude, Altitude, Limited and Trailhawk models.
It’s not surprising that off-road prowess is the ace-in-the-hole the 2015 Jeep Cherokee SUV boasts over rivals like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. After all, Jeep, more than any other SUV manufacturer, has a reputation to uphold. Yet the really surprising thing is that despite its off-road capability – especially the Trailhawk – the 2015 Jeep Cherokee gives up nothing on-pavement, where most drivers will spend their time. Offering a low-range and three different 4-wheel-drive systems that give it uncanny rock crawling ability for a small crossover SUV, the Jeep Cherokee also offers creature comforts that put it at the head of the class. Jeep tops it off with an available V6 engine and a class-exclusive a 9-speed automatic transmission.

Credit the extensive use of aluminum in the A5’s structure, which helps keep the weight to a reasonable level, while simultaneously ensuring a rigid chassis. If you want more than the A5’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder can deliver, the S5 Coupe offers a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine and quattro all-wheel drive, delivering blistering speed and over-the-road competence, but in a way that’s accessible even if you’re not an expert racing driver. If that’s not enough, the RS 5 offers a 450-horsepower V8 engine, certain to grab and hold your attention.
Interior ComfortInterior design is often a compromise between form vs. function. Yet somehow, Audi has managed to blend striking design with easy day-to-day usability. In front are leather seats, offering excellent support without sacrificing accessibility, while the driver-oriented gauge cluster and center stack lend a sporty feel. The S5 ups the luxury and sport quotient, with Nappa leather and a selection of different dash inlays, including carbon fiber, brushed aluminum, stainless steel or gray birch. While Audi’s MMI system works well, and the other controls are easy to use, what really sets this interior apart are design and exquisite attention to detail.
Exterior StylingAudi’s combination of an oversize grille and sleek, flowing lines creates a design that stands out without looking forced or overbearing, and the 2015 A5 Coupe is a fitting poster child for the brand’s design aesthetic. The bold grille and LED headlight accents create an unmistakable face, while the finely tailored sheet metal, expressive fenders and sleek profile give the A5 an undeniable distinction. The lovely flowing curves along the sides, precise creases and crisp detailing finish it off perfectly.
Favorite Features3.0-LITER SUPERCHARGED V6All the engines in the A5 lineup are terrific, but we really like the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 in the S5, with 333 horsepower, 325 lb-ft of torque, snappy response, silky smoothness and commendable fuel economy. With either the 6-speed manual transmission or 8-speed Tiptronic automatic, it suits the S5 perfectly.
SUPERMODEL EXTERIORIn case we haven’t said it enough already, we love the way the Audi A5 looks. Still fresh even though it first hit the road in the 2007, its stunning good looks are one of the major reasons for considering the purchase.
Standard FeaturesThe standard Audi A5 comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and quattro AWD. There’s also 3-zone automatic climate control, tilt/telescope steering wheel, a panoramic sunroof, and 10-way adjustable power leather seats. The 10-speaker audio system includes Bluetooth and iPod integration, and the standard A5 even comes with automatic headlights and windshield wipers. Audi S5 models add Alcantara seating, keyless entry and ignition, and of course a supercharged V6 engine. The high-performance RS 5 models replace that with a V8 engine, unique front and rear styling treatments, and the ability to inspire envious stares wherever you go.
Factory OptionsOption packages include high-intensity-discharge headlights and LED taillights, an S line competition package that adds black exterior mirrors and Alcantara interior to the A5, and a variety of wheel packages. Navigation is a stand-alone option, which many buyers may appreciate, although including Audi Connect allows searches using Google Earth, providing realistic terrain imagery, as well as the ability to send destinations from any browser directly to the car. The Black Optic Plus Package includes 20-inch wheels on A5 and S5 models, and a carbon-fiber engine cover on RS 5 models.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that’s standard in the Audi A5 is as good as it gets for a ""base"" engine, especially with 220 smooth horsepower, standard front-wheel drive (FWD) or quattro AWD, and your choice of a 6-speed automatic or an 8-speed automatic with Tiptronic manual control. However, we’re particularly fond of the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 in the Audi S5, with its 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. If that’s not enough, and you don’t mind a fuel-economy penalty, the RS 5’s 4.2-liter normally aspirated V8 puts out 450 horsepower. Maybe it’s a little old-school, but really, who cares?

Automotive history is filled with cars that are beautiful to behold, but not so nice to drive. The 2015 Audi A5 is a noteworthy exception, because this high-performance luxury coupe is just as thrilling to drivers as it is to oglers. The exterior and interior styling belong in a museum of fine art. Yet from behind the steering wheel, the A5 coupe and convertible are even better. Whether you’re driving the 220-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder, the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 of the S5 with 333 horsepower, or the 4.2-liter V8 of the RS 5 with 450 horsepower, there’s plenty of power in reserve. Ride, handling, braking, steering and over-the-road manners are everything you might expect, and Audi’s quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) makes short work of inclement weather.

The standard 8-speed automatic transmission doesn’t hunt for gears, and ride noise is kept at a manageable level. Navigating through traffic is fun in a Hellcat-equipped Charger with its endless power on tap. Overall, the new Charger’s ride is compliant and comfortable, and it’s easy to talk with passengers without having to compete with the radio.
Interior ComfortBeing all-new for 2015, obvious changes over the previous model include a new 7-inch customizable gauge cluster, a redesigned instrument cluster and a new electronic shifter. The Uconnect infotainment system and an available 8.4-inch touch screen – two features we highly recommend springing for – return for the 2015 model year. The seats are comfortable and can handle long road trips with ease. The steering wheel has been redesigned to match the rest in the Chrysler Group (sans logo in the center) but the audio controls are still on the back of the spokes.
Exterior StylingThe hood, front doors, spoiler, taillights and front fascia have all been redesigned for the 2015 model year. Obvious changes include the new grille and headlights, which have been repositioned to help with engine airflow. This design also gives the new Charger a low, aggressive stance, and the newly rounded-off rear end continues to feature Dodge’s touted “racetrack” taillights.

6.2-LITER HELLCAT SUPERCHARGED V8Rated at 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, the all-new 6.2-liter Hellcat supercharged V8 engine is the most powerful engine Chrysler Group has ever rolled out. Compared to other vehicles that offer similar power numbers (BMW M5, Porsche Panamera, Ferrari F12berlinetta), the new Charger SRT Hellcat is the deal of this century and possible even the next one, too.
Standard FeaturesLED daytime running lights, acoustic front glass and windshield, front and rear power windows with express front up/down, and a configurable, full color, 7-inch driver information display are all standard features on the 2015 Dodge Charger.
Factory OptionsGoing right to the top Charger trim, the SRT Hellcat brings along a slew of features and more horsepower than most know what to do with. A starting price of $63,995 gets you the best features and engine the new Charger lineup has to offer including integrated dual black vapor chrome exhaust tips, a black grille with a performance mesh design, SRT Performance Pages within Uconnect, and a 200-mph analog speedometer. Then there’s the all-new 6.2-liter Hellcat supercharged V8 engine, which is rated at 707 horsepower.
Engine & TransmissionHere’s where the 2015 Charger really shines. You have four engine options available with horsepower spanning from 292 to an eye-watering 707. The base 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine is rated at 292 horsepower and can return 31 mpg on the highway. This is also the only engine available with all-wheel drive. If it’s more power you seek, you came to the right place as the Charger is available with three different variations of the V8 engine. The first is a 5.7-liter V8, rated at 370 horsepower, followed by a 6.4-liter V8, which churns out 485 horsepower. Then there’s the all-new Hellcat supercharged V8 engine, rated at 707 horsepower. Power for every new Charger is sent to the wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission.

All-new for 2015, the Dodge Charger takes the family sedan to a whole new level with its available 6.2-liter Hellcat supercharged V8 engine. Versatility is the name of the game as the new Charger offers a V6 (available with all-wheel drive) and three different V8 engines. Whether you’re driving the V6, which is quiet and fuel efficient, or the all-new Hellcat V8 – rated at 707 horsepower – other alternatives like the Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse don’t seem as interesting all of a sudden.

On the other end of the spectrum, you pay more than $26,000 for a fully loaded Impreza Sport Hatchback. That compares well against competitors like the Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra, Chevy Cruze and Ford Focus, none of which offer all-wheel drive. If you’re looking for performance, the WRX with a manual transmission starts around $27,000, while the base-level WRX STI starts at a little over $35,000. Spec out that STI and you’re looking at about $40,000 worth of high-performance compact sedan. That’s on par with the VW Golf R and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price will tell you what others are playing for the Subaru Impreza in your area. Resale value for the Impreza is predicted to hold up very well, above most competitors.
Driving the Used 2015 Subaru ImprezaSubaru has spent the past couple decades making its name synonymous with its patented Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system, offering it as standard on every car wearing the Subaru badge, except for the BRZ. This AWD system is always engaged, sending power to wherever it’s needed most and providing excellent traction on dry and wet pavement. Connected to the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), and while it may not be everyone’s favorite, it returns excellent fuel-economy numbers in spite of the added weight and complexity of the AWD system. If you need more punch, the WRX and WRX STI add turbocharged power to the mix, pumping up performance considerably, while maintaining good if not great fuel economy. Downsides to the WRX models are a harsher ride and a definite increase in on-road and engine noise.
Interior ComfortSome will appreciate the straightforward design of the 2015 Subaru Impreza. Others will just think it looks plain. Either way, the Impreza’s interior is easy to use, with the controls nicely labeled and handy. The exception would be the buttons for the front-seat heaters hidden below the driver’s-side armrest. There’s decent room for four adults inside, and cargo space is also generous, especially in hatchback models. If cloth isn’t your thing, the interior can be dressed in leather. Impreza WRX and STI models get unique seats and trim to match their sporting intentions.
Exterior StylingThe Subaru Impreza gets a new nose and tail this year, but not so different that you’d notice without putting it side-by-side with last year’s car. That’s okay though, as we’ve grown to like the conservatively attractive shape of the sedan. The 5-door hatchback’s humpback shape takes a little getting used to, but the available cargo racks are undeniably handy. The big news is the new WRX and STI models, which now boast a more aggressive version of the Impreza sedan’s body. It’s a big improvement, and we like the addition of the hood scoop, big tailpipes and aggressive wheels.
Favorite FeaturesFUEL ECONOMYIt’s hard to find a gasoline-powered AWD car with good fuel economy, but the 2015 Subaru Impreza manages this trick quite nicely. While not a class leader, it’s definitely competitive, offering up to 37 mpg on the highway.
TURBOCHARGED ENGINEOn the other end of the performance spectrum are the high-performance 2015 Impreza WRX and STI models. With 268 horsepower and 305 horsepower, respectively, the WRX and STI bring a blast of driving fun to this compact sedan.
Standard FeaturesThe non-turbo 2015 Subaru Impreza comes in 2.0i, 2.0i Premium and 2.0i Limited trim levels. The base Impreza 2.0i comes with a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, power windows and doors, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, keyless entry and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary and USB inputs and Bluetooth audio streaming. Moving up the ladder gets you the automatic transmission, leather seating, larger wheels, heated front seats, automatic climate control and an upgraded audio system. The wagon-only 2.0i Sport Premium and Sport Limited include 17-inch wheels and fog lights. WRX and STI models get stiffer suspensions and better brakes.
Factory OptionsThe CVT automatic transmission is available on all models, and we strongly recommend it for the fuel savings. Other options include a power moonroof, voice-activated navigation system with 6.1-inch touch screen, a cold-weather package with a de-icer for the windshield wipers, keyless entry and heated seats. Other cold-environment accessories include a battery warmer and engine-block heater. The WRX and STI performance models can be upgraded with satellite radio, short-throw shifter and turbo-boost gauge.
Engine & TransmissionStandard issue on 2015 Subaru Imprezas is a 148-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine connected to a 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. It’s a good little engine, as long as you’re not in a big hurry. The 2015 WRX gets a turbocharged version of that engine, putting out 268 horsepower, and can come with either a 6-speed manual or a version of the CVT automatic that’s in the standard Impreza. If that’s still not enough, the 2.5-liter, 305 horsepower 4-cylinder STI should do the trick. All three engines use what’s known as a ""boxer"" layout, in which the cylinders are horizontally opposed, two on each side. The design lowers the center of gravity, which improves handling.

Foremost among these are Magnetic Ride Control, available on the top-line LTZ trim levels. The system uses high-tech shock absorbers that can adjust their stiffness depending on road conditions, smoothing out rough surfaces while still preventing too much body lean in corners. ""Nimble"" is too strong a word, but ""carlike"" isn’t too far off. The new Suburban is quieter as well, and even at highway speeds we were able to maintain a conversation without a single ""What?"" or ""Speak up!"" The upgraded 5.3-liter V8 engine delivers enough power to make acceleration and passing afterthoughts, albeit at the expense of fuel economy in the low- to mid-teens. Then there’s parking: Chevy went to considerable lengths to make the Suburban more maneuverable, but its considerable length is always going make parking lots a challenge.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Suburban’s new upscale interior impresses from the moment you sit down, with sweeping curves, high-end materials, and excellent fit and finish making it look more like a luxury sedan than a full-size SUV. The second row’s comfortable seats recline, but unfortunately they don’t slide fore and aft. The third row has enough footroom and legroom for adults, at least for shorter drives; kids will be fine. A high cargo floor is required to ensure the new flat-fold third row. It’s not wasted space though – under the floor is a handy hidden storage area.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Chevy Suburban sports all-new sheet metal, and shares nothing with its pickup truck counterpart for the first time. This let Chevy’s stylists stretch their imaginations, literally when you consider how much SUV there is to style. The long lines emphasize the Suburban’s length instead of hiding it, and the broad grille makes this big family car look even wider than it really is. Dimensionally, the 2015 Suburban is about the same size as its predecessor – when you’re talking about a vehicle this big to begin with, an extra inch here or there doesn’t make much of a difference.
Favorite FeaturesMAGNETIC RIDE CONTROLTaming the ride characteristics of a 5,800-pound SUV is never easy, but Chevy’s Magnetic Ride Control keeps things on the level. The shocks sense road conditions as you drive, adjusting their stiffness to keep the ride smooth, but still control body lean in corners.
HAULINGWith nearly 40 cubic-feet of cargo space behind the third row, the Suburban is the cargo-hauling king of SUVs. Add to that up to 8,300 pounds of towing capacity – plus decent 3rd-row legroom – and you have a remarkably family-friendly cargo-hauler.
Standard FeaturesAll Suburban models come with the same 5.3-liter V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, and tons of interior space. Base level LS trims come with cloth seats, Bluetooth for phone and audio, automatic climate control, and rear parking sensors. Step up to the mid-range LT trim to get standard forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, standard Chevrolet MyLink infotainment, and Bose audio. Full-boat LTZ models add rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot alerts, Magnetic Ride Control, and 20-inch wheels, however you lose the option of a 2nd-row bench, with captain’s chairs the only available middle-row seating.
Factory OptionsThe 2015 Suburban can seat up to nine, if you get an LS trim with the optional front bench seat. Other options include a $2,705 Luxury Package for LT trims, which adds many of the LTZ’s luxury touches. A $395 theft protection package adds interior motion sensors, while the $3,305 Sun, Entertainment and Destinations package bundles navigation, a rear-seat entertainment system with Blu-ray, and a power sunroof on LT and LTZ trims. Various 22-inch wheels can be ordered for the LTZ, and later this year, you’ll be able to equip the Suburban as a wireless mobile hotspot using 4G LTE.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Chevrolet Suburban comes with only one engine this year: a 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8. The previous generation’s bigger engines have been dropped for the simple reason that very few people bought them. They won’t miss those thirstier powerplants though, as this V8 has been significantly upgraded. It features direct injection to improve fuel economy, and increase power and torque. It also has Active Cylinder Management, which imperceptibly shuts off half of the cylinders under certain circumstances to help save fuel. It comes connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and 4-wheel drive with a low range is available on all trim levels.

With all-new styling, interior and chassis, the 2015 Chevrolet Suburban is more than just a refresh, but a wholly modern vehicle that adds a huge helping of refinement. Already nearly in a class of its own – save for other GM versions – the new Suburban leapfrogs the Ford Expedition EL with a refined interior and exterior, and finally adds things like a cargo-friendly flat-folding third row. The big SUV also gets improved steering, and an available Magnetic Ride Control suspension helps it float over bumps large and small.

It should also be noted that the Skyactiv engine requires pricey synthetic oil with a 7,500-mile recommended change interval.",22000,"Driving the Used 2015 MAZDA MAZDA6We admit there were times during our test drive we wished for a V6 under the Mazda6’s hood. But, as most buyers in this segment opt for 4-cylinder engines, we feel the Mazda6’s 184-horsepower 2.5-liter offering will more than meet most expectations. Mazda’s ability to design the engine, body and suspension at the same time has created a car that is lighter and stronger than its competitors, and one that offers precise handling, excellent braking and a truly enjoyable driving experience. The fully electric power steering surprised us with its excellent feedback and relatively quick 15.5:1 ratio. As for overall ride comfort, we found the big 19-inch wheel and tire package on the Touring and Grand Touring to feel a bit harsh. Opting for the Sport trim brings smaller 17-inch wheels and a better ride, but fewer features we so love such as the Bose audio, automatic climate control and navigation.
Interior ComfortWe think the interior of the Mazda6 is among the most upscale in the segment. The dash sweeps gracefully from driver’s to passenger’s side. The driver is presented with a dense cluster of highly legible instruments, gauges and knobs. It’s a not-so-subtle bow to the car’s “driver orientation.” Another is the Mazda6’s small-diameter steering wheel that feels great to the touch. Well-bolstered 6- or 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seats are standard on all but the lowest trim level, which is equipped with a 6-way manually adjustable driver’s seat. Rear legroom is among the most generous in the midsize segment thanks in part to the car’s 111.4-inch wheelbase.
Exterior StylingThe Mazda6’s pretty face and voluptuous curves immediately capture the attention of midsize-car buyers, who too often are offered safe, conservative designs. Mazda designers took more chances by basing the new model on Mazda’s well-regarded Takeri concept vehicle. Among the important elements are the long hood, rearward-set windshield and muscular haunches over the rear wheels. The Mazda6 also echoes and refines the Takeri’s bold front end with its sweeping “wing,” prominent Mazda badge, and finely sculptured lower valance. From both front and rear, the emphasis is on width, giving the 2015 Mazda6 the curb presence of a more expensive car.
Favorite FeaturesSKYACTIV-G ENGINEThe 2.5-liter Skyactiv 4-cylinder has an insanely high 13:1 compression ratio that helps it deliver maximum power and fuel economy without the need for turbocharging.
I-ELOOP ENERGY CAPTUREMazda’s i-Eloop regenerative braking system employs a fast charging capacitor in place of a battery to capture and store electricity while the car is coasting. That energy is then used to power ancillary equipment.
Standard FeaturesThe entry-level I-Sport trim level is equipped with the Skyactiv-G 2.5-liter gasoline engine and Skyactiv-MT 6-speed manual transmission. It also offers 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels – the largest standard wheels in the competitive set – plus power-operated side-view mirrors and automatic headlight shutoff. Push-button start, cloth seats, power windows with 1-touch auto up/down, 60/40-split fold-down rear seats, cruise control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, steering wheel-mounted audio and cruise control functions, and air conditioning with a pollen filter are also standard features. The standard entertainment system is a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system that can deliver MP3/SiriusXM satellite radio reception.
Factory OptionsIn this era of connectivity, the Mazda6 offers a 5.8-inch in-dash touch screen that controls phone, audio and navigation functions. Other available features include Bluetooth connectivity and iPod audio with the familiar information accessible via the touch screen. Grand Touring models feature an 11-speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound System. When a smartphone is connected, text messages can be shown on the touch screen, and the system can voice the messages and allow users to send replies using fixed phrases. A speech recognition system allows users to search and manipulate audio tracks. The most interesting new bit of optional safety equipment is the Smart City Brake Support system designed to assist a driver in avoiding frontal collisions when traveling at speeds of less than 19 miles per hour.
Engine & TransmissionThe sole powerplant for the 2015 Mazda6 is the 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G gasoline engine. It features a radical 13:1 compression ratio for greater efficiency, facilitated by its unique exhaust manifold design that necessitated a new body structure. Equally innovative are the Skyactiv-MT 6-speed manual transmission and the Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic. The latter employs aspects of both torque-converter and dual-clutch transmissions to deliver both excellent low-speed feel and admirably quick shifts. The transmissions are lightweight and help the Mazda6 turn in segment-topping gasoline-only fuel economy. Best of all, the Mazda6 doesn’t require premium fuel.

Driven by Mazda’s Skyactiv engine technology, the Mazda6 is able to squeeze out impressive power from a mere 2.5-liter engine and return fuel economy figures that put some economy cars to shame. Mazda even offers a manual transmission on two of the Mazda6’s three trims, another nod to the enthusiast nature of the Mazda family of cars. Unfortunately, last year’s promise of a Skyactiv diesel looks to have been scrapped, with only a 2.5-liter gasoline-powered model offered for 2015.

The Toyota Camry and Honda Accord sedans both offer up more room for rear passengers.",23000,"Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet MalibuThe 2015 Chevrolet Malibu is a quiet, composed and competent sedan. Last year’s suspension improvements went a long way toward settling the car on the road, and when combined with the quiet ride, the result is a midsize sedan that’s well suited to long road trips over mile after mile of Interstate. The Malibu is also confident, if not exactly thrilling, on mountain roads too. The standard 4-cylinder engine offers decent power but only mid-pack fuel economy. The start-stop system added last year, which shuts off the engine at stoplights or in heavy stop-and-go traffic, is one of the best out there. The turbocharged Malibu offers notably more power and low-end torque, easily making the 4-cylinder competitive with the V6 engines available in other cars.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Malibu is a comfortable place to while away your time on the road. Despite being on the smaller end of the midsize-sedan market, the Malibu’s airy interior offers plenty of room for front passengers, and rear passengers as long as they’re ""tweens"" or younger. The design, plus chrome accents and available leather, feel upscale for the class. At speed, the Malibu is quiet compared to its competition, and the controls and gauges are easy to use and see. Trunk space is adequate, although it’s a high lift to the trunk compared to other sedans in the class.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Malibu carries over the new nose and tail it received last year. The design changes bring the Malibu closer to the larger Chevrolet Impala, one of the most handsome cars in its class. However, the distance between the front and rear wheels on the Malibu, known as wheelbase, is shorter than in other midsize sedans, giving it a somewhat awkward profile. Nonetheless, from other angles this is a handsome vehicle. We particularly like the taillights, inspired by performance cars like the Chevrolet Camaro, and the sporty stainless-steel exhaust tips on the top-line LTZ model.
Favorite Features4G LTE WI-FIThe Wi-Fi availability in the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu has the potential to be a game-changer in the midsize-sedan segment. The most obvious example is a long road trip, where the kids in back could stream Netflix as you drive down the Interstate.
MYLINK INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMChevy’s MyLink infotainment system is easy to use, and packed with features. You can use your Pandora and Stitcher accounts, Bluetooth sync is fast and easy, and everything’s displayed on a large 7-inch touch screen that opens to reveal a hidden storage compartment.
Standard FeaturesThe basic 2015 Chevrolet Malibu LS sedan comes with a 6-speaker audio with AM/FM/CD/satellite radio, cruise control, remote keyless entry, Bluetooth phone connectivity, and standard Wi-Fi connectivity, although it requires an OnStar subscription. The LT adds 7-inch touch screen with MyLink, a USB port for audio devices, Bluetooth audio streaming and a power driver’s seat. Top-line LTZ versions enhance comfort with a power passenger seat, heated front seats and leather upholstery. All 2015 Malibus have 10 airbags and a 6-month trial of GM’s OnStar safety and communications system, plus a 3-month 3GB data trial.
Factory OptionsOptional on 2015 Malibu LT and LTZ midsize sedans is the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, which adds quite a bit of punch over the standard 4-cylinder. Other available options include navigation, a power sunroof, a backup camera and leather seating. The Advanced Safety Package includes blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, and a rear cross-traffic alert. Those seeking a premium audio system can opt for a 9-speaker Pioneer setup.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Chevrolet Malibu offers two different engines to drive its front wheels. The first is the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, which comes standard with start-stop technology that shuts off the engine when the vehicle isn’t moving. The upgrade engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that offers up enough power that you’ll never wish for a V6. Both engines come with a 6-speed automatic transmission that includes a manual-shift mode, although the buttons mounted on top of the shift handle aren’t the easiest to use. As with most midsize sedans, all versions of the Malibu can run on regular unleaded gasoline, though premium is recommended for the turbo model.

Read Full Review","What's New?The biggest change to the 2015 Chevy Malibu is the addition of 4G LTE technology to OnStar. This allows the Malibu to act as a Wi-Fi hotspot, allowing computers, smartphones and tablets access to the Internet, as long as there’s a 4G connection.
Last year, Chevrolet upgraded the Malibu midsize sedan’s suspension for a more comfortable and controlled ride, improved rear-seat room (a little), and reshaped the nose a bit. Now, Chevy’s just having fun. The 2015 Chevrolet Malibu gets available 4G LTE with OnStar, the same high-speed wireless connection that’s probably on your smartphone. And, just like your phone, the 2015 Malibu can act as a wireless hotspot, allowing broadband Internet connections through tablets, smartphones, computers, or just about any other connected technology. Otherwise, with the exception of a few new colors, the 2015 Chevy Malibu is largely carryover, and that’s fine with us. We like the quiet and comfortable ride, and the Malibu remains one of the better looking sedans in its class, inside and out.

Those needing 3-row seating should look to the Nissan Rogue.",24000,"Driving the Used 2015 Ford EscapeWith the exception of the Mazda CX-5, there is no sportier compact crossover SUV than the Ford Escape. Ford wisely jettisoned its boxy and boring SUV formula in favor of a light, nimble and very European-looking compact. Its handling is precise and the available 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine puts out an impressive 240 horsepower. But even if you settle for the smaller 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine, the performance is still a cut above most compact SUVs. The Escape’s ride straddles the fence between comfortable and firm, and there is more noise in the cabin than in the Subaru Forester or Honda CR-V. But the experience from behind the wheel just can’t be matched by the aforementioned competitors, nor do they come close to matching the long list of electronic and audio upgrades offered by Ford.
Interior ComfortThe inside of the Ford Escape boasts an impressive display of materials, design and available features. The dash can feel a bit busy, especially when loaded up with options like MyFord Touch. If you’re not into lots of high tech, you might just want to avoid the top-end models. The seats are comfortable, but a bit on the narrow side, and the cargo space and rear-seat room are not as generous as in some of the Escape’s competition. However, we love the available panoramic moonroof as well as the excellent Sony audio system.
Exterior StylingLike some others in the compact-SUV segment now, the Ford Escape shows a strong sense of style. Exterior highlights that distinguish upper-tier Escape models include HID headlamps, fog lights, body-color mirrors and trim, dual chrome exhaust tips and big 19-inch wheels. Sadly, the Escape doesn’t offer any kind of forward-collision alert or adaptive cruise control feature, as found on the Subaru Forester. It can, however, warn of rear crossing traffic and parallel park itself.
Favorite FeaturesHANDS-FREE LIFTGATEAnyone who has ever approached a locked hatchback with arms full will appreciate this feature. Simply pass your foot beneath the rear bumper and the hatch automatically unlocks and powers itself open.
MYKEYKids love cars almost as much as their parents do. They also love to test the limits of common sense. That’s why Ford allows owners to program limits on the vehicle’s top speed, audio volume and, if seatbelts aren’t buckled, cut off the audio system altogether.
Standard FeaturesThe base Ford Escape S features a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/Aux sound system, air conditioning, audio and cruise controls on the steering wheel, the parent-friendly MyKey system, and a full complement of airbags and electronic safety features. Base-model compromises include covered steel wheels and black plastic exterior trim elements.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded Ford Escape Titanium comes with enough cool features to embarrass many luxury cars. In addition to a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, 4-wheel drive, leather seats and a panoramic moonroof, a top-tier Escape offers blind-spot warning, automatic parallel parking, an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation, Sync with MyFord Touch, and a liftgate that opens with a wave of your foot. You could get an Acura RDX for the same money, but you wouldn’t have as many fun features to play with.
Engine & TransmissionThe Ford Escape offers a choice of three engines (unique in the compact-SUV class). The 240-horsepower rating of the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine looks irresistible, but truthfully, the 178-horsepower 1.6-liter version is still plenty powerful, just as smooth, and more affordable and more efficient in the bargain. The base 2.5-liter engine would probably be fine for many owners but it comes only in the base Escape S, which doesn’t look so grand compared to some competitors. All three engines work with a responsive 6-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control, driving either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). If you want AWD you’ll have to choose one of the EcoBoost engines. And if you want the Escape’s full towing capacity of 3,500 pounds, that requires the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine (and note that the towing package eliminates the clever hands-free liftgate option).

Although there are dozens of compact SUVs from which to choose, few have the styling, performance and features offered by the 5-passenger 2015 Ford Escape. Beyond its cutting-edge engine options and handsome styling, the Escape offers nimble handling via its sport-tuned suspension and a plethora of electronics aimed at keeping tech-savvy consumers safely in touch with the world, even when in motion. You won’t find features like the foot-activated power rear liftgate or panoramic moonroof on the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, and you certainly won’t find a choice of two turbocharged engines. There are less expensive compact SUVs on the market, some even offer more interior space and better fuel economy, but the Ford Escape seems to have all the bases covered.

Generously accommodating and delightfully easy to use, the Toyota Sienna is about as minivan as minivans come. And it’s been made even better for 2015, with visual, functional and foundational upgrades that return the Sienna to the head of its class in several areas. It’s also the only minivan to offer available all-wheel drive, and its stellar reputation for long-term reliability helps it retain its value better than any other minivan. If you’re looking for a research shortcut to your next minivan, here it is: Buy a 2015 Toyota Sienna.
Used 2015 Toyota Sienna PricingA base 2015 Toyota Sienna L has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just shy of $30,000, including destination charges. On the other end of the Sienna spectrum, a fully loaded all-wheel-drive Limited model can top $47,000. Before buying, be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others are actually paying for the 2015 Sienna in your area. Down the road, the Toyota Sienna is expected to be the leader of the pack in terms of resale value.
Driving the Used 2015 Toyota SiennaAs part of its 2015 update, the Sienna is now put together with an additional 142 spot welds. It’s not something a new Sienna owner is likely to brag about to the neighbors, but the stiffer platform is part of the reason the 2015 Sienna is more satisfying to drive than the 2014 model. The familiar 266-horsepower V6 continues to deliver ample (if not subtle) power, while the 6-speed automatic transmission deftly manages that output. Responsive enough around town and now quieter on the highway, the Sienna is about as satisfying to drive as an 8-passenger troop transport can be, and it’s even more satisfying for passengers. For those seeking a more dialed-in driving experience, the SE trim offers a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch wheels. Both features improve handling but also result in a harsher ride and more road noise inside the cabin.
Interior ComfortInterior upgrades for the 2015 model year give the Sienna a more premium, more contemporary feel. A redesigned instrument cluster includes a new LCD information display, and the center stack has been reconfigured for a tidier look and easier operation. Available in 7- and 8-passenger configurations and with four child-safety-seat LATCH points (up from three in 2014), the Sienna also offers more cargo room behind the third row than any other minivan.
Exterior StylingSome of the KBB.com editors think the Sienna is the best-looking minivan on the market, and some think it’s downright stylish. Subtle design changes for 2015 include new grille, headlight and taillight designs, applied variably throughout the line. The sport-themed Sienna SE actually sits a bit lower and features side skirts that make it look lower still.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVEAs the only minivan in the segment able to put power to all four wheels, this option is the one to have if you regularly find yourself driving in snowy or slick conditions.
2ND-ROW LOUNGE SEATINGThe pair of leather-trimmed captain’s chairs available in XLE and Limited versions of the 2015 Sienna are a treat for 2nd-row passengers. In Limited models, the seats have a “long-slide” feature that makes them feel more akin to a living-room recliner complete with footrests.
Standard FeaturesA base 2015 Toyota Sienna L comes with a 6.1-inch touch-screen Entune infotainment system – with a USB input, Bluetooth connectivity and integrated backup camera – 3-zone air conditioning, cruise control, keyless entry, and six cup holders. In addition to eight airbags, the Sienna’s standard Star Safety System includes stability and traction control, brake assist and Toyota’s Smart Stop Technology, which helps halt the vehicle even if the accelerator is depressed.
Factory OptionsThe 2015 Toyota Sienna offers plenty of mouthwatering options, including an ultra-wide rear-seat entertainment system that can play two movies side by side (now Blu-ray capable for 2015), dual front/rear moonroof, blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, 2nd-row captain’s chairs with deployable footrests, and a variety of Entune infotainment upgrades ranging from premium JBL sound to integrated apps. The Sienna also offers the minivan-exclusive Driver Easy Speak function, which subtly amplifies the driver’s voice through the rear speakers. A radar-based pre-collision system and dynamic cruise control are available at the top of the range.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Toyota Sienna features a 3.5-liter V6 that makes 266 horsepower and delivers up to 25 mpg in conjunction with a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, with AWD optional. The 2014 Sienna’s towing capacity is 3,500 pounds.

If you need the space, but don’t need to tow heavy loads, a crossover SUV like the Ford Flex or Ford Explorer could be a better choice.",40000,"Driving the Used 2015 Ford ExpeditionThe addition of the EcoBoost V6 in the 2015 Ford Expedition promises to do two things which were previously impossible to do simultaneously. First, it will definitely improve performance, thanks to an additional 55 horsepower and 55 lb-ft of torque. That torque comes on even lower in the rev range, sure to make this heavy beast feel more responsive, even if outright liveliness isn’t in the cards. It can still tow up to 9,200 pounds, despite the smaller engine. But while the engine may be getting the headlines, there’s more under the skin of the 2015 Expedition. The suspension, for example, now includes electronically controlled shock absorbers that not only help smooth out the ride, but give the driver the flexibility of three different driving modes: Comfort, Normal and Sport. The steering is now electrically boosted, further enhancing fuel economy.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Expedition’s interior revisions may not catch your eye at first, but they’re definitely noteworthy. MyFord Touch is nestled in the dash for the first time, bringing the Expedition into the rest of the Ford fold with its enhanced integration of smartphones, navigation and other technology. Opt for the new Platinum trim and you get soft leather in your choice of Brunello (red) or Agate (gray). All Expeditions have three rows of seats, and the rear two fold flat without compromising cargo space – especially in the longer EL models – thanks to the Expedition’s independent rear suspension.
Exterior StylingExterior updates to the 2015 Expedition do a lot with a little. The new nose incorporates revised headlights, an updated grille and relocated fog lights, while the rear gets new taillights. Otherwise, the basic boxy silhouette is unchanged. New for 2015 is a Platinum trim level for the first time, which incorporates chrome highlights and special wheels. As before, if the standard Expedition isn’t enough, there’s always the extra-long EL model, with 14 inches of additional length and more than 42 cubic feet of storage behind the third row.
Favorite FeaturesECOBOOSTThe days of the giant, fuel-thirsty V8 are numbered, at least, they are over at Ford. The 3.5-liter V6 puts out more power and torque than the 5.4-liter V8 it replaces, maintains the same towing capacity, and with history as a guide, will get better fuel economy.
MYFORD TOUCHWhile Ford’s infotainment system isn’t without its critics, there’s no denying it’s a big leap forward compared to the previous touch-screen interface. Its addition to the Expedition helps this big SUV seem a little less dinosaur-like.
Standard FeaturesThe Expedition comes standard with room for eight, and the ability to tow up to 9,200 pounds in both the 2-wheel-drive (2WD) and 4-wheel-drive (4WD) versions – EL models can tow slightly less: 9,000 for 2WD and 9,100 for 4WD. Ford is the only domestic manufacturer to combine an overhead-cam powerplant with all-independent suspension for levels of performance and composure you can take to the bank – or the beach. And given its family mission, safety is front and center, using AdvanceTrac traction control working with Roll Stability Control to enhance your confidence while driving in unpredictable weather or circumstances.
Factory OptionsNew for the 2015 Ford Expedition is a host of advanced safety systems definitely worth getting on such a large vehicle. Blind-spot monitoring and cross-traffic alerts warn when a vehicle is hiding alongside or approaching as you backup. There’s an upgraded Sony entertainment system, and a rear-seat entertainment system for road trips. One of the cooler options is Truck Apps. In addition to a host of off-road tools, Truck Apps allows you to program in settings for different trailers – such as brake control settings – and name each one for easy retrieval for the next time you hook up.
Engine & TransmissionThis is the biggest news for the 2015 Ford Expedition. After suffering for years with an outdated and inefficient 5.4-liter V8, the new 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 is officially a Big Deal. With more power and torque than the V8 it replaces, this engine has already proven itself a workhorse in Ford’s ubiquitous F-150 pickup, where it has become the engine of choice. The good news is that there’s no loss of capability, with the new Expedition capable of towing just as much as its predecessor. The EcoBoost V6 in the Expedition comes connected to the same 6-speed automatic transmission, and 4-wheel drive with a low-speed transfer case is also available.

The full-size body-on-frame SUV isn’t as popular as it once was, but these big beasts still have their place, and the 2015 Ford Expedition gets numerous updates to stay in the game. Gone is the ancient, fuel-sucking 5.4-liter V8, replaced with Ford’s more powerful and more fuel efficient 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6. Exterior design updates give the nose and tail a more modern look, while retaining the boxy-but-useful 7/8-passenger proportions the Expedition is famous for. Interior updates include MyFord Touch, Ford’s integrated infotainment system. While not an all-new SUV, Ford effectively uses existing technology to counterpunch the new GM SUV twins, the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, plus bit players like the Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada, without sacrificing the Expedition’s capability.

The Sentra’s CVT transmission is one of the best in the industry, and with so many other competitors moving to this more efficient form of selecting gears, the once awkward feeling of driving a CVT now seems commonplace. The Sentra’s electric power steering is nicely weighted and, although not as interactive as the system in the Mazda3, we think it’s better than the setup in the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. The 130 horsepower offered up by the Sentra’s 1.8-liter engine isn’t going to win any races, but it’s enough to keep up with the Toyota Corolla and Ford Focus in both acceleration and fuel economy.
Interior ComfortHigh-quality materials, electroluminescent gauges and a tasteful, contoured design help create what is arguably the finest interior in all of Compactsedanland. The rear-seating area is another inside highlight of the 2015 Nissan Sentra, offering back-seat drivers more legroom than some of the smaller midsize sedans, along with similarly generous headroom. The theme continues all the way back into one of the category’s biggest trunks. The Nissan Sentra sedan is roomy enough, in fact, that it’s one of a handful of compact sedans classified as midsize by the EPA.
Exterior StylingSoftly sculpted sheetmetal, substantial proportions and shiny-object LED headlight accents and taillights all combine to give Nissan’s 2015 Sentra sedan class-above parking-lot presence. All models feature a chrome-finish grille, chrome-finish door handles and body-color painted side mirrors, while up-level versions feature alloy wheels, fog lights and side-mirror-integrated turn signals. The sportier-looking but similarly tuned Sentra SR includes a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust-tip finisher, unique 17-inch alloy wheels and other sporty add-ons all around.

The FE+ (S and SV trims) bumps fuel economy up to 40-mpg highway.
Engine & TransmissionThe Sentra’s 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine is among the least powerful in the segment, but we can attest that it moves two adults up to highway speeds just fine. With four adults, though, highway merging might require a bit more planning. In addition to the CVT there’s a 6-speed manual transmission available, but only on the base model and it delivers about 50 fewer miles per tankful. The FE+ grades achieve one more highway mile per gallon with some aerodynamic adds and low-rolling-resistance tires, but it’s mostly a marketing ploy (40 mpg is much sexier than 39) and not worth the extra $400. Even if you drove exclusively on the highway, the FE+ package would save you just $25 and 10 gallons per year (at $2.50/gallon, 15,000 miles/year).

Read Full Review","What's New?Nissan’s Sentra sedan for 2015 sees a number of big improvements including new standard features such as Bluetooth, a USB port and cruise control. The SV trim gains Intelligent Key, rearview camera and a new Style Package option. The SR gains heated front seats plus features from last year’s Driver’s Package.
Nissan has always endeavored to make its compact Sentra sedan look and feel bigger and more upscale than its reasonable price tag suggests. The 2015 Nissan Sentra advances this philosophy by adding more style and performance than its predecessors. With more interior room than a Dodge Dart and more rear-seat legroom than the Ford Focus, the Sentra offers superior comfort for all its occupants while keeping its exterior dimensions tidy and manageable. The Sentra’s handsome interior is augmented by its advanced infotainment system that includes NissanConnect, an apps-based platform that permits access to Google and Pandora as well as the ability to manage incoming and outgoing text messages.

Driving the Used 2015 BMW X1BMW’s X models have always been more about performance on pavement than pounding dirt, and the X1 is no different. In fact, because of its diminutive size and lighter weight, the 2015 X1 feels even more agile than its larger X siblings. That the X1 can return as much fun as it does while also obtaining highway fuel economy in the low-30-mpg range is automotive icing on the cake. Despite its nimble handling, the X1 is commendably comfortable on the open road. Whether scooting around the city or hauling down the highway, power delivery is excellent with either the feisty 4-cylinder that’s mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission or the stout 6-cylinder engine that uses a 6-speed. All-wheel-drive models are competent in the snow, but venturing far off the beaten path isn’t the X1’s strength.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 BMW X1’s cabin is a mix of sophistication and minimalism. Buttons and knobs are kept to a minimum and the driving position is great, keeping with BMW’s driver-first design philosophy. The standard seating material in this 2-row, 5-passenger compact SUV is SensaTec, a faux leather. The X1’s jet-fighter gear selector looks cool but can be confusing at first. Rear-seat legroom isn’t plentiful, but passengers do have the ability to recline for added comfort. The X1 offers 47.7 cubic feet of cargo space with the 40/20/40-split rear seats folded. With seats up, there’s 12.7 cubic feet of space, comparable to a trunk.
Exterior StylingKeeping with the family resemblance of other X models, the X1 looks like a slightly smaller version of its X3. Rather than blocky SUV panels and high ground clearance, this baby Bimmer sits low and sports a long hood, sweeping lines and an arching roof. Silver-lined trays under the front and rear bumpers give a touch of ruggedness, while roof-mounted cargo rails do the same while offering the practical benefit of securing bikes, boards and other gear.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED ENGINEThis small engine finds duty in BMWs as large at the 5-Series, and it’s easy to see why: It packs surprising power and efficiency. With the help of turbocharging and direct-injection technology, it boasts 240 horsepower and fuel economy of up to 34 mpg.
ULTIMATE PACKAGESuitable for The Ultimate Driving Machine, this feature-laden pack bundles biggies like a navigation system and panoramic moonroof with smaller but thoughtful touches such as ambient lighting hidden in the outer door handles and a voice-command feature that lets you record up to five minutes of spoken notes.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 BMW X1 is available in three trims: sDrive28i, xDrive28i, and the top-line xDrive35i. A base sDrive28i is nicely equipped with dynamic cruise control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and automatic climate control, though you’ll have to adjust the front seats manually. Standard audio in all X1s is provided by an 8-speaker, 180-watt AM/FM/CD system with HD radio and USB/auxiliary inputs. The xDrive28i adds all-wheel drive instead of rear-drive. The xDrive35i amplifies the X1 experience with a 6-cylinder engine, power front seats, xenon headlights, a panoramic moonroof, and 18-inch wheels. All 2015 X1 models include four years/50,000 miles of no-cost maintenance.
Factory OptionsUpgrades abound for the X1, with most options bundled into packages. Among the most popular are a rearview camera, leather interior, a 3D navigation system with an 8.8-inch screen and 80-gig hard drive, and an 11-speaker/340-watt harman/kardon sound system. The BMW Online and BMW Apps subscription service offers real-time news and weather updates along with Google Local Search and connectivity to social networks. A trio of ""lines"" – M Sport, Sport and xLine – add sport suspensions, special wheels and trim bits. Not offered are preventive safety features such as blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking systems.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available in the 2015 BMW X1. The sDrive28i and xDrive28i models feature a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that is powerful and efficient. Both of those models (""sDrive"" equals rear-wheel drive, ""xDrive"" means all-wheel drive) are mated to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission and feature an auto start/stop function that cuts engine operation at idle. This function saves fuel, but its startup can be jarring. Thankfully, disabling start/stop is easy an easy adjustment from the cockpit. Those seeking the most power should look to the xDrive35i, which features a turbocharged 6-cylinder that puts out 300 horsepower, 60 more than the 4-cylinder. That larger engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. All X1 models use premium fuel. BMW does not specify a tow rating for X1.

If you take the road less traveled, this is your ride.","ConsOf course, not everyone who drives an SUV actually goes off road. In that case, the Jeep Grand Cherokee’s on-pavement ride and noticeable interior noise may be turnoffs. Instead, check out the Volkswagen Touareg, or if you need a 7- or 8-passenger carryall, the Nissan Pathfinder or Honda Pilot.",30500,"Driving the Used 2015 Jeep Grand CherokeeOff-road chops aside, the 2015 Grand Cherokee is far more likely to spend its time on pavement, rather than off. Luckily, it’s pretty good here. The resilient and composed highway ride belies the rugged demeanor. This SUV’s electrically assisted steering also feels good, lightly weighted in parking lots and appropriately heavier at speed. However, there’s no escaping the wind noise rushing around the outside mirrors and boxy shape at highway speeds. Still, it’s a reasonable compromise, especially considering how capable the Grand Cherokee is when the pavement ends. With ample ground clearance, good power and multiple off-road modes, the Grand Cherokee excels. The EcoDiesel is smooth and refined, but its $4,500 premium and pricey urea refills every 10,000 miles drive us to recommend the standard V6 or 5.7-liter Hemi V8 instead. If you crave speed and family hauling, the 475-horsepower Grand Cherokee SRT is just the ticket. Speeding ticket, that is.
Interior Comfort“Jeep Grand Cherokee” may be a venerable nameplate, but the SUV’s interior is as contemporary as you’ll find anywhere. This well-finished space accommodates up to five adult passengers, and soft-touch surfaces are plentiful, accented by tasteful wood trims. The optional Uconnect system is complemented by redundant physical controls for technophobes. Behind the rear seats are 35.1 cubic feet of cargo space, which expand to 68.7 with the rear seats folded, figures right in line with the Ford Edge and VW Touareg, but considerably less than Toyota’s 4Runner. Summit and SRT models are quieter, too, thanks to standard active noise cancellation.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s modern exterior is further enhanced this year with the Summit model’s California Edition package. It adds body-color lower body trim, mirror caps and door handles, plus platinum chrome on the grille and lower parts of the vehicle. All Grand Cherokees have Jeep’s signature 7-slot grille, and higher-end models feature extra helpings of chrome. Despite its tall SUV profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, so if you’re short, opt for the power-operated liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesUCONNECT ACCESSJeep’s Uconnect combines cutting-edge connected-car technology with a simple interface. Offering as much as any competitor’s system you’d care to mention, you use the huge 8.4-inch touch panel or voice recognition to access the navigation, or mobile apps like Bing Local Search and Pandora. It also includes hands-free text messaging.
QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSIONThe 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s optional Quadra-Lift air suspension lets Jeep owners pick from five different vehicle height settings. At its highest, the 10.6 inches of ground clearance beat even the Wrangler Rubicon. The system can also be lowered, improving aerodynamics as well as facilitating entry and exit.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee comes in four trims, not counting the SRT: Laredo, Limited, Overland and Summit. Entry-level 2-wheel-drive (2WD) Laredo models are well equipped, featuring dual-zone climate control, a digital instrument cluster, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 6-speaker audio system with a 5-inch touch screen. The Limited adds larger 18-inch wheels and heated leather seats, Overland models get a panoramic moonroof, Uconnect Access infotainment and xenon headlights as standard. The Grand Cherokee Summit is essentially loaded. All Grand Cherokee models get six airbags, a raft of stability-control systems, and Uconnect emergency assistance with a complimentary trial subscription.
Factory OptionsThe Jeep Grand Cherokee’s 4-wheel-drive (4WD) system is optional, and a must if you intend to go Jeeping in your Jeep. Speaking of which, the Quadra-Lift air suspension plus the top-spec Quadra-Drive II 4WD system are essential for any hard-core off-road enthusiast. On your way to the trails, your family will like the Blu-ray entertainment center, which is compatible with most gaming consoles. The standard halogen headlights are so-so at best, so the optional xenon setup is a better bet. In a true sign of the times, a CD player has been relegated to the options list.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee comes with a wide variety of engine choices. There’s the standard 3.6-liter V6, which offers good power and fuel economy. The 5.7-liter V8 amps up the power noticeably, but fuel economy suffers. On the flip side, there’s the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6, which offers the most torque of any engine save the SRT’s V8 and gets great fuel economy, but is a pricey proposition at $4,500. The Grand Cherokee SRT is a completely different animal. With a 475-horsepower 6.4-liter V8, its standard all-wheel-drive system is meant for the street, not the trail. All Grand Cherokees come with an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission.

The SRT and the luxurious Summit model also get Active Noise Cancellation, giving the cabin a much-needed dose of sophistication. There’s also a new California Edition package available for Summit models.
Last year, the Jeep Grand Cherokee got a facelift, new technology and some serious interior updates. This year is all about dotting the last few i’s and crossing a couple final t’s on Jeep’s premiere SUV. It’s all part of Jeep’s ongoing effort to keep up not just with traditional rivals like the Toyota 4Runner and Volkswagen Touareg, but also more premium offerings like the Mercedes-Benz M-Class. One of the most surprising things about the Jeep Grand Cherokee is that it has improved its on-road manners without compromising its off-road ability. Buyers, on the other hand, have a wide range to choose from, be it a frugal 3.0-liter diesel, a powerful and practical V6, or a pavement-shredding Grand Cherokee SRT with 475 horsepower.

Driving the Used 2015 Nissan AltimaThe 2015 Nissan Altima’s key selling point may be its driving dynamics. Without giving up any of its mainstream family-car duties, this midsize sedan nonetheless manages to impart a measure of driving fun that’s uncommon in the segment. Its multilink independent suspension and best-in-class continuously variable automatic transmission will convince you that Nissan engineers are truthful when they say they benchmarked premium sedans like the Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series. While a bit stiff on the harshest surfaces, the Nissan Altima won’t beat you up around town while remaining nimble enough on mountain roads to be, dare we say, fun. The powerful 3.5-liter V6 is the obvious enthusiast choice, but the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is more than adequate for light loads and level roads. The unique multifunction rearview camera performed its lookout jobs well, and the NASA-inspired seats proved as fatigue-reducing as claimed.
Interior ComfortNo matter how much you like the 2015 Nissan Altima’s interior layout, or its plentiful high-end and soft-touch materials, or the easy-to-use center stack, it’s the NASA-inspired ""zero gravity"" front bucket seats that you’ll love the most. They’re designed to approach the relaxed ""neutral posture"" the human body assumes in a weightless environment. While we didn’t book time on Virgin Galactic to test the claim, we can say that they’re surprisingly comfortable for the long haul, especially for midsize-sedan class cars. The rear seat offers very good legroom, and the huge trunk can swallow just about anything.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Nissan Altima strikes a difficult balance, managing to look stylish, but without running the risk of getting prematurely dated. The classic proportions help: The Altima is wide, giving it an aggressive stance, and the body’s long lines give it character without going overboard, like the Hyundai Sonata. The result is a midsize sedan that maybe isn’t quite as pretty as a Ford Fusion, Mazda6, or even a Chevy Malibu, but one that definitely looks more distinctive than a Toyota Camry or Volkswagen Passat.
Favorite FeaturesEASY FILL TIRE ALERT Falling squarely into the why-didn’t-anybody-think-of-this-before category is the Nissan Altima’s Easy Fill Tire Alert. Using the tire pressure monitoring system – standard on all cars since 2007 – the Altima’s horn honks and the lights flash to let you know you’ve added enough air to the tires.
NISSANCONNECTThere’s no question we love our handheld gadgets, and manufacturers are scrambling to bring mobile connectivity to the driver’s seat. NissanConnect lets Altima SV and SL owners use things like Facebook. To avoid distractions, the keyboard sensibly locks out when you’re driving.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2015 Nissan Altima 2.5 comes standard with a 6-way manual driver’s seat and a 4-way front passenger seat, plus a 60/40-split/folding rear bench seat, power windows and doorlocks, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with touch controls, remote keyless entry with a pushbutton ignition, NissanConnect Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, and a 4.0-inch color customizable Advanced Driver Assist display. New to the standard list for 2015 SV models is the NissanConnect app suite, along with a new 8-way power driver’s seat. Top-line 2.5 SL and 3.5 SL sedans get loaded with leather, premium trim, automatic climate control, and other luxuries.
Factory OptionsNissan bundles most of its major features with specific models, leaving few standalone options. Among them is a Convenience Package for SV models, which adds a moonroof, rear air conditioning vents, and a one-touch passenger side window, among other things. A Technology package for the SV and SL models adds navigation to the touch screen. Altima S models can be augmented with a Display Audio Package that adds a 5-inch color display, and a Sport Value package that adds a remote engine start, 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and a trunk-mounted spoiler.
Engine & TransmissionWhile many manufacturers are offering different 4-cylinder engines, hybrids, and diesels, the 2015 Nissan Altima sedan goes the traditional route by offering a base 4-cylinder and a V6 as the ""up"" engine. The 2.5-liter four is designed for lighter weight and higher efficiency, while the 3.5-liter V6 offers improved fuel economy, adding one mpg to the combined and highway scores. Both drive the Altima’s front wheels through the only gearbox offered, Nissan’s next-generation Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Not everyone loves a CVT, which drives engine revs ahead of vehicle speed during strong acceleration, but this one accounts for both the 4-cylinder and the V6’s impressive fuel economy, and it comes with fixed-ratio-simulating manual shift paddles on up-level Altima models.

Midsize family sedans are the heart of the new-car market, accounting for a huge number of sales each year. Every manufacturer wants a slice of that pie, and it’s not uncommon for the Nissan Altima to have one of the biggest slices, after the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, of course. The 2015 Nissan Altima offers a handful of subtle upgrades to keep it in the hunt, such as slightly better fuel economy for the 3.5-liter V6, and expanded availability of NissanConnect, the manufacturer’s app suite. All of this comes in a car that offers up lots of interior space, a classy design, and premium materials throughout the handsome cabin.

Top-line versions of the Soul begin at around $21,500 and can hit $27,000 fully loaded. The all-electric Kia Soul EV starts at $34,525 before incentives (such as the $7,500 federal tax credit). Even with an automatic transmission, the Soul’s entry cost undercuts the base price of the Fiat 500L, Nissan Juke and Scion xB. Pricing for the Soul EV is still to be announced.

Resale value is expected to be very good for the Soul, though still trailing that of the xB in the long run.
Driving the Used 2015 Kia SoulWith its 29-percent-stiffer chassis and reworked suspension, this latest-generation Kia Soul is far more graceful than the first-gen model that exited in 2013. The cabin is quieter and the suspension does a better job of absorbing all but the largest of road imperfections. While it’s true that Kia’s funky 5-door hatchback offers the Flex Steer feature to let you tailor steering resistance among three levels, all remain poor conduits of information from the front tires to the driver. Even so, the Soul steers predictably and corners with more confidence than prior versions. Acceleration is merely adequate when overtaking traffic or merging on the freeway, even with the more powerful 2.0-liter engine. Like its gasoline counterpart, acceleration isn’t a strong suit of the new Soul EV, but the all-electric Kia did prove quiet and showed respectable handling and responsiveness in our initial test drive.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Kia Soul features a 2-row, 5-passenger cabin whose looks and functions improve as you climb the three trim levels, from cloth seats in base models to available Nappa leather in top-line versions. The 2015 Soul does an admirable job of blending practicality and whimsy. This hatchback’s boxy shape and folding rear seats make it surprisingly spacious, while features such as speaker lights that pulsate to the beat are nothing if not different. The optional panoramic sunroof is an unexpected treat in such an economy car. The electric Soul features bio-friendly materials and an efficient organic LED instrument screen.
Exterior StylingThe latest Soul retains the original’s tall, rectangular profile, but stays fresh thanks to a reworked front end and tall taillights. The Soul’s tall profile offers function in addition to fashion. Along with abundant headroom and luggage space, the high roof allows for raised seating positions and good visibility for all inside. Top-line models further stand out with LED turn-signal indicators in the side mirrors, projector-beam headlights and LED taillights. The Soul electric car sets itself apart with a hidden charging port up front and a 2-tone paint scheme initially consisting of white with a blue roof or silver with white roof.
Favorite FeaturesUVO eSERVICESUVO is the name for Kia’s infotainment suite, which includes everything from audio entertainment and Bluetooth phone pairing to navigation and vehicle diagnostics. For 2015, UVO adds Geo-fencing, Speed Alert, Curfew Alert and Driving Score, all of which can be especially helpful for keeping track of younger drivers and their habits.
VENTILATED FRONT SEATSA sweat-free posterior is a wonderful thing. How cool is it, then, that the glorious comfort of ventilated front seats is available in the Kia Soul – a car with a sub-$16,000 base price? Sure, the ventilated seats cost extra, but man are they worth it.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Kia Soul comes in three trims: Base, Plus (+), and Exclaim (!). The Base trim includes basics like air conditioning, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a 6-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, power windows and doorlocks, Bluetooth wireless technology, and 6-speaker audio with USB input. Plus models add a larger engine and automatic transmission, plus cruise control, keyless entry and upgraded cloth trim. Top-line Exclaim Souls include 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power-folding outside mirrors, Kia’s UVO eServices, a rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. EV models include an 8.0-inch touch screen with navigation and a suite of EV-centric controls.
Factory OptionsUpgrades vary by trim level but include an 8.0-inch touch-screen display and navigation, rearview camera, leather seating, heated front and rear seats, ventilated front seats, LED interior lighting, push-button start, and automatic climate control. Premium tunes can be heard via an Infinity audio system with a prominent center speaker. Drivers looking to eke out fuel economy have the option of the Idle Stop & Go system, which cuts engine power when the vehicle is stopped, such as at traffic signals.
Engine & TransmissionTwo 4-cylinder engines are available in the 2015 Soul. Base models come with a 1.6-liter, while the two higher trims use a larger and more-powerful (and more-recommendable) 2.0-liter. All Kia Souls are front-wheel drive, and all except the base model come with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Base models use a 6-speed manual (the automatic is optional). The Soul EV uses no gasoline at all, but rather an electric motor powered by a lithium-ion polymer battery pack. Power is sent to the front wheels via a single-speed transmission. Range is estimated to be 93 miles per charge, which is expected to take from 24 hours on a 120-volt outlet to under five hours on a 240-volt outlet. A DC fast-charging unit can offer an 80-percent charge in about 30 minutes.

Other than that, the Soul receives only minor updates such as UVO telematics packaging for base models and available Nappa leather seating in top trims.
There’s nothing on the road quite like the 2015 Kia Soul. With its funky exterior design and interior roominess that both come thanks to this vehicle’s boxy design – not to mention its sub-"

Bigger-than-life styling is augmented by a plush interior and a host of cutting-edge safety and communication features.","ConsIf you don’t need the big look, big cost and big fuel bills associated with a full-size pickup, so-called compacts like the GMC Canyon can still tow, haul and accommodate big-truck needs, but in a more manageable package. Those seeking better fuel economy should look at the Ram 1500 diesel.",27800,"Driving the Used 2015 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabGMC’s full-size 2015 Sierra pickup is a truck designed to both work and play hard whether in 2-wheel or 4-wheel-drive (2WD, 4WD) forms. We spent considerable time behind the wheel of a 5.3-liter V8 model and felt the powertrain was more than capable in nearly every situation. During long drives at highway speeds, the Sierra’s cabin proved impressively quiet. Small road imperfections proved no match for the Sierra’s suspension, although we did discover the limitation of its body-on-frame design while traversing one particular rough patch on the freeway. When it came to towing, however, our Sierra had no problem whatsoever lugging a 5,000-pound Airstream trailer up steep grades. Thanks to an upgrade this year, we give the Sierra’s telematics system an A+, but still feel the rearview camera could do with a higher resolution, especially helpful when hitching up a trailer.
Interior ComfortWith big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, GMC’s 2015 Sierra’s roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be luxurious, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers’ devices. Cab configurations include regular with a 3-passenger bench, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.
Exterior StylingWe dub GMC’s latest styling experiment ""contemporary macho."" Like previous GMC trucks, this full-size pickup features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck proud. With the new styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5 feet, 8 inches to 8 feet. Double-cab models now have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED INFOTAINMENTFor 2015, the GMC Sierra pickup offers the IntelliLink touch-screen system, which operates navigation, audio and, new this year, Siri Eyes-Free for iPhone and OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot. Equally impressive are the five USB inputs and 110-volt outlet for charging any and all devices you bring along.
DRIVER-ALERT SEATWorking in conjunction with the 2015 Sierra’s lane-departure and forward-collision warning systems, this important safety feature vibrates the driver’s seat to warn of potential danger. The system can even vibrate either side of the seat independently, jostling your left leg when drifting to the left and vice versa.
Standard FeaturesEven the most basic 2015 GMC Sierra includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats and an AM/FM radio with a 4.2-inch color display and USB/SD inputs, but no CD player, Bluetooth or telescoping steering wheel. Step up to an SLE trim and you’ll get a rearview camera, 6-speaker audio and 17-inch wheels made of premium aluminum instead of steel. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen command center, power-adjustable pedals and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali’s 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio and leather-clad front bucket seats.
Factory OptionsAdd-ons are available across the entire 2015 Sierra lineup to make it more functional and comfortable. All Sierras can be equipped with 4WD, while those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Other options of note include the Driver Alert Package with lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package includes an off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available for the 2015 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8 and the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. The first two are linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2-liter gets a new 8-speed automatic. All three engines have laudable towing capacity, including the V6’s max of 7,200 pounds. On the other end is the 6.2-liter V8 that can pull up to 12,000 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,500 pounds and a highway rating of 23 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC’s engine lineup. All the engines use technology such as direct injection and Active Fuel Management, which allows them to run on fewer cylinders and thus use less fuel.

The Denali gains GM’s Magnetic Ride Control suspension, while Siri Eyes-Free and OnStar 4G LTE with built-in Wi-Fi hot spot is made available. A spray-in bedliner is also available on all models.
Thanks to a complete overhaul last year, the GMC Sierra pickup line for 2015 arrives just in time to do battle with latest Ford F-150, Ram 1500, Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan. Although it shares much of its chassis and mechanicals with the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC stamps its own upscale brand on the Sierra, giving it the feel of a work truck for the boss rather than the crew. It is true that the basic Sierra work truck isn’t all that plush, but move up the line to the Denali model and you’ll find more leather and chrome than in a Texas rodeo gift shop. A choice of V6 or V8 engines is offered, as is a new 8-speed automatic transmission.

Packed with features and with an affordable price, the Santa Fe Sport should be on any crossover-SUV shopper’s list.","ConsThe Santa Fe Sport is bigger than many compact SUVs, but it’s still on the small side for those who need extra cargo space or who need three rows. Its towing capabilities aren’t particularly distinguished, either.",26000,"Driving the Used 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe SportCrossover SUVs like the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport are generally not thought of as being particularly entertaining to drive. However, this Hyundai SUV is an exception. There’s more to it than just the available 264-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, too. The stiff structure means the suspension can be set up for both good cornering grip and a comfortable ride. If you opt for the all-wheel-drive models, the Active Cornering Control AWD system utilizes torque vectoring and torque braking to improve stability while cornering, maintaining traction at the most desired wheels. The lively chassis means that even if you order the standard 190-horsepower 2.4-liter engine, you’ll still be entertained behind the wheel. Add in some major efforts at reducing interior noise levels, and Hyundai’s Santa Fe Sport is one of the most refined, nicest-driving compact SUVs on the market.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport proves that you don’t have to sacrifice user friendliness to have a contemporary interior design. All the controls inside are easy to reach and understand, and everything is constructed with care and high-quality materials. It’s also practical, with stain-resistant Yes Essentials fabric or available leather, and a rear bench seat that folds in a 40/20/40 split and is also available with 5.2 inches of fore-and-aft travel and a recline function as part of an option package. Behind the seats is a good-sized cargo space, making the Santa Fe Sport exceptionally flexible.
Exterior StylingHyundai gave the 2015 Santa Fe Sport a subtle 2-tone treatment to the grille, emphasizing the ""Sport"" part of the name, and the crossover SUV also gets daytime running lights standard. Otherwise, the same exterior as last year carries over, and that’s fine with us. We like the sharply styled design, with impressive details merging with aerodynamic efficiency that include hidden underbody fairings. Standard equipment on the Sport are 17-inch alloy wheels with 235-65R17 tires, while the Sport 2.0T has 18-inch alloys with 235/60R18 tires as standard and 19-inch alloys with 235/55R19 tires optionally available.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED ENGINEIt wasn’t too long ago that a 264-horsepower 4-cylinder would be paired with a rear-wheel-drive sports car. Here, it’s just fine hauling the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport around with ease. Matched with a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic, the combination delivers plenty of power for any driving eventuality.
HANDS-FREE SMART LIFTGATE WITH AUTO OPENA mouthful of a name, but a simple device: Stand near the power rear hatch with the key in your pocket, and after a few seconds the hatch will open. No button to push, no foot to wave under the bumper, just standing there is all it takes.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport adds daytime running lights, a driver’s-side blind-spot mirror and auto up/down passenger window to the standard-equipment list. Also standard are air conditioning, cruise control, tilt/telescoping steering column, steering-wheel-mounted controls, remote keyless entry, an audio system that includes HD radio, USB and auxiliary inputs, Bluetooth and Blue Link. Turbocharged 2.0T models get a lot more equipment standard, including most of the base model’s Popular Equipment Package, adding roof rails, fog lights, heated mirrors, power driver’s seat, heated front seats, push-button start/stop and more. Safety features include stability and traction control, and plenty of airbags.
Factory OptionsThe base 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers the Popular Equipment Package mentioned above, plus a Premium Package that adds leather, blind-spot detection, dual-zone automatic temperature control and other features. The Tech Package includes the panoramic sunroof, rear park assist, navigation with 8-inch touch screen, Dimension premium audio, memory for driver’s seat and mirrors, heated seats, and this year, the new power tailgate. The only package for Santa Fe Sport 2.0T models is an Ultimate Package, which adds 19-inch wheels and tires, HID xenon headlights, LED taillights, the power tailgate, Infinity sound system, and more.
Engine & TransmissionYou have two engine options for the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. Standard is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 190 horsepower; if that’s not enough, the 264-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the Sport 2.0T should satisfy you. Both engines benefit from modern technology direct fuel injection and continuously variable valve timing for the optimum in efficiency and power. The only transmission choice is a 6-speed automatic with a Shiftronic manual shift gate, for those who wish to shift for themselves, and is available in either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD), delivering responsive and impressive performance and fuel economy.

The 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport embodies what’s become a classic Hyundai formula: offer a premium-feeling vehicle, with distinctive styling and upscale features, for the price that fits a more modest budget. With seating for five, two different 4-cylinder engines, front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), plus a lot of clever features, the Santa Fe Sport compact SUV offers a lot to shoppers. The suspension and steering setups get revised for a better sense of control, and a new power liftgate opens automatically if you just stand near it with the key in your pocket. It’s a lot of crossover SUV, worth a look from anybody checking out vehicles ranging from the Toyota RAV4 and Chevrolet Equinox to the Ford Edge and Kia Sorento.

Those seeking a more comfortable ride should look to the Lexus GS 350, while fuel-economy-minded buyers should look to the BMW 535d or Audi A6 TDI.",71000,"Driving the Used 2015 Maserati GhibliMaserati’s 2015 Ghibli S Q4 places an emphasis on performance driving, with a firm suspension, a neck-snapping 404-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6, and a body built for speed. Rear-drive models get a less powerful but equally potent 345-horsepower V6. A stiff chassis helps with the car’s handling, although the steering feels overly light on center and then almost argumentative when the time comes to execute turns. The Ghibli can run to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, with the AWD system biased completely to the rear wheels until it’s needed. Press the Sport button on the center dash, and gearshifts and throttle response get crisper, while it also opens up the sport exhaust, which makes a great sound. Although the Ghibli’s throttle loves to be wide open, the 8-speed automatic feels less certain what to do at speeds between zero and 100 mph.
Interior ComfortInside the 2015 Ghibli sports sedan the atmosphere is spacious and very Italian. The standard leather interior is nicely detailed and assembled and rear passengers have room to relax. On the list of options is a luxurious Poltrona Frau leather interior. Personalization options include a range of six leather colors and five looks for the trim details – among them Radica, Ebano, and Carbonio, the first two of wood and the third of carbon fiber. We could do with a few less obvious Chrysler parts, however, such as the minivan power window switches and headlight switch from the 300 sedan.
Exterior StylingPersonalized aesthetics are a big deal for Italian cars and their clients, and the Maserati Ghibli sedan can be ordered in eleven different colors from the catalogue – most at added cost. The stunning array of wheels available from Maserati (there are seven) ranges from a standard 18-inch to an aggressive 21-inch forged design. Even the brake calipers from Brembo can be ordered in four different colors – black, red, blue, or silver. Exterior lines established by the new Maserati Quattroporte are faithfully echoed here in smaller scale on the Ghibli and look better at this size.
Favorite FeaturesALUMINUM STRUCTUREThe Ghibli’s aluminum-rich chassis helps keep it light and strong. The ample use of high-strength aluminum increases rigidity and improves handling, and helps Maserati’s newest sports sedan earn a 5-star Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
INTERIOR SPACEMost midsize sedans offer ample front seat legroom but come up short when it comes to back-seat passengers. Maserati’s Ghibli for 2015 provides ample room for rear-seat adults, more than in an Audi A6, Lexus GS or Cadillac CTS. There’s also an ample 18.7 cubic feet of trunk space.
Standard FeaturesAs a benefit of the Italians often feeling that loading the car with content helps them better compete, even the base Ghibli for North America does well on standard equipment. All trims come standard with a mechanical limited-slip rear differential and a solid set of Brembo compound brake discs. Inside, passengers will always be surrounded by some form of all-leather interior, while the S Q4 comes with a large sunroof. All turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 gasoline engines for the Ghibli are based off of the Chrysler Pentastar V6 blueprint and modified extensively. Navigation and heated front seats are standard.
Factory OptionsSignificant options for the Maserati Ghibli range start with the aesthetic personalization list, which includes multiple exterior colors, interior leathers (2-tone treatments also available), trim details, wheel selections, and even brake caliper colors. The $1,770 sunroof is an option on the base Ghibli. Performance wise, the biggest choice to make is the optional Skyhook adaptive suspension. For the S Q4 sedan there is the stereophonic choice of a Bowers & Wilkins hi-fi system.
Engine & TransmissionUsing the Chrysler Pentastar 3.0-liter engine block and head as a starting point, the Maserati Ghibli sedan benefits from the two separate power ratings of a twin-turbocharged powerplant built by Ferrari. Whether at 345-hp or 404-hp trim, the responsiveness via the very sweet-shifting 8-speed automatic gearbox is satisfying, and the voice of the sport exhaust likewise. The powerplants are sadly not yet direct-injected and so their fuel efficiency – using regular unleaded – is not stellar as it should be.
With the responsibility of the Ghibli sedan to produce maximum sales, Maserati will later come out with hybrid-EV trims, a GT S trim and/or an ultra-aggressive MC Stradale version. A first-ever 3.0-liter turbocharged Ghibli diesel is offered in Europe.

With its Quattroporte-inspired styling, the 2015 Maserati Ghibli sports sedan holds a distinct advantage over less visually dynamic cars. The Ghibli sports sedan and its all-wheel-drive twin, the Ghibli S Q4, are powered by a set of twin-turbocharged V6 engines that pump out 345 and 404 horsepower, respectively. The Ghibli’s overall performance, however, isn’t nearly as polished or refined as that of the BMW 5 Series, which might be forgivable if not for the Ghibli’s rather lofty sticker price. A handsome interior is somewhat degraded by parts clearly pilfered from Chrysler products and the hard front seats leave something to be desired. Then again, for those more impressed by making a statement than flat-out performance, Maserati’s 2015 Ghibli speaks loud and clear.

The Elantra’s interior also has a few cheap feeling bits, and there’s no premium audio option.",18000,"Driving the Used 2015 Hyundai ElantraThe 2015 Hyundai Elantra splits the difference between the sporty-driving Mazda3 and Ford Focus, and the more mainstream and comfortable Chevrolet Cruze and Nissan Sentra. A 6-speed manual transmission comes standard, or you can opt for a 6-speed automatic. The transmissions do their best to make the most of the 1.8-liter 4-cylinder’s 145 horsepower, but if that’s not enough, the Elantra Sport sedan, the Elantra Coupe and the Elantra GT hatchback are all available with the 173-horsepower 2.0-liter engine. Elantra GT, SE and Limited models come with 3-mode, driver-selectable steering, designed to improve feedback in sporty driving. The GT and Elantra Coupe also get stiffer suspensions for more aggressive driving. Yet even in everyday traffic, all Elantras are comfortable and well insulated from road and wind noise, especially for a compact car.
Interior ComfortAlthough the 2015 Elantra competes as a compact car, the roomy interior gets it classified as a midsize car by the EPA. The comfortable interior features some higher-end soft-touch materials, but there’s also some low-end feeling plastic on the doors and switches. The front seats are properly shaped for leisurely or aggressive driving, and while rear legroom is only adequate for the sedan and Coupe, it’s downright generous in the GT. Fold-down seats augment the large trunk in the sedan and Coupe, and if you haul extra gear but don’t want an SUV, the hatchback-only GT is a good pick.
Exterior StylingHyundai says the 2015 Elantra’s ""Fluidic Sculpture"" design evokes water flowing around rocks. Whatever you call it, the curves and swoops combine elegantly with sweeping headlights and taillights, looking upscale without feeling gaudy or over the top. Aside from having only two doors, Coupe versions are distinguished by a large, trapezoidal mouth and twin tailpipes in the rear. The GT hatchback receives a similar treatment up front and a sloping roof that looks rather fashionable.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER SELECTABLE STEERING MODEThe 2015 Elantra’s Driver Selectable Steering Mode allows the driver to choose from three settings: Comfort, Normal and Sport, and is available on the GT hatchback and the SE and Limited sedans.
HEATED REAR SEATSOne of the more surprising standard features on the Elantra Limited sedan is the heated rear seats. Usually extra-cost even on luxury cars, it’s almost unheard of in this segment, and just one more way Hyundai is turning up the heat on the competition.
Standard FeaturesThe base-level Elantra SE sedan comes standard with a manual transmission, air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, and a telescoping steering wheel. Also standard are upscale features like keyless entry, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, aluminum-alloy wheels, and a 172-watt 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/satellite radio with USB/iPod inputs. Coupe and GT models feature heated front seats, and GT models come standard with a glove compartment that can be chilled. Coupe and sedan models have six airbags, while Elantra GT versions add a seventh for the driver’s knees.
Factory OptionsThe 2015 Hyundai Elantra sedan has two upgrade paths from the base SE model. There’s the Sport, which gives you the more powerful 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, or the Limited, which adds more luxury, but keeps the less powerful engine. A new Style package for SE models adds a moonroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, projector headlights, and chrome and aluminum accents. The revised Tech package for Elantra Sport models adds navigation and an upgraded audio system, plus Hyundai BlueLink. The Limited gets a new Ultimate package, which adds navigation, a sunroof, upgraded audio, dual zone climate control, and push-button start.
Engine & TransmissionThe Elantra SE and Limited sedans both get a 145-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, while Elantra Sport sedans, the Elantra Coupe, and Elantra GT all get a 173-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. We think the better bet is the 2.0-liter engine. It offers significantly better power, at the expense of only a moderate hit to fuel economy. Transmission choices are between a 6-speed manual available for the sedan and GT hatchback. A 6-speed automatic is available for the sedan and GT, and oddly is the only transmission available for the sporty looking coupe. The automatic comes with an Eco mode to further enhance fuel economy, and manual shifting mode for a bit of added sport.

After a slight facelift for 2014, the 2015 Hyundai Elantra compact gets only a few tweaks this year, mostly rearranging option packages. But that’s OK, as its style, fuel economy, interior space, features, and warranty continue to make it a tough act to follow. Both its quality ratings and resale values are as good as the leading compact cars, and the Elantra’s full lineup of sedan, coupe and GT hatchback models is a real threat to compact cars like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Ford Focus. Your practical side will appreciate the 38 mpg on the highway, or you can tickle your inner enthusiast with a sporty 173-horsepower engine.

Key to this is the available Magnetic Ride Control (MRC), standard on LTZ trims, which adjusts the stiffness of the shock absorbers in milliseconds according to changing road conditions. The result is little body lean for a vehicle this size, but with a compliant ride. Unlike its competition, the Tahoe still has a solid rear axle – normally that means a harsher ride – but MRC helps here, too. The suspension, newly responsive steering and 355-horsepower V8 engine combine to make the Tahoe easy to drive on mountain roads. The biggest downside is fuel economy, which hovered in the mid- to high-teens despite tricks like cylinder deactivation.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Tahoe’s driver’s seat features multiple adjustments, so it’s easy get comfortable. The materials feel upscale, and we liked the easy-to-understand control layout. Adults will wish the 2nd-row captain’s chairs adjusted forward and back, not just for seatback angle, but that’s better than the tiny third row – its poor footroom and legroom make it for kids only. There’s not much space behind the third row for cargo, but the new raised floor – there to help make a flat cargo floor when the third row’s folded – features a handy storage area beneath it.
Exterior StylingWith the 2015 Tahoe, Chevrolet continues to put daylight between its pickup trucks and the SUVs based on them. The new Tahoe shares no exterior panels with the truck it’s based on, giving designers unprecedented freedom. The silhouette is familiar, but the sharp-edged styling, sculpted flanks, and cool LED-accented headlights strike a bold look for this big brute. Parked side by side, the Tahoe looks wider than its GMC Yukon cousin – credit the wide grille, which blends into the headlights. We also liked the optional power running boards.
Favorite FeaturesINTERIORThis is the best interior treatment we’ve ever seen in a domestic SUV. We’re not exaggerating when we say the 2015 Tahoe LTZ interior is nicer than the one in the previous-generation Cadillac Escalade Platinum.
FOLD FLAT THIRD ROWBetter late than never, they say. While much of the Tahoe’s competition has embraced fold-flat seats for more than a decade, this is the first time you don’t have to remove this big Chevy’s third row to maximize cargo room. The power fold mechanism even works quickly.
Standard FeaturesEvery Tahoe comes with the 5.3-liter V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. Base LS trims get cloth seats, Bluetooth for phone and audio, automatic climate control, and rear parking sensors. Mid-range Tahoe LT trims get forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, Chevrolet MyLink infotainment, and Bose audio as standard equipment. The top-line LTZ trims add rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot alerts, Magnetic Ride Control, and 20-inch wheels. Note that if you want to seat eight passengers, you can’t go higher than the LT since LTZ trims come only with two captain’s chairs in the middle row.
Factory OptionsIf you miss the old-time feel of a front bench, the 2015 Tahoe LS is your dream vehicle, since you can still order one. The LTZ’s luxury touches – most of them anyhow – can be had on the LT thanks to the $2,705 Luxury Package. The $3,305 Sun, Entertainment and Destinations package bundles navigation, a rear-seat entertainment system with Blu-ray, and a power sunroof on LT and LTZ trims. The security package adds a vehicle tilt sensor – in case someone tries to steal your wheels – and an interior motion sensor, a relative bargain at only $395.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe comes with one engine: a 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8. That sounds familiar to Tahoe fans, but this engine is significantly different from its predecessor. It features direct injection, which helps improve fuel economy while also increasing power and torque, a nice trick. It also features GM’s Active Cylinder Management, which imperceptibly shuts off half of the cylinders under steady cruise to help preserve fuel. The engine comes connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. And of course, you can get 4-wheel drive with a proper off-road-ready low range.

The engines have been upgraded with advanced technology to improve horsepower and fuel economy, and the new interior could be out of luxury sedan.
If there was ever a case for, ""if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,"" it was the Chevrolet Tahoe. GM’s stable of full-size SUVs – which includes the GMC Yukon – already dominate the full-size SUV class to the tune of owning around 70 percent of the market. They outsell Ford 5-1, and Toyota 10-1. Yet Chevrolet went all out with the 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe, giving it an all-new chassis, all-new styling, an upgraded suspension and engine, and an interior that’s more luxurious than the last-generation Cadillac Escalade. Throw in class-leading technology, and it’s clear that there’s little out there to dethrone this king of the road.

Although it’s categorized as a compact sedan, the Cruze’s interior volume actually qualifies it as a midsize model.","ConsThose who enjoy the added convenience offered by a 5-door hatchback will have to look to the Ford Focus, VW Golf or Hyundai Elantra. Driving enthusiasts will find more to like behind the wheel of a Mazda3 or Dodge Dart.",18600,"Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet CruzeWhere some small sedans prioritize handling at any cost, the 2015 Chevrolet Cruze bucks the trend, opting instead for a comfortable ride we think most small-car buyers will find a refreshing change of pace. The Cruze’s steering is nicely weighted and direct, the brakes are firm, and throttle response from the 1.4-liter turbocharged engine is admirable. We did experience some turbo lag when accelerating from a dead stop, however, and although we know most people will opt for the somewhat sluggish 6-speed automatic, performance is much livelier with the available 6-speed manual. More impressive is the turbodiesel model offering ample power for quick acceleration and 46 mpg on the highway. Although not as refined as VW’s TDI clean diesel, the Chevy engine nonetheless delivers in the areas most important to diesel-car fans, namely ample torque and a long cruising range.
Interior ComfortFor a compact car, the 2015 Chevrolet Cruze’s interior is surprisingly roomy. In fact, it qualifies as a midsize sedan, according to the EPA’s rating system. Material quality is impressive. Controls for functions such as audio and climate are easy to see, reach and use. The Cruze is commendable when it comes to seat comfort. Front legroom is excellent, while the rear bench seat is comfortable for two adults, provided the front seats are not fully extended. Higher-trim models have leather seating standard in place of cloth. Abundant sound-deadening material makes the Cruze’s cabin one of the quietest in the segment.
Exterior StylingChevy’s compact Cruze for 2015 gets a modest refresh, bringing its styling more in line with the Impala and Malibu sedans. We predict that the sedan’s angled lines and confident stance will hold up well in the years to come. What are perhaps the sedan’s most striking features are its headlights and lens housings that wrap around the front and angle sharply above the front fenders. LT and LTZ include LED daytime running lights that complement the design. Despite the Cruze’s cavernous cargo hold, the car’s trunk lid and rear are surprisingly tidy. Wheel sizes range from 16 to 18 inches.
Favorite Features1.4-LITER ECOTEC TURBO ENGINEChevy’s Cruze sedan for 2015 offers a 4-cylinder turbocharged engine delivering ample horsepower and torque with impressive fuel economy. We also love that Chevrolet offers a manual transmission on models other than just the base car. We definitely prefer it to the somewhat sluggish 6-speed automatic.
ONSTAR WITH 4G LTE AND WI-FI HOTSPOTOnStar 4G LTE with available Wi-Fi hotspot provides a mobile hub for drivers and passengers with easy access to apps and services that require a high-speed data connection. The hotspot can connect to a smartphone, tablet or laptop and can host up to seven devices at one time.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Chevrolet Cruze 4-door sedan comes in six trim levels that admittedly seem like alphabet soup: LS, 1LT, Eco, 2LT, LTZ and Diesel. Even a base LS is reasonably well-equipped with premium cloth seating, Bluetooth, a 6-speaker AM/FM/XM/CD/USB audio system, keyless entry and a 6-month trial of GM’s OnStar service. The LS does not come with cruise control. It is also the only gasoline model to use the 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine – the others employ the smaller, more efficient 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. All models have an impressive 10 airbags including driver and front-passenger knee airbags.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2015 Chevy Cruze vary by trim and include navigation, a rearview camera, 9-speaker Pioneer premium audio, a power driver’s seat, Wi-Fi hot spot, a power sunroof and a remote vehicle starter. An RS package offers a sportier look with a rear spoiler, lower bodywork, fog lights and unique front and rear fascias. Enhanced safety features include blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rear park assist.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available for the 2015 Cruze. The two gasoline models use a naturally aspirated 1.8-liter 4-cylinder or a smaller, more efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder. Both gasoline engines make 138 horsepower and run on regular unleaded. The third choice is a 2.0-liter turbodiesel that makes an 151 horsepower and impressive 264 lb-ft of torque. The diesel is estimated to earn 46 mpg in highway driving. While that figure matches the manual-transmission Cruze Eco, we’ve found that diesels often get better-than-stated highway fuel efficiency. The diesel uses an emissions fluid that requires refilling every 10,000 miles to coincide with oil changes. The 2015 Cruze Diesel includes a 2-year maintenance plan. Gasoline models offer a choice of 6-speed manual or auto transmission, while diesels exclusively use a 6-speed automatic.

Where foreign automakers once dominated the compact-car segment, we now see the domestic industry making a resilient comeback. Leading the pack is the 2015 Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan, a thoroughly complete small car offering an impressive array of features and trims. In a matchup with such heavyweights as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, the Cruze offers more engine choices, including a fuel-efficient diesel. The Cruze feels more substantial than most economy cars, with a solid feel, an extremely quiet cabin and ride and handling comparable to many midsize sedans. By adding the latest high-tech features, Chevy hopes to lure away younger buyers currently shopping for cars like the Ford Focus and Hyundai Elantra.

The Ram 1500, for instance, is rated up to 28 mpg. And then there’s the 800-pound gorilla, the 2015 Ford F-150, which actually just shed 700 pounds thanks to its aluminum body.",30000,"Driving the Used 2015 Toyota Tundra Access CabOn road and off, Toyota’s full-size truck is still formidable. Its standard 310-horsepower, 4.6-liter V8 is more than acceptable for lighter duties, while the 381-horsepower, 5.7-liter V8 is up for almost any task (yes, it famously pulled the Space Shuttle over a bridge). On the open road, the Tundra’s cabin is surprisingly quiet. Toyota’s half-ton truck isn’t exactly nimble, but it drives smaller than its dimensions suggest. The Tundra’s 6-speed automatic transmission is smooth, though not as buttery as the Ram’s 8-speed. The Tundra does not offer a locking rear differential, but the big truck had no problems when we drove a 4-wheel-drive (4WD) TRD edition up muddy embankments, crawled down steep hills and waded through water. With TRD Pro Off-Road models you can tackle even more, including small jumps without fear of bottoming out. As a bonus, the Tundra TRD Pro’s long suspension travel creates a more comfortable on-road ride.
Interior ComfortAs with most full-size pickups, the Tundra’s interior spans from that of a basic truck with a 3-passenger fabric bench seat to a luxurious family hauler with brown leather interior and wood trim. Double-cab and CrewMax cab variants seat up to six when you opt for a bench in front, or five with the more comfortable bucket seats. Even base SR trims have a 6.1-inch touch-screen infotainment system in the dash, a far cry from the dial radio in your dad’s pickup. Knobs and controls are easier to reach than in past Tundras, and sturdy enough to be used with gloves on.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Tundra half-ton pickup is available in three cab configurations and three bed lengths. Regular-cab and double-cab models can be had with a standard bed (78.7 inches) or long bed (97.6 inches). The CrewMax has the biggest cab of the bunch and is only available with a short bed (66.7 inches). As part of last year’s revamp, the Tundra’s hood was raised slightly and better integrated into the grille. As with other full-size trucks, the Toyota’s grille appears to just get bigger and bigger. At the other end, the lockable tailgate automatically lowers slowly to prevent the dreaded tailgate slam.
Favorite FeaturesREPLACEABLE BUMPER PANELSTreat a truck like a truck and it’s almost bound to happen: bruising a bumper. The 2015 Toyota Tundra features a 3-piece design for its front and rear bumpers that makes them easier and less costly to replace should/when they get banged up.
BLIND-SPOT MONITORING SYSTEMDriving a big truck means dealing with a wider zone in which you can miss spotting vehicles to the rear left and rear right. Sedans have been offering electronic monitoring of these areas for years, but Toyota claims the title of being first to bring the technology to a full-size truck.
Standard FeaturesEven if you buy the least expensive version of the 2015 Tundra, you’ll get a nicely equipped truck with a V8 engine, rearview camera, power windows and door locks, and 6.1-inch touch-screen audio/entertainment system with AM/FM/CD player, USB and auxiliary inputs and Bluetooth wireless phone connectivity. These models also come with a fabric-trimmed 40/20/40-split fold-down front bench seat with 4-way adjustable driver and passenger seats (tough vinyl is available with the Work Truck package). All new Toyotas also come with two years/25,000 miles of complimentary factory-scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsMost extras for the 2015 Tundra are bundled into trims. SR5 models add a larger, 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, sliding rear window and the new storage compartment under the rear seats, while Limited trims bring premium audio and navigation, leather-trimmed and heated front bucket seats, 20-inch wheels, chrome mirrors and door handles, and power-operated sliding rear window. The top-line Platinum and 1794 Edition offer heated and cooled front seats, moonroof, JBL premium audio and blind-spot monitoring. The TRD Pro Off-Road package, available in double-cab or CrewMax form, includes Bilstein shocks, TRD-tuned springs with a 2-inch lift in front, front skidplate and unique badging.
Engine & Transmission2015 Tundra models are now powered solely by V8 engines since the former base V6 has been dropped. The 4.6-liter V8 is now the standard engine in lower-trim models, while the powerful-yet-thirsty 5.7-liter is available across all Tundra models and is standard on higher trims of Toyota’s full-size truck. Both V8s are connected to a 6-speed automatic. All Tundra engines run on regular gasoline, and the big 5.7-liter V8 is E85-capable. The Tundra’s maximum towing rating is 10,500 pounds and applies to a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) regular-cab model with the 5.7-liter V8. Additionally, models with that engine can be had with an integrated trailer brake controller.

As Toyota’s full-size truck, the 2015 Tundra aims for attention in a segment rife with entrenched players and brand loyalists. Capturing the limelight – and buyers’ allegiance – is no easy task, and not just because the segment has long been dominated by GM, Ram and America’s best-selling vehicle, the Ford F-150. Where power used to be a pickup’s calling card, the Tundra’s rivals are now in a race to be the most sophisticated and efficient. Toyota’s flagship truck addressed aspects of the former with last year’s revamp, but has yet to update its aging powertrains. The Tundra’s V8 engine choices are powerful, but neither cracks 20 mpg. What the Tundra does have on its side is strong resale value and a history of reliability.

The standard-issue automatic transmission is now the excellent 8-speed we’ve enjoyed in the Chrysler 300. Here, it helps even the V6 SXT achieve new performance heights. But let’s be honest: The Hellcat is the one everyone’s talking about. Its prodigious power makes the tremendous acceleration nearly impossible to explore on busy public roads. It has a stiff highway ride, but it’s no worse than, say, a Corvette. At a steady cruise the engine noise is subdued, with the supercharger whine a companion only as revs rise. Put the Hellcat and non-supercharged SRT Challengers into Track mode, and they transform with sharper throttle response, harder shifts from the automatic transmission, and stiffer shocks. Yup, this big boy can move.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Dodge Challenger finally gets the interior upgrade it has needed for years. The all-new dash incorporates the same 8.4-inch screen that we’ve enjoyed in the Dodge Charger and other Dodge and Chrysler vehicles. The retro-style gauges look fantastic, and there’s another sharp-display TFT screen nestled between the two. Luckily, all the good stuff is still there, too. There’s plenty of room in front for two, and the rear seat can accommodate three passengers, the only muscle car capable of making that claim. The trunk is surprisingly large and useful, despite a pretty high liftover.
Exterior StylingExterior changes to the 2015 Dodge Challenger aren’t quite as radical as those inside, but they’re enough to draw a bright line between this year and its predecessor. The new headlights are nestled in a revised vertically split grille, reminiscent of the classic 1971 Challenger. The taillights are now LEDs, and are also styled after that 1971 classic. SRT models get a cold-air intake on the hood, and the SRT Hellcat actually loses two headlights, with the driver’s side high beam replaced with a ram-air intake. Through all the changes, the classic profile and proportions remain, to our delight.
Favorite Features707-HORSEPOWER HELLCATGrab your red key fob, and the Challenger SRT Hellcat out-powers the most powerful versions of the Chevy Camaro and Ford Mustang with 707 horsepower. If that’s too much for every day, a black key fob dials it back to ""only"" 500 horsepower; a valet mode dials it back further.
NEW INTERIORWhile the Challenger has always been a great place to pass the time, the interior has been at best boring, and at worst cheap feeling. The new one incorporates all the modern screens and gadgets we see in other Dodge products, with a style unique to the Challenger.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Dodge Challenger lineup starts at the base SXT model with a V6 engine. In addition, you get Uconnect infotainment with its 5.0-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, a USB and auxiliary input, and six speakers. SXT models also come with a 6-way power driver’s seat and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, plus dual-zone automatic climate control. Keyless entry and push-button start are also standard equipment, as is advanced instrumentation with a 7-inch TFT screen between the gauges. All Challengers also come with multiple airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag.
Factory OptionsBeyond choosing various V8 engines with the R/T, SRT and SRT Hellcat models, there are numerous upgrades available for the 2015 Challenger. These include new option packages, such as a Technology Group that adds forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control. There’s also a Driver Convenience Group that includes HID headlights, backup sensors, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-path detection, helpful considering the Challenger’s rear view is, well, challenging. Then there are optional models like the R/T or 392 Hemi Shaker, with their above-hood intakes, and the 6.4-liter Scat Pack. These add visual punch to the already impressive performance.
Engine & TransmissionCounting the SRT models, there are four different powertrain options for the 2015 Dodge Challenger. Standard on SXT models is the 3.6-liter V6, making 305 horsepower. Next up is the 5.7-liter Hemi in R/T models, which makes 375 horsepower with a 6-speed manual transmission or 372 with the 8-speed automatic. The 392 Hemi Scat Pack and Challenger SRT 392 share the same 485-horsepower 6.4-liter V8. Then there’s the SRT Hellcat, with its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 putting out 707 horsepower, the first factory-supercharged Hemi that has ever come out of Dodge. Available with all V8 engines is a 6-speed manual gearbox, and it’s a lot of fun to be sure, but the new 8-speed automatic is a quick-shifting delight that doesn’t shortchange drivers on performance.

Driving the Used 2015 Kia OptimaDeriving a favorable impression of the 2015 Kia Optima sedan requires only about five minutes behind the wheel, an open road and no salesman along to spoil your fun. The base 2.4-liter engine delivers a smooth, quiet and willing performance while sipping gasoline. Despite the car’s racy appearance, the Optima’s suspension is set up more for comfort than cornering, and not quite up to the standards set by the Ford Fusion and Chrysler 200. Around town, the steering is heavily weighted, but at cruising speeds it feels quite nice. The Optima Hybrid uses the same 2.4-liter engine, only it’s paired with an electric motor that significantly improves both efficiency and off-the-line acceleration. Unlike some competitors, the Optima doesn’t make a V6 engine or AWD available, but the SX trim does offer a robust 274-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine that turns this comfortable cruiser into an asphalt abusing bruiser.
Interior ComfortOn upper-end EX and SX trims, customers can opt for such extravagant features as a dual-panel moonroof, heated and cooling front seats, heated rear seats and a voice-activated navigation and infotainment system similar to Ford’s SYNC. While we love the look of the 2015 Kia Optima sedan’s interior, some of the plastic on the dash and steering wheel still lack the quality look and feel found in Honda, Mazda and even some GM and Ford products. The front seats are pretty comfortable for tall folks, but the Optima’s sharply raked rear roofline may cause some headroom issues for the rear-seat passengers.
Exterior StylingLooking a bit like something from the sci-fi movie Tron, Kia’s 2015 Optima is a bold and original piece of work from the ground up. From its cross-hatch front grille and long sweptback headlight housing, to the red brake calipers on the SX-T trim, the Optima looks like it’s going fast even when it’s parked. There is a duality about the Optima sedan for 2015, speaking to both luxury and performance all while masking its true nature to serve duty as a humble family sedan. Even base trims offer such nice features as heated side mirrors, chrome door-handle inserts and 16-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesEXTERIOR STYLINGEven though the design is a few years old, the 2015 Kia Optima sedan still looks as fresh and new as the day it first arrived. We think it looks even better than some luxury sedans costing twice as much.
TURBOCHARGED 2.0-LITER ENGINEV6? We don’t need no stinking V6! The Optima’s available 2.0-liter turbocharged engine delivers 274 horsepower for a thrilling 0-to-60-mph run, yet still earns an EPA-estimated 31 mpg on the highway.
Standard FeaturesEvery 2015 Kia Optima family sedan offers Bluetooth phone connectivity, iPod/USB audio connectivity, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, heated side mirrors, fog lights, tilt/telescopic steering column, 6-way power driver’s seat and a cooling glove box that keeps drinks chilled. As for safety, the Optima has an impressive array of features including six airbags and electronic stability control. Like other base-priced models in its class, the entry-level Optima includes 16-inch steel wheels and a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Factory OptionsOptional equipment includes a panoramic moonroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, Nappa leather seating, 8-speaker Infinity sound system, HID headlights, LED fog lights, touch-screen navigation system, push-button start with Smart Key, UVO2 infotainment voice-active system, Blind Spot Detection and rearview camera. In addition to a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, the top SX and SX Limited models offer a lightly sport-tuned suspension and more aggressive styling cues. The 2015 Optima Hybrid features lightweight wheels in standard 16-inch or sporty 17-inch size, as well as the EcoMinder LCD panel with graphics that show when the car is achieving maximum fuel economy.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Kia Optima sedan doesn’t offer the option of a V6, and why should it? The standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder is nearly as powerful as some V6 engines and gets far better fuel economy. In fact, it has more power and better fuel economy than some 4-cylinder cars in the category, as well. Those wanting more power can opt for the turbocharged 2.0 liter (SX trims only). Only one transmission is offered: a 6-speed Sportronic automatic with manual-shift mode. However, on SX trims a Drive Mode Select option adjusts the transmission’s shift points and the power steering input to better suit the driver’s needs. The Optima Hybrid uses the 2.4-liter engine mated to a 40-horsepower electric motor for a combined output of 206 horsepower.

Stealing away one of Germany’s most prized automotive designers is only half the reason for Kia’s recent success.

The Abarth model will give the Mini Cooper a run for its money, too.","ConsThe 2015 Fiat 500 coupe and convertible are unknown commodities, meaning they have yet to earn the track record of cars like the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit and Mazda2. The 500’s diminutive size might also exclude bigger drivers or those who need room for additional passengers.",17000,"Driving the Used 2015 FIAT 500The 2015 Fiat 500 subcompact coupe doesn’t weigh much, which is why its engine only needs about 101 horsepower to move it along. While top speed and rapid acceleration aren’t the 500’s strong suit, the 500 can scoot about with relative ease and its go-kart like handling make even the shortest drives feel like a sporty adventure. The 500’s steering is precise, the brakes are strong and the manual transmission is so good, it might actually spark a movement back to the days when everyone knew how to stir their own gears. Those who don’t care to live in the past will find the 500’s 6-speed automatic equally enjoyable. The 160-horsepower turbocharged Abarth steps up the 500’s game by a notch or two, while the all-electric 500e makes the perfect urban commuter, capable of traveling up to 87 miles on a single charge.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Fiat 500 subcompact is roomier up front than you might expect, and just as tight in back as it looks. The interior style lives up to the promise of the quirky but fashionable exterior, and we found the materials, build quality and seat comfort impressive for a car with a starting price around $17,000. As the athlete of the group, the Fiat 500 Abarth offers aggressively bolstered front seats, exclusive red stitching and a thick-rimmed, flat-bottom steering wheel.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Fiat 500 is a modern interpretation of 1957’s tiny, rear-engined original. Although larger than the original, it’s still seven inches shorter than today’s Mini Cooper. The iconic sloping rear end is a big part of the 500’s personality, though it limits rear headroom. The Fiat 500 is available in a stretched 4-door model that alleviates many of the coupe’s shortcomings. The hatchback offers Pop, Sport, Lounge and Turbo trim levels, while the soft-top 500c comes in Pop and Lounge. The Turbo, Abarth and 500e electric are their own packages. Wheels, fascias and body trim differentiate the models.
Favorite FeaturesINTELLIGENT POWER CONVERTIBLE TOPThe convertible Fiat 500c employs a rather unconventional power top. Instead of folding to expose the entire cabin, the 500c’s top rolls back on a track leaving a protective metal frame in place. The top can be opened in just 15 seconds at speed up to 60 mph.
Eco:DRIVEDr. Dolittle could talk to the animals and now your 500 can talk to you. Using a flash drive, the 500 can upload data about everything from CO2 emissions to trip information. When plugged into your laptop, the data can be used to help you learn how to drive more efficiently.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Fiat 500 and 500c Pop include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15-inch covered steel wheels, a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, cruise control, power window/locks/mirrors, Bluetooth, and a 6-speaker audio system with a USB port for portable music players. The range-topping Abarth variant includes a Bose premium audio system, 16-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension and a leather-wrapped dashboard. Standard safety features include seven airbags, hill-start assist to help prevent vehicle rollback on steep inclines and seemingly all the other advancements we’re seeing on new cars in this price range and beyond.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded 2015 Fiat 500 Lounge includes a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather seats, heated front seats, rear parking sensors, Bose audio system and automatic climate control. The 500 Sport model is differentiated by a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch wheels and a variety of aesthetic touches including red brake calipers and a subtle rear spoiler. The Turbo model adds larger front brakes and more serious suspension tuning to go with its specific 16-inch wheels and identifying trim. The mighty Abarth offers larger 17-inch wheels, 2-tone leather-trimmed seats and your choice of either white or red body side stripes.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive 2015 Fiat 500 is motivated by a small but sophisticated 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine using Fiat’s patented MultiAir technology, which varies intake-valve timing and lift. Fiat tunes this engine to three power levels: The base hatchback and cabriolet get 101 horsepower (naturally aspirated), the Turbo makes 135 horsepower and the Abarth, also turbocharged, crank out 160 horsepower. The 500e electric is rated for 111 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. All of the 500s now offer the choice of a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. We like the automatic for its extra ratio and responsive shifting though it does cut fuel efficiency by more than 10 percent. The 500e uses a single-speed automatic.

Streaming Bluetooth and an additional USB port are also new this year.
Many didn’t expect a small Italian subcompact to do well in the U.S., but the 2015 Fiat 500 coupe and soft-top cabriolet have confounded the critics. Smaller than the Mini Cooper and Ford Fiesta, the 500’s primary attraction are its playful attitude, impressive list of colors and features, attractive price and good fuel economy. Of course, those not interested in cute also have a friend in the 500, that being the performance-oriented Abarth model. Even environmentalists have a seat at the table, thanks to the all-electric Fiat 500e. Now, if only we could get more car companies to see the wisdom of adding color and cleverness to their most affordable models.

Most buyers will opt for the automatic transmission, an extra $1,000. A base Accent 5-door hatchback begins around $15,800, and the top-line Sport about $17,300. Fully loaded, a Hyundai Accent Sport 5-door can pass $19,000. It’s easy to see the Accent’s economic appeal. Yet the Accent’s own cousin, the Kia Rio, starts lower, as do the Nissan Versa sedan and Versa Note hatchback. Also lower are the Ford Fiesta, Chevy Sonic and Mitsubishi Mirage, while rivals starting nearer the Accent include the Toyota Yaris and Mazda2. The Honda Fit hatchback is slightly higher. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. The Hyundai’s Accent resale value is predicted to lag most rivals and trail far behind the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa Note.
Driving the Used 2015 Hyundai AccentFor the most part, today’s economy cars are no longer ""penalty boxes,"" and that’s certainly true for the Hyundai Accent. Whether driving on congested inner-city streets or an open highway, Hyundai’s lowest-priced car left us feeling content. The Accent’s frugal 4-cylinder isn’t stingy when it comes to power, but we were disappointed by the rubbery and vague 6-speed manual transmission. We instead recommend the 6-speed automatic that provides smooth and precise shifts without any significant loss in fuel economy. The Hyundai Accent’s seats are comfortable and supportive, but rear-seat legroom is tight. If the Accent has a weak spot, it’s in driving dynamics, or lack thereof. We weren’t expecting VW GTI-like maneuvers, but in a matchup with the Ford Fiesta or Mazda2, the Accent was far more at home on the highway than the twisty roads that beckon those more dynamic rivals.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Hyundai Accent’s 5-passenger interior layout isn’t all that exciting, but it is functional. Controls for audio, climate and phone connectivity are easy to locate and use. The backlit buttons and knobs are a nice touch and especially useful at night. Sedan versions of the Accent have a 13.7-cubic-foot trunk and 60/40-split folding rear seats to accommodate larger items. But the real cargo-carrying hero in this lineup is the Accent hatchback, which offers 47.5 cubic feet of capacity with the seats folded – nearly as much as a small SUV.
Exterior StylingUsing the same ""fluidic sculpture"" design language incorporated into other newer Hyundai models, the 2015 Accent hatchback and sedan stand out with dynamic and sculptural lines that give this subcompact an upscale look. A newly styled grille, headlights and taillights help keep Hyundai’s subcompact looking fresh, especially in 5-door hatchback form. Accent Sport 5-door models look the most appealing with satin chrome door handles, rear spoiler, fog lights and side mirrors with integrated turn signals. Speaking of mirrors, the driver’s side blind-spot mirror aids visibility.
Favorite FeaturesGENEROUS WARRANTYOne of the most appealing aspects of all new Hyundai models is a feature you hope to never use: the warranty. But if you do, there’s no beating this one, which includes five-years/60,000-miles basic coverage and 10 years/100,000 miles for powertrain components like the engine and transmission.
STANDARD 172-WATT AUDIO SYSTEMThe 2015 Accent comes with a 172-watt, 6-speaker audio system featuring SiriusXM satellite radio and USB/iPod and auxiliary ports. Optional is Bluetooth connectivity that allows music streaming.
Standard FeaturesThe Hyundai Accent is available in three trims: the sedan-only GLS, and the GS and Sport hatchbacks. All come with air conditioning, power windows and door locks, 172-watt AM/FM/CD/MP3/satellite radio with USB/iPod integration, 6-way adjustable driver’s seat, folding rear seats and heated outside mirrors. The top-line Accent Sport is the best dressed of the bunch, with standard tilt and telescoping steering wheel, automatic headlights, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, 16-inch wheels and sport-tuned steering, leather-covered shift knob and steering wheel, and high-gloss interior accents. In addition to that generous warranty, new Hyundais come with five years/unlimited miles of 24-hour roadside assistance.
Factory OptionsAll 2015 Accent trims can be had with a 6-speed automatic transmission in lieu of the 6-speed manual. Most other major extras are bundled into packages. If buying the Accent sedan, we recommend spending the extra $600 on the Popular Equipment Package that includes cruise control, Bluetooth, telescoping steering wheel and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls. A Style Package adds upgraded cloth interior, fog lights, rear disc brakes, 16-inch alloy wheels and projector headlights with LED accents. Both packages are tied to Accent sedans with automatic transmissions. The top-line Accent Sport hatchback with automatic transmission can be had with a power sunroof.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2015 Hyundai Accent models use a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine with gasoline direct injection (GDI) that translates to satisfying throttle response. Offering 137 horsepower and up to 38 mpg, this little engine puts out a good blend of power and efficiency. All Accent models are front-wheel drive and use a standard 6-speed manual transmission or the more recommendable and popular 6-speed automatic transmission with Hyundai’s Shiftronic manual control.

It’s loud, the suspension is stiff, and it’s short on creature comforts. That’s fine for off-road, but for around town, look elsewhere.",23500,"Driving the Used 2015 Jeep WranglerWith front and rear solid axles and body-on-frame construction, the 2015 Jeep Wrangler is downright primitive by modern standards. But that’s what makes it work so well off road. There’s generous ground clearance, minimal overhangs, and that distinctive Jeep look, of course. Being equipped with 4-wheel drive, the Wrangler is nearly unstoppable off road. Yet in spite of its off-road bias, it’s not quite as bad as you might imagine on pavement. The suspension deals with pavement irregularities as well as it deals with off-road bumps and ruts, and the precise steering is as welcome off-pavement as on. Still, it’s ridiculously loud at highway speeds, and its barnlike aerodynamics means you’ll use a lot of gas to not go very fast. So just drive it to the trails, where you’ll slow down and take advantage of the excellent Pentastar V6 engine and the Wrangler’s legendary off-road capability.
Interior ComfortVery little about the Jeep Wrangler’s interior conveys a sense of elegance or status. The Sport’s cloth seats are durable, as are the numerous hard plastics throughout the interior. While it’s true the higher trim levels offer leather seats, and a 9-speaker Alpine audio system is available, they add comfort, not outright luxury. That said, the rear seat folds flat for extra cargo space, and the 4-door Unlimited models offer plenty of rear-seat room for three people, plus twice the cargo space behind the rear seats as the standard 2-door Wrangler.
Exterior StylingThere’s no mistaking the 2015 Jeep Wrangler’s unmistakable styling for anything other than a Jeep. The box-on-wheels shape was originally designed for ease of manufacture; now Jeep doesn’t dare alter it any more than Elvis could let himself go blonde. The upright windshield isn’t just easy to see out of, it also folds down for those times off road when you need to lean over the hood. The wheels are pushed to the corners, giving the Wrangler unmatched approach and departure angles. About the only changes are to trim and appearance packages, like the Willys Wheeler or the Rubicon Hard Rock.
Favorite Features3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6Chrysler’s Pentastar V6 is the best thing to happen to the Jeep Wrangler since aftermarket winches. With smooth operation, nice throttle response and even decent highway fuel economy, it’s just about as perfectly suited as it can be. In addition to the 5-speed automatic, there’s a 6-speed manual available.
COMMANDING OFF-ROAD CAPABILITYIf you’re not buying a Jeep Wrangler for its off-road capability, then you’re simply doing it wrong. The ground clearance, the solid axles, the short overhangs…all of it combine to make the Wrangler excel at its task.
Standard FeaturesTwo things are standard on every 2015 Jeep Wrangler: A 285-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine, and 4-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case. Beyond that, you get stability control with roll mitigation, hill-start assist and trailer sway control. New this year is a Torx Tool Kit, which includes T-30, T-35, T-40 and T-50 wrenches to remove the top and doors. What aren’t standard are power windows and door locks. Nor do you get standard air conditioning on base models.
Factory OptionsThe options list for the 2015 Jeep Wrangler is extensive, and again, aimed at the Jeep’s core audience. For example, you have a choice of final-drive ratios, with the lower-number axle ratio offering better fuel economy and lower engine rpm for a quieter ride, while the higher number enables better acceleration, and climbing and towing ability. You’ll find most of the extras in option packages, like the Black Steel and 31-inch Dueler Tire packages. But there are others, like the Freedom III Package, Trail Kit and Trailer-Tow Package. There’s also a huge aftermarket industry of third-party parts and accessories.
Engine & TransmissionThere’s only one engine available for the 2015 Jeep Wrangler: a terrific 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, with 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Its smooth power delivery makes easy work of highways or rock crawls, and it’s easily the best engine ever in a Wrangler. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard, and a 5-speed automatic is available as an option. In the 2-door Wrangler, there’s no difference in fuel economy between the two.

There are few vehicles that have remained as faithful to their origins like the 2015 Jeep Wrangler SUV. Despite decades of development, multiple iterations and even necessary nods to modern technology, the Wrangler remains true to its hard-earned and thoroughly deserved reputation as the universal standard for off-road vehicles. There’s something here for anybody who wants off-road utility, from the simple and inexpensive 2-door Sport with a soft top, to the go-anywhere Rubicon. The longer Wrangler Rubicon SUV offers four doors and a more usable back seat, but it does it all with the same off-road prowess as the original. All come with Chrysler’s excellent Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 engine. Competition? Maybe the Toyota 4Runner or Nissan XTerra, but neither SUV has the Jeep Wrangler’s off-road chops.

The Porsche Boxster for 2015 conveys the same sexy exterior and passion for the road as its 911 kin, but without the exorbitant price tag. Now in its third generation, the 2015 Boxster is slightly larger than previous versions, but it is no less competent. The Boxster’s impressive road manners don’t come at the cost of comfort or convenience, with a luxurious cabin and a padded power soft top that can be activated at speeds up to 31 mph. While it lacks the hardtop convenience of a BMW Z4 or Mercedes-Benz SLK, the Boxster’s interior remains impressively quiet. On the flip side, you can achieve nearly equal levels of performance in the less expensive Nissan 370Z or all-wheel-drive (AWD) Audi TT.

Ladle on options, and your bottom line can swell by tens of thousands of dollars. At its starting price, the Porsche Boxster is several thousand dollars higher than that of the Mercedes-Benz SLK, Audi TT roadster and BMW Z4, but far below the Jaguar’s brilliant F-Type, which starts around $70,000.

Driving the Used 2015 Porsche BoxsterWith power always at the ready and a rigid structure to resist body flex, Porsche’s 2015 Boxster roadster delivers on every promise one would expect from such a car. Massive brakes ensure impressive stopping power, even after repeated testing. That’s good, because the speeds generated by the Boxster’s mid-mounted 6-cylinder engine are equally impressive. The old school of our group loved the 6-speed manual, but were also impressed by the rapid-fire manual shifts performed with the PDK automatic. We’ve heard mixed reviews about the Boxster’s variable-ratio electric power-steering unit, but found nothing to dislike on our test drive. In fact, we formed consensus that the Porsche Boxster is one of the easiest sports cars to live with on a day-to-day basis. Whether at the track or on a quick jaunt up the coast for dinner, the Boxster feels like an old pair of well-worn jeans, but on wheels.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Boxster’s cabin is surprisingly quiet with the top up and triumphantly alive with it down. It’s also the roomiest ever. The two seats don’t so much fit you as they absorb you. All touch points, including the pedals and leather-trimmed steering wheel and shifter, are as purposeful as they are comfortable. This is what a sports car should feel like. In the center dash is a 7-inch color screen that sits above a bevy of buttons, and growing from there is the sleek and also-button-laden transmission tunnel that sits between driver and passenger. It’s high-tech and classy, but busy.
Exterior StylingAs good as Porsche’s 2015 Boxster appears in photos, it looks better in person, boasting more angles than a geometry lesson. Not surprisingly, the Boxster is at its best with the top down, but even with the fabric roof in position, this roadster draws attention. Among the Boxster’s more prominent features are sculpted side sills that direct air to the engine bay. In front, the Boxster dazzles with jeweled headlights, which are bi-xenon for S and GTS trims. In back is the traditional center-mounted exhaust tailpipe, a single outlet on base models and a pair on the S and GTS.
Favorite FeaturesQUICK FOLDING TOPThe beauty of a soft top is that it not only weighs less than a hardtop, it folds faster. In just nine seconds the 2015 Boxster will have the wind in your hair and sun in your face. Even better, the Boxster’s roof can be operated at speeds up to 31 mph.
SPORT CHRONO PACKAGEOrder your 2015 Porsche Boxster roadster with an automatic transmission and you can also opt for the Sport Chrono Package. Along with adding a Sport Plus button to tighten the suspension settings, the package includes a cool analog/digital stopwatch in the dash.
Standard FeaturesOther than the fact that the base Porsche Boxster sport seats are manually adjustable for height and fore/aft positioning (the seatback recline adjustment is electric) in a world where most luxury makers go all-electric, the 2015 Boxster comes deliciously equipped right out of the box. The power-folding roof features a heated glass window, and the included HomeLink garage door opener means you’ll never have to dig for that transponder. The standard 50-watt audio system has four speakers and is controlled via a 7-inch, color touch screen. Base Boxsters come with 18-inch wheels, S models have 19s and GTS ride on 20-inchers.
Factory OptionsFrom a torque-vectoring rear differential to ventilated seats and a navigation system, there are myriad ways to make your Boxster quicker, more comfortable, or more technologically advanced. High-end audio systems from Bose and Burmester are available, and an electronic logbook can record every trip for posterity or recordkeeping. We are personal fans of the wood package and matching heated, mahogany steering wheel. The most performance-minded will be interested in the carbon-ceramic brakes, a $7,000-plus feature alone. And there is, of course, that excellent 7-speed automatic transmission. It’s officially named Porsche Doppelkupplung, but it’s far easier to just say ""PDK.""
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Porsche Boxster roadster uses a 2.7-liter flat-6 engine that puts out a respectable 265 horsepower and enables the roadster to leap from zero to 60 mph in a scant 5.5 seconds. The Boxster S features a more powerful 3.4-liter flat-6 that produces 315 horsepower and lowers that acceleration benchmark to a rapid 4.8 seconds. The GTS adds another 15 horsepower. This last powerplant simply doesn’t have a weakness and roars like a warhorse. Both engines are mounted midship and power the rear wheels. The standard transmission is a 6-speed manual, with the quicker-shifting and more fuel-efficient 7-speed PDK automatic optional. An auto start/stop function can be used with either transmission, but we found the startups jarring when faced with a row of ill-timed stoplights.

A larger SUV, such as a Honda Pilot, Chevrolet Traverse or GMC Yukon, might make a better choice.",24995,"Driving the Used 2015 Kia SorentoWhile the Kia Sorento for 2015 may not have the vast interior space of some competitors, it gains advantages from its more maneuverable size and sporty chassis. Seven inches shorter and with a smaller wheelbase than the Honda Pilot, the Sorento has no problem fitting into tight parking spaces and its tight turning radius makes it less ponderous when negotiating crowded parking structures. Get the Sorento out on the open road and the 290-horsepower V6 and seamless-shifting 6-speed automatic deliver smooth and responsive performance, yet return surprisingly good fuel economy figures. On our long-term test drive, we found the Sorento’s seats to be comfortable and supportive and the driving experience very relaxing, with none of the fatigue that is sometimes a trait of larger, truck-like SUVs.
Interior ComfortInterior highlights from the well-equipped 2015 Kia Sorento models we’ve driven include small touches, such as a leather transmission selector boot, and unexpected features, including an LCD speedometer, retractable 2nd-row window shades and a huge panoramic sunroof. Combined with a next-gen level of refinement for Kia, you’ll have a hard time finding a nicer interior for the money. The Sorento definitely gives up some passenger and cargo room to just about every other 3-row SUV worth considering, but a rear seat that slides, reclines and folds down in 40/20/40 sections adds valuable flexibility. The optional third row is best reserved for little ones.
Exterior StylingSubtle changes for the 2015 Sorento include a choice of anodized silver metal or black mesh grille and a wider crosshatch lower air intake. The Sorento’s headlights offer an LED design element, the exterior mirrors will fold in at the push of a button and the exterior door pockets light up to welcome you back at night. Stepping all the way up to the SX Limited nets xenon HID headlights, unique 19-inch wheels and red brake calipers, but even the base models have a finished look that includes 17-inch aluminum wheels.
Favorite FeaturesUVO eSERVICESKia’s UVO voice-activated system allows for smartphone integration with the existing audio and navigation setup, allowing an owner to plot a trip from a home computer and then send that information to the car’s navigation system. UVO can also automatically dial 911 in the event of an airbag deployment.
FLEXSTEERKia’s driver-selectable steering system, dubbed FlexSteer, allows for three settings: Comfort, Normal and Sport. Each setting is designed to enhance the driving experience, depending upon driver preference, although we found the Comfort mode to be the least artificial and most enjoyable of the three.
Standard FeaturesA base model 2015 Kia Sorento LX comes with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive and two rows of cloth seats. Standard-feature highlights include Bluetooth and USB phone/audio connectivity, air conditioning, cruise control and steering wheel-mounted controls. Outside, alloy wheels, body-color side mirrors and LED taillights help the entry-priced Sorento present about as well as the pricier trim levels. The full complement of electronic and inflatable safety equipment is also standard.
Factory OptionsA 2015 Kia Sorento SX has all of Kia’s best features on display, including a powerful V6 engine and all-wheel drive, leather seats (heated and cooled in front), three rows of seating, a panoramic moonroof, keyless entry and touch-start, blind-spot monitoring and the full UVO eServices infotainment setup, including an 8-inch touch-screen display, navigation and a 10-speaker Infinity audio system. For an additional $3,000 you can step up to the SX Limited, with softer Nappa leather, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and a handful of exterior touches.
Engine & TransmissionBecause the 4-cylinder engine isn’t markedly cheaper or more efficient than the V6, and because the V6’s 290 horsepower is a lot to feed through only the front wheels, we recommend the 2015 Kia Sorento with its new V6 engine and all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system features a locking center differential for especially difficult conditions and incorporates a new Torque Vectoring Cornering Control system that further enhances drivability. All Sorento configurations offer the same 6-speed, manually-selectable automatic transmission.

Read Full Review","What's New?Changes to the Kia Sorento SUV for 2015 are mild and include minor alterations to the grille and front end, the addition of a navigation option without having to upgrade to UVO and the Infinity sound system, and a more fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engine.
Kia gave the Sorento SUV a thorough makeover last year, enhancing its chassis, engines and interior. For 2015, the Sorento continues with only a few minor improvements designed to make it even more appealing to tech- and fashion-conscious buyers. The Sorento’s 7-passenger flexibility makes it ideal for growing families, but Kia also offers a 5-passenger option that allows for more generous permanent cargo space. Although the Sorento scores big in the areas of power, safety and fuel economy, its biggest attraction is the amazing amount of features offered for the money. Because of its flexible seating, the Sorento can be cross-shopped with a number of popular models, including the Ford Edge, Dodge Journey, Toyota Highlander and Nissan Pathfinder.

Premium models are a better starting point, and cost about $41,000, while sporty S models start at about $44,500. If you want all-wheel drive, you’ll add about $1,800 to the price of your Q50. If you’re looking for more power and/or better fuel economy, the Infiniti Q50 Hybrid starts at the Premium level, at a price a little above $45,000. A Hybrid S with all-wheel drive will run you close to $50,000. A 6-cylinder BMW 3335i starts at more than $45,000, while a 6-cylinder Mercedes-Benz C400 with standard all-wheel drive costs nearly $50,000. Even the Cadillac CTS 3.6 Luxury starts higher, at about $42,000. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying, and note that the Q50 sedan should retain excellent long-term value.
Driving the Used 2015 INFINITI Q50We love how the V6 under the Infiniti Q50’s hood pours out plenty of power and torque, even if it does get a bit raspy at higher revs. The Q50 Hybrid offers even more power, and most Q50 models can be equipped with all-wheel drive. Out on the road, there’s little need for any extra power, and the Q50’s suspension is equally good at tackling day-to-day commutes as it is at bringing a more aggressive mountain road to its knees. Despite the technological prowess of the drive-by-wire Direct Adaptive Steering system (DAS), we prefer the standard steering system’s more linear feedback. DAS is optional on the non-hybrid Q50, but if you want the extra power of the 360-horsepower Q50 Hybrid, you’re getting DAS whether you want it or not. If you’re looking for extra driving fun, Sport models feature unique seats with manual thigh extenders and adjustable side bolsters for the driver.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Infiniti Q50 takes touch-screen input to a new extreme by using two separate screens. They work in tandem – for example, the upper screen will show your map, while the lower screen allows you to input a destination. It’s an eye-catching high-tech solution, but not everyone is a fan. However, the rest of the interior is comfortable and luxurious, with the kind of high-quality materials throughout that are expected in a modern luxury car. The rear seat is a bit tighter, but even though sedans like this can seat five, they rarely do.
Exterior StylingWhile both Lexus and Infiniti have been stretching their styling envelope lately, Infiniti may have the better idea with the 2015 Q50. This sedan’s styling is bold, with a double-arch front grille that definitely makes a statement. However, it’s conservative enough that we won’t grow tired of it in a few years, which is a danger for the over-the-top aggressive grilles that Lexus has used lately. Other touches in the Infiniti Q50 include LED headlights, daytime running lights and taillights, plus a variety of wheels, including an available 19-inch set from Japanese aftermarket company RAYS.
Favorite FeaturesACTIVE LANE CONTROLUsing cameras, the Infiniti Q50 helps keep you in your lane, as do a lot of systems these days. However, the system also looks farther ahead for possible unintended lane drift, and helps compensate for different road surfaces and crosswinds.
STUDIO ON WHEELS BY BOSE AUDIOWhen you’re cruising to work or listening to your go-fast playlist, it’s critical to have it play through a great audio system. The Q50 sedan’s 14-speaker Studio on Wheels by Bose system delivers, with USB inputs and standard HD radio to further expand the listening experience.
Standard FeaturesBase-model 2015 Infiniti Q50 models get leatherette seating surfaces, power-adjustable driver and front-passenger seats, the dual touch-screen display, passive entry and push-button start, 6-speaker audio with HD radio and CD player, two USB and one auxiliary input, dual-zone automatic climate control, a backup camera, Bluetooth with voice recognition, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and the center-console-mounted Infiniti controller. In addition to the more powerful drivetrain and Direct Adaptive Steering, Infiniti Q50 Hybrid models also come with the Premium package. That adds leather upholstery, a moonroof, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, and other high-end creature comforts.
Factory OptionsThere’s seemingly no end to the available options on the 2015 Q50 and Q50 Hybrid. Leather seats and a moonroof are available, and a Technology Package adds in adaptive front lighting, Intelligent Cruise Control, Around View 360-degree monitor, blind-spot warning, lane departure warning and prevention, an Advanced Climate Control with Plasmacluster air purifier, and an Eco pedal that pushes back against you to help save fuel. Other options include navigation, Direct Adaptive Steering, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering column, and maple wood accents in the Deluxe Touring Package. Note that the hybrid model’s battery location deletes the pass-through to the trunk.
Engine & TransmissionTwo drivetrains are available for the 2015 Infiniti Q50. Standard is a 328-horsepower 3.7-liter V6, which features sophisticated technology designed to help increase power without hurting fuel economy. If you’re looking to save more fuel and increase your power at the same time – once an impossible task – the Q50 Hybrid uses combines a 3.5-liter V6 engine with an electric motor for a total of 360 horsepower. Both models are available with all-wheel drive, and both send power to their wheels through a 7-speed automatic transmission that features rev matching and manual shift mode.

With no V8 or diesel engine option, the Tacoma’s towing and fuel-economy figures are also limited.",21650,"Driving the Used 2015 Toyota Tacoma Access CabToyota’s Tacoma pickup for 2015 is easy to maneuver and park, thanks to its somewhat compact dimensions. The handling is predictable, with responsive steering and brakes. We did find the low front seats presented a problem for some drivers, and because the Tacoma is a body-on-frame truck its ride can feel rough, especially when compared to the more car-like Honda Pilot. Off-road models see their ride and handling measurably diminished, but their off-road abilities more than make up for any minor discomfort. In our tests, we found the 4-cylinder to be more than up to the task of daily drives and some light-load hauling, but we think the V6 is the engine of choice here. It offers superior power without much penalty in fuel economy. Manual-transmission lovers can opt for a 5-speed on the 4-cylinder or 6-speed on the V6; a 5- and 6-speed automatic are optional, respectively.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Toyota Tacoma compact pickup offers an interior that’s clean, functional and well-suited to the needs of truck owners. Instruments and controls are easy to see and use, and there are cup holders and other storage spots throughout. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, but sit somewhat low. The rear seats in the Access Cab model are best for children or adults on short trips, but the rear seats in the Double Cab are much better, with storage both under the seat and in a separate compartment accessed by flipping down the seatback.
Exterior StylingEven though it’s a compact, Toyota’s 2015 Tacoma pickup looks every inch a truck, with a rugged and muscular attitude, a big grille (chrome on higher-end trim levels), pronounced fender bulges, large bumpers and a generally workmanlike feel from front to rear. The base version has black bumpers and grille, the PreRunner has the off-road look, and the option packages, from SR5 Extra Value to TRD Pro Series to Limited, add their own details. As would be expected of Toyota, the quality, fit and finish are as good as it gets.
Favorite FeaturesSTRONG V6 ENGINEToyota builds one of the best V6 engines in the industry and they offer it in the 2015 Tacoma pickup. The 4.0-liter is smooth, powerful and returns acceptable fuel economy for the class, plus it can be paired with either a manual or automatic transmission.
FUNCTIONAL BEDEvery Tacoma compact pickup for 2015 includes a composite inner bed including a built-in storage compartment and four rail-mounted sliding tie-down cleats. What better way to keep your stuff securely stowed?
Standard FeaturesStandard equipment for the 2015 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab includes the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine of 159 horsepower and a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD system, tilt/telescopic steering wheel with audio controls, tachometer, two instrument-panel powerpoints and rear mudguards. Access Cab and Double Cab models include bucket seats with a center console, power mirrors, power windows and power door locks. All models include Entune Audio, which leverages a smartphone to provide fully integrated access to navigation, entertainment and information services. Standard safety features include six airbags, traction and stability control and ABS.
Factory OptionsMany of the options for the 2015 Toyota Tacoma are grouped into packages, and not all are available on every version of cab size or powertrain. Packages include the SR5 Extra Value Package, four TRD Off-Road Extra Value Packages, and the Limited Package. Among the major selections are the 4.0-liter V6 engine, the choice of a manual or an automatic transmission, and 4-wheel drive. Beyond that, the options are many and are linked with cab configurations, powertrain choices and trim levels.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard engine in the 2015 Toyota Tacoma is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder of 159 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It gets the job done but we prefer the available 4.0-liter V6 of 236 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, as it’s much stronger and smoother and its fuel-economy penalty is not unreasonable. Both engines feature Toyota’s Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i), which helps to reduce the compromise between higher-end horsepower and low-end torque. Depending upon engine and drivetrain, maximum towing capacity is 6,500 pounds and maximum payload is 1,500 pounds. There are four available transmissions, 2-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive (2WD or 4WD), two cab configurations, two cargo bed lengths and numerous other choices.

Toyota’s compact Tacoma pickup for 2015 carries on the long tradition of rugged durability, outstanding longevity, low cost of ownership and excellent resale value. Millions of happy customers have helped make Toyota’s Tacoma the most popular compact pickup in America, even though its current proportions actually move it squarely into the realm of a midsize pickup. As Ford and Ram have completely abandoned the compact/midsize pickup segment, the Tacoma’s only real competition comes from two rivals: Nissan and GM. Nissan’s Frontier is solid but doesn’t offer as many model variations. GM’s new Colorado and Canyon are vastly improved but remain untested. However, if the promise of a diesel engine comes to fruition, the pair will have a leg up on the aging Tacoma.

Those models also are available with more efficient diesel V6 engines.",74000,"Driving the Used 2015 Cadillac EscaladeWith a robust 6.2-liter V8 engine, the 2015 Escalade gets up and goes when you put the spurs into it. There’s more than enough pep to get around slower traffic with a quick tip-in of the throttle, and it sounds good while doing so. Available with 2-wheel drive (2WD) and 4-wheel drive 4WD), the new Escalade also features General Motors’ latest version of Magnetic Ride Control, which enables you to handle the full-size luxury SUV in a confident and controlled fashion. This function kicks into action when you tell it to by pressing a button on the lower left-hand side of the CUE infotainment system screen. According to Cadillac, the 2015 Escalade can also stop nine feet shorter than the one it’s replacing.
Interior ComfortBy far the biggest leap forward for the new Cadillac Escalade, the interior is now fit for a full-size luxury SUV boasting soft-touch materials as far as the eye can see. Cut and sewn leather and real wood give off a more refined feel – something missing from the Escalade as of late. All models can be had with a 2nd-row bench seat allowing seating for eight passengers in lieu of a pair of bucket seats and seating for seven. Third-row legroom is tight in standard models, but the extended-length 2015 Cadillac ESV model rectifies that while also offering considerably more cargo space behind the rear-most seats.
Exterior StylingWithout stating the obvious redesigned front and rear ends, the 2015 Escalade benefits from the addition of full-LED headlights and taillights. There are four crystals in the headlights that act as the high beams, giving off radiant light. The taillights also employ LEDs, making it easier to follow the Escalade when weather conditions are less than ideal. The option to load cargo through the rear window is still available as it opens up separately from tailgate itself. While originally installed for aerodynamic purposes, the spoiler also hides the rear windshield wiper blade. ESV models add even more length, coming in at a total of 224.3 inches compared to the 203.9 inches of the standard model.
Favorite FeaturesFOLD-FLAT 2ND- and 3RD-ROW SEATSWith all of the Escalade’s cavernous space, fold-flat seating is one feature you may not want to live without. With a simple touch of a button located in the cargo area, both the 2nd-row and 3rd-row seats fold flat, giving way to ample room.
INTERIORFor the first time in a while, the interior is one of the Escalade’s selling points. Sewn and cut materials line the cabin, giving it a luxury SUV feel, finally.
Standard FeaturesYou can’t miss the chrome grille, but you might not see the active-aero shutters behind it. Then there’s the heated, power-adjustable seats, 20-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels, and hands-free power liftgate. A remote starter, tri-zone climate control, and a reconfigurable instrument cluster further the Escalade’s appeal.
Factory OptionsLane Departure Warning, adaptive cruise control, side blind-zone alert, cross-traffic alert, and 22-inch machine finished wheels are all available on the 2015 Cadillac Escalade. For buyers seeking the most indulgence, the new range-topping Platinum line comes with Nappa semi-aniline leather, sueded microfiber headliner and climate-controlled 18-way front seats complete with massaging functionality for the driver’s side.
Engine & TransmissionYou have once choice when it comes to motivating the 2015 Cadillac Escalade, and that’s the 6.2-liter V8 engine rated at 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. For those keeping track, both power numbers are up over the model it’s replacing from 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, respectively. Initial versions of the 2015 Escalade used a 6-speed automatic transmission. Those built later in the model year were updated with a new 8-speed. Even with the new transmission, this engine gets parched quickly, and the EPA’s ratings of 15/22 mpg for the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) model and 15/21 mpg for the 4-wheel drive (4WD) variant reflect that. While premium gasoline is recommended, the Escalade’s engine doesn’t require it, so you can save a few cents at the pump.

Read Full Review","What's New?All-new for 2015, the Escalade boasts a redesigned interior and exterior, while fuel-economy figures climb slightly over the model it replaces. Versions built later in the 2015 model year have already been updated with an 8-speed automatic transmission, surround-view camera system and 4G LTE connectivity. The top-line Platinum edition also joins the collection.
The full-size luxury SUV segment has a lot to offer, but with an all-out redesign for the 2015 model year, the Cadillac Escalade has climbed back to the top of the pile. While other SUVs have decided to go smaller and more fuel efficient, the Escalade goes its own way, offering regular and long-wheelbase (ESV) models, with both powered by a 6.2-liter V8 engine. The all-new Escalade continues on with its boxy, bold profile and benefits from a redesigned interior which grants Cadillac’s biggest offering a spot on the must-see list. If you’re looking to seat eight in the lap of luxury, a ton of storage space, and a towing capacity of up to 8,300 pounds, the 2015 Cadillac Escalade would like to speak with you.

And while it wears the Jeep name, the Patriot is based on front-wheel-drive architecture and isn’t made to hop boulders like a Wrangler.",18000,"Used 2015 Jeep Patriot PricingThe 2015 Jeep Patriot has an alluring Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting under $17,500. That makes the Patriot the least expensive new SUV, but you’ll have to compromise on creature comforts such as power windows and air conditioning. Better-equipped versions run in the $20,000 range, and a top-line Limited with options can top $31,000. At these prices, most models of the Patriot still undercut the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and Subaru Forester, but all of those rivals are newer and generally more appealing. Still, there’s no denying that the Patriot is an inexpensive SUV to buy and own, and it’s just coming off a win for the Kelley Blue Book 5-Year Cost to Own Award in the Compact SUV/Crossover category. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Jeep Patriot. Long-term residual value is another aspect in which the 2015 Patriot lags competitors.
Driving the Used 2015 Jeep PatriotJeeps have long been regarded more for their off-road capability than on-road comfort. Most models of the Patriot, though, don’t stand out in either setting. While it’s true you can get a Patriot that is Trail-Rated to get through mud, snow and up to 19 inches of water, one must option up to the Freedom Drive II package in order to do so. On the asphalt where most Patriots will roam, Jeep’s least expensive SUV is simply outclassed by newer rivals that offer better performance, handling and ride quality. Neither of the Patriot’s 4-cylinder engines feels very strong, and the CVT transmission does more for fuel economy than it does for performance, although the 6-speed automatic helps improve the latter. Highway ride and handling are okay, as long as you don’t compare the Patriot to a more refined small SUV – of which there are plenty.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Jeep Patriot features a 2-row, 5-passenger interior. Depending on trim level and options, it ranges from simple and utilitarian with hard plastic surfaces to nicely equipped with leather seats and a 6.5-inch touch-screen navigation and entertainment system. In base models you’ll have to pay extra for a driver’s seat that adjusts for height, and no Patriot model comes with a steering wheel that telescopes, making it more difficult to find a perfect driving position. The rear seats do fold nearly flat for extra cargo capacity, and in all but the base model also recline.
Exterior StylingFew will mistake the Patriot with its 4-door Wrangler Unlimited sibling, but at least the family resemblance is there. Like its beefier brother, the Patriot has a boxy shape, Jeep’s traditional front grille with seven vertical slots and signature round headlights. Standard roof rails add to the Patriot’s presence and practicality. For added toughness, skidplates and tow hooks come on models equipped with the Freedom Drive II off-road package.
Favorite FeaturesFREEDOM DRIVE I For those facing seasonal road conditions, Freedom Drive I provides a full-time 4-wheel-drive system designed to give year-round peace of mind. You won’t be tackling the Rubicon Trail with Freedom Drive I, but you could tow your ATV to where the trail starts.
FREEDOM DRIVE II OFF-ROAD PACKAGEFor those preferring the road less traveled – or no road at all – Jeep offers the optional Freedom Drive II Off-Road Package. It includes a 2nd-generation CVT transaxle with low range, 17-inch all-terrain tires and an abundance of skidplates, tow hooks and fog lights.
Standard FeaturesAs we’ve noted, the Patriot’s base price in Sport trim is tempting, but it buys only a budget vehicle in the strictest sense. You’ll have to crank your own windows, lock the doors manually and even forgo air conditioning. What you will get is a 5-speed manual transmission, cruise control and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with auxiliary input. A better bet is to step up to the Latitude model, which includes the basic creature comforts omitted in the Sport trim, plus heated front seats, power outlet and keyless entry. Top-line Limited models add leather-trimmed seats, automatic climate control, power driver’s seat, a larger engine and upgraded audio system.
Factory OptionsBoth Freedom Drive 4WD systems are available on all three grades of the Jeep Patriot, while other options vary by trim. If you want to spend the least but save your arms, you can get power windows and other creature comforts like air conditioning and Bluetooth phone connectivity on base Sport models. Latitude and Limited models can get infotainment and navigation systems with a 6.5-inch touch screen, while the top-line model can also be had with a Boston Acoustics premium sound system that has nine speakers – including two that flip down from the tailgate. Unlike competitors, the Patriot does not offer a rearview camera.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Jeep Patriot is available with a choice of two 4-cylinder engines and a trio of transmissions. Front-wheel-drive (FWD) versions of the Sport and Latitude models use the smaller 2.0-liter engine, while top-line Limited trims and all 4WD models use the larger 2.4-liter. The automatic transmission offerings are a 6-speed or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Four-wheel-drive models with the Freedom Drive II off-road system use the CVT that has a 19:1 crawl ratio for slowly navigating touchy off-road conditions. Owners needing to tow can opt for a prep package by Mopar that includes a Class II hitch to pull up to 2,000 pounds. The Patriot isn’t all that fuel-efficient – especially with the Freedom Drive II package – but at least it uses regular unleaded gasoline.

The formerly available cargo-area lamp that doubled as a removable flashlight has been replaced by a dome light.
The 2015 Patriot is the least expensive new SUV you can buy, and it’s a Jeep to boot. That’s the good news. Other aspects of this inexpensive 5-passenger Jeep are not so bright. It is aging, rather unrefined and not all that fuel-efficient compared to fresher crossover SUVs such as the Subaru Forester and Mazda CX-5.

If you want to enjoy the lower prices and cleaner emissions of natural gas, the Impala is now among the few vehicles factory-fitted to run on it.","ConsIf you prefer tire-smoking action over cushy road manners from your full-size sedan, the Chevy SS, Ford Taurus SHO or Dodge Charger can satisfy your appetite for adrenaline. On the other hand, if efficiency is top of mind, check out the Toyota Avalon Hybrid.",27700,"Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet ImpalaThe optional 3.6-liter V6 gives the Impala both praiseworthy fuel economy and the highest horsepower number of any naturally aspirated V6 in the segment. Its quicker-than-you’d-guess 0-to-60-mph time of 6.8 seconds is just one indication that the V6-powered Impala feels powerful in any situation. For 2015, only one 4-cylinder engine is available, a 2.5-liter that puts out an adequate 196 horsepower. It aims for fuel efficiency with start-stop technology that switches off the engine at idle, but its 31-mpg highway rating can’t match the 35 mpg of last year’s mild hybrid. Furthermore, you can’t disable the start-stop system and it may take some getting used to having the engine shut off at stoplights. No matter what engine you choose, the Impala offers luxurious comfort and quiet. The suspension employs MacPherson struts up front and a 4-link rear setup that translates to a highly comfortable and refined road-going experience.
Interior ComfortThe Chevy Impala may be considered a mainstream vehicle, but inside it feels more like a premium or even luxury sedan. Cabin materials are attractive and upscale. The large dash is notable for its flowing, well-executed design. Upper-trim models boast leather seats, soft trim and an 8-inch touch-screen command system in the center dash. Unlike some rivals, Chevy’s big sedan doesn’t feel the need to make all controls touch-oriented. Settings for climate, volume, fan speed and the like are easily changed with buttons and dials. We found the front seats comfortable and attractive. Rear-seat legroom is excellent.
Exterior StylingThe new Chevy Impala is nothing like the uninspiring former model. This big 4-door now has serious presence thanks to its long hood, sculpted front end and long, swept-back roof. In front are low-profile projector-beam headlights. Top-line LTZ models HID headlights and LED daytime running lights, taking a further step upscale. The overwhelming sense in the new Impala is one of contemporary luxury. That’s enhanced by an array of 18-, 19- and 20-inch wheels. Though the trunklid is exceptionally short, trunk space is not compromised: a substantial 18.8 cubic feet of cargo space (or 10 cubic feet for CNG models).
Favorite FeaturesSAFE TO SECURE VALUABLESBehind the Impala’s optional 8-inch color touch screen is an area similar to a hotel-room-style safe. When you use a 4-digit code to lock the safe, it locks the screen in the lowered position and locks out any private info entered into the Chevrolet MyLink system, including your address book.
NATURAL-GAS IMPALAThe 2015 CNG-capable Impala is one of just two factory-equipped sedans able to run on natural gas. And unlike the other – the Honda Civic – the Impala version is bi-fuel, meaning it can run on compressed natural gas or gasoline.
Standard FeaturesDepending on trim, the 2015 Impala will be a comfortable and competent 5-passenger sedan with generous room, or a luxury-like cruiser filled with advanced safety and entertainment systems. But even a base Chevrolet Impala comes with a power driver’s seat, cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity, and 60/40 split-folding rear seats. Standard audio is provided by a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with USB/auxiliary inputs and 4.2-inch color display. Stepping up trims levels gains features such as dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch color infotainment screen, Bluetooth audio streaming, a leather interior, push-button start, and heated front seats.
Factory OptionsA variety of options allow you to equip the Impala like a luxury sedan, as does stepping up trim levels. Notable options include navigation, a rearview camera, keyless entry, keyless start, a heated steering wheel, a power tilting/telescoping steering column, and heated and ventilated front seats. Bose surround-sound audio is available, and easy-to-use MyLink is standard on LT and LTZ models. The new 4G LTE feature with built-in Wi-Fi turns the Impala into a mobile hotspot. In addition to its standard 10 airbags and traction-control systems, the 2015 Impala offers adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and lane-departure alert.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available in the 2015 Chevy Impala family sedan, all transferring power to the front wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission. The base engine is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder. This powerplant aims to be the fuel-saver with its start-stop to turn off the engine at idle. The more robust offering is a 3.6-liter V6 that makes over 300 horsepower. New this year is a modified version of the V6 that runs on regular unleaded gasoline or compressed natural gas. The tank for the latter is in the trunk, cutting into cargo space. CNG range is expected to be 150 miles, after which the car switches to gasoline for an estimated total range of 500 miles. Drivers can also manually select fuel source.

The base 4-cylinder engine gets start-stop technology to save fuel, and 4G LTE with built-in Wi-Fi hotspot is now an option.
The Chevrolet Impala arrived in all-new form last year, wearing a sharp new suit and boasting an interior filled with technology and creature comforts. With the revamp, the Impala gained a new lease on life and again became a standout in the waning full-size sedan segment that includes the Dodge Charger, Ford Taurus, Chrysler 300 and Toyota Avalon. For 2015, the Chevy Impala continues to redefine the segment with helpful features and the availability of a bi-fuel model that can run on gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG). Like the generations of models that came before it, the 2015 Chevrolet Impala is notable for its plush ride manners, eye-catching design and generous space for passengers and cargo, but this latest version offers so much more.

If you’re looking for any or all of these attributes in a compact car, we suggest the Ford Focus, Dodge Dart or Hyundai Elantra. The Mazda3, Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf provide the convenience of a hatchback design.",17750,"Driving the Used 2015 Toyota CorollaDriving enthusiasts and die-hard car junkies probably won’t like the way the Corolla corners and accelerates. But, for the remaining 90 percent who simply want a comfortable, competent and credible car to get them to work on the weekdays and away on weekends, the 2015 Toyota Corolla sedan is more than up to the job. The ride is smooth and well mannered, and while we think the Ford Focus offers a quieter interior, road and wind noise levels inside the Corolla are certainly on par with most other compact sedans. Both iterations of the 1.8-liter engine deliver up enough power to safely merge or pass slower traffic, but they lack the ample torque found in many competitors. When equipped with the CVTi-S automatic transmission, the Corolla gets its best fuel economy and horsepower. The trade-off, however, is more engine noise under hard acceleration due to the high-revving engine.
Interior ComfortTelling the real story of Toyota’s newest Corolla sedan means talking about what’s inside. As we mentioned, this is a very nice interior – even the car’s headliner material is impressive. There’s plenty of stretch-out space in the front seats, and the long wheelbase gives rear-seat passengers world-record legroom. Rear headroom, however, is compromised by the jaunty sweep of the Corolla’s C-pillar/roofline into the trunk – good to look at, but requires ducking from tall-torsoed riders in back.
Exterior StylingThe Corolla sedan’s styling has allowed it to move away from an anonymity that the Federal Witness Protection Program can’t duplicate to an appealing series of folded edges in search of big wheels and tires to punctuate its stance (15-inch steel wheels are standard on base models, but find a way to move up to 16- or 17-inch wheels in steel or aluminum if you can). The car looks especially good in darker colors. And while the trunk capacity is a pinch bigger than the previous-generation Corolla, the trunk opening could be a tad bit bigger.
Favorite FeaturesAN INTERIOR HOME RUN, PART I: MATERIALSFor too long, Toyota let its compact car interiors look cheap and dated. The 2015 Corolla sedan suffers from neither problem, offering a handsome, comfortable and slightly sophisticated interior anyone would be proud to show off.
AN INTERIOR HOME RUN, PART II: TECH-READY SETUPOne of the biggest areas of improvement is in the Corolla’s highly sought after audio and infotainment systems. The 2015 Corolla includes USB and iPod interfaces, Bluetooth and an available Entune audio system with navigation and full apps suite.
Standard FeaturesLike most of the players in this class, the basic Toyota Corolla L comes pretty basic. The most notable exceptions – Nice interior! Cool, iPod connectivity. Ahh, Bluetooth hands-free calling. – have already been outlined. Don’t worry, the car gets air conditioning and a decent 4-speaker audio system, plus power windows, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and – all the rage in luxury cars these days – LED headlights. Always thinking of you, Toyota also includes a manual height adjuster for the driver’s seat. While not yet ready to tame all the forces in an offset crash test, the new Corolla does offer the protection of eight airbags.
Factory OptionsAs is the habit these days, carmakers don’t offer options so much as they offer option packages and add equipment by trim level. The 2015 Toyota Corolla sedan follows this lead. Pass on the base L version and step up to the LE models to get automatic climate control, Entune 6-speaker audio with streaming Bluetooth, bigger wheels, and remote keyless entry. Reaching up to the Corolla S rewards you with a sportier environment that includes fog lights, a chrome-tipped exhaust and a rear-deck spoiler, plus bolder seats and instrument cluster. The Driver’s Convenience Package (standard on Premium trims) nets you Entune Premium audio, navigation and apps as well as a power moonroof and push-button starting.
Engine & TransmissionWithout asking you to wade waist-deep into an engine-technology discussion, we’d like you to know that the 2015 Toyota Corolla is offered with two versions of a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine. The first version, used in L, LE and S Corolla models, produces 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque – not much bragging rights for power, but the fuel economy is strong for the class (see the EPA numbers below). The second 1.8-liter, in Corolla LE Eco models, gets to tout fuel economy as high as 42 mpg on the highway – superb for a non-hybrid – mated to Toyota’s CVTi-S continuously variable automatic transmission. That fuel-conscious CVTi-S also hosts the power in Corolla LE and S automatic-transmission models. A 6-speed manual gearbox is available in Corolla L and S versions, while a 4-speed automatic is available in the Corolla L.

LE and LE Eco models get a new painted front grille, while LE, S and LE Eco Premium trims become mono-spec cars, gaining last year’s Driver Convenience Package (moonroof, Smart Key and Entune), but offering no other packages or upgrades.
When Toyota overhauled the Corolla last year, the company used a mix bag of tricks, updating the exterior, interior and features, but retaining the same 1.8-liter engine and well-established twist-beam rear axle suspension. As a result, the 5-passenger 2015 Toyota Corolla sedan continues to offer buyers a solid, dependable compact car delivering good fuel economy at an affordable price. While the Corolla’s design is not revolutionary, Toyota knows it must remain competitive, so the Corolla offers up a number of refinements in audio and infotainment. It also offers more interior enhancements on par with with cars like the sporty Mazda Mazda3 and fuel-efficient Ford Focus.

Alpina, by the way, is a 3rd-party high-performance BMW tuner, working so closely with BMW that its cars are sold in BMW dealerships.
The 2015 BMW 6 Series slots between the 5 and 7 Series cars with a coupe, a convertible, and a 4-door that BMW calls a ""Gran Coupe,"" but we all know is really just a sleek sedan. Sleekness is all part of the game though, as the 6 Series is designed to offer eye-catching style over practical transportation. All three models offer plenty of style and performance, with engines ranging from a turbocharged 6-cylinder to a couple different V8 models. With roots that trace back to the late 1970s, the 3rd-generation 6 Series remains a leader in grand touring, even against such tough competitors as the Jaguar XK, Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe and Audi S5.
Used 2015 BMW 6 Series PricingBring money. While the base 2015 BMW 640i undercuts its competition, it’s still more than $76,000 to get into the driver’s seat. Want a V8 engine, you say? That’ll put you back more than $87,000. And that’s for the standard 2-door. If you want a Gran Coupe, add about $2,000, about $7,000 for the convertible. And if you want the all-weather stability of all-wheel drive, that’ll run an additional $3,000. The new Alpina B6 starts a little over $118,000. If you want more options, prices increase rapidly. Before buying, be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the BMW 6 Series. Long-term resale value is expected to be better than that of the Jaguar XK, near that of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class coupe, and lower than that of the Audi S5 and Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG.
Driving the Used 2015 BMW 6 SeriesThe 2015 BMW Alpina B6 xDrive Gran Coupe offers a unique experience in the BMW 6 Series range. With power close to what you get in the all-conquering M6 model, but with a bespoke interior treatment unavailable in any other model, the B6 offers tremendous performance and luxury in one package. It’s as if the B6 magnifies everything we already like about the BMW 6 Series: There’s the luxury, which – across the lineup from coupe to convertible to Gran Coupe sedan – means quiet and comfortable cruising suitable for mile after mile of open-road touring. Yet when the Driving Dynamics Control is in Sport+ mode, the 6 Series transmission kicks down eagerly and the suspension tightens, transforming this big car into a surprisingly nimble sporty car. Even the ""base"" 640i Coupe leaps to 60 mph in just over five seconds, and the M6 does it in just over four.
Interior ComfortWhile Audi may still have an edge with interior aesthetics, the BMW 6 Series isn’t far behind. More premium materials and interesting shapes are finding their way into new BMWs, and the latest-generation 6 Series may be one of the best examples yet. This goes double for the Alpina B6, with its bespoke cabin including unique leathers, Myrtle wood accents on the dash, and other premium touches. The two rear seats in the coupe and convertible are tight for adults, but acceptable for the Gran Coupe. The black fabric top on the convertible 6 Series models leaves cargo space largely unaffected when folded.
Exterior StylingCoupe, Gran Coupe or convertible, the 2015 BMW 6 Series boasts an athletic profile, one defined by a long hood and a striking crease that’s nearly the length of the body. The elegant and aggressive exterior looks confident, not cocky. The 6 Series Convertible is an elegant tourer with the top down, but lacks the visual balance of the Coupe, especially when the top’s raised. That said, the M6 performance models definitely lean more toward ""cocky,"" and are distinguished by wider 19-inch wheels, quad tailpipes and carbon-fiber composite roof panel. Alpina B6 models get unique wheels, and two unique colors.
Favorite FeaturesANY WAY YOU WANT ITWhile the BMW 6 Series is referred to as a family of coupes, the reality is that the Gran Coupe is actually a sleek 4-door sedan. That it means the goodness of the 6 Series is open to anybody who wants it, even if you can’t give up 4-door practicality.

A night-vision system can detect pedestrians via infrared camera. Individual options include things like 20-inch wheels and ceramic controls for the iDrive command-center module.
Engine & TransmissionFour powerplants are available for the 2015 BMW 6 Series, three of them variations of the same V8. Base 640i models use BMW’s much-loved 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 that makes a robust 315 horsepower. Move up to the 650i and you’ll get a 445-horsepower 4.4-liter turbo V8. The Alpina B6 uses a handbuilt version of that engine, tuned to 540 horsepower. Above that is the M6, also using a 4.4-liter turbo-8, but one tuned to a sizzling 560 horsepower. The 640i, 650i and Alpina B6 use an 8-speed automatic transmission, with either rear- or all-wheel drive. M6 variants use a 7-speed automatic or 6-speed manual and are rear-drive only. To save fuel – premium fuel – the 2015 BMW 6 Series uses auto start-stop to cut engine power at idle.

If you can swing a few thousand more for a higher trim, a V6 Journey with Chrysler’s Uconnect infotainment system is especially appealing.","ConsA 3-row Journey seats up to seven, but not as comfortably as something larger like a Chevy Traverse. And while a base Journey’s price is appealing, its 4-cylinder engine and 4-speed transmission are not. The Sorento features a fresher base powertrain, while it and the Mitsubishi Outlander have longer warranties.",21000,"Used 2015 Dodge Journey PricingThe 2015 Dodge Journey has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $21,000, including destination charge. Better-equipped mid-level versions of the Journey such as the SXT and Crossroad are in the mid-$20,000 range, while a top-line R/T version with options reaches the mid-$30,000 level. At its base price, the Dodge Journey AVP remains the lowest-priced midsize SUV, and even after climbing trims is a good value among midsize SUVs such as the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Mazda CX-9 and Kia Sorento. The Mitsubishi Outlander, which comes standard with seating for seven, is also a value leader among 3-row SUVs, but is smaller than the Journey. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Journey SUV. In the years ahead, the Journey’s residual value is expected to be average, still lagging the Toyota Highlander.
Driving the Used 2015 Dodge JourneyIf you’re moving up from an older, truck-based SUV, you’ll be pleased to know that modern crossover SUVs such as the Journey are more comfortable and refined on the road, much like a tall-riding station wagon. Essentially, that’s what the Journey is. Its suspension has the compliance to deal with all sorts of bumps and bad pavement, yet on mountain roads it has a level of firmness and control that keeps the Journey cornering securely with a minimum of bobbing and weaving. The standard, 173-horsepower 4-cylinder engine is only adequate to power the 2015 Journey. A far better option is the Pentastar V6, which has over 100 additional horsepower and nearly the same highway fuel economy. That bigger and better engine is also linked to a newer 6-speed automatic transmission. The Journey’s driver seating position is comfortable, and the standard push-button ignition is a nice touch – no more turning keys!
Interior ComfortThe Journey’s cabin is available in a 2-row, 5-passenger layout or as a 3-row, 7-passenger configuration. We’ve mentioned some of the appealing cargo-carrying functions of Dodge’s crossover SUV (see Favorite Features). Passenger space for adults is commendable up front and good in the second row, but legroom is very tight in the third row, which is best left for kids or occasional use. One of the best features of the Journey is its available Uconnect infotainment system. In addition to a large and easy-to-use 8.4-inch touch screen centered in the dash, there are supplementary buttons for climate and audio that are simple to see and use.
Exterior StylingIs it a sport-utility vehicle or the reincarnation of a station wagon? With the 2015 Dodge Journey, its 192.4-inch length exceeds much of the competition, but Dodge’s designers have given it exterior treatments such as the chrome-trimmed cross-hair grille and eye-catching aluminum-alloy wheel choices that keep it from being merely bland. If a more stylish look is important, opt for the R/T version, with its 19-inch wheels, monochromatic treatment and distinctive R/T labels. For a tougher-looking version, there’s the Dodge Journey Crossroad, which features a faux skidplate, standard roof rails and blacked-out wheels.
Favorite FeaturesCARGO FLEXIBILITY The Dodge Journey has special ways of holding and swallowing cargo. Yes, the rear seats flip and fold flat as in other SUVs, but unique to this crossover SUV is its available fold-flat front-passenger seat that accommodates larger items. Additionally, it has a hidden storage compartment under the seat cushion.
3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6 ENGINESmooth and responsive, the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine cranks out 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque and is its own best reason for choosing it for the Journey. It’s matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission that shifts smoothly and doesn’t “hunt” for gears in uneven terrain.
Standard FeaturesThe 2015 Dodge Journey is available in a half-dozen trims, from the base American Value Package (AVP) to the top-line R/T. At its most basic, the 2015 Journey includes dual-zone climate control, 4.3-inch touch-screen media center, keyless entry and push-button start, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power windows and door locks. Entertainment is provided by a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with auxiliary and USB inputs, but no Bluetooth streaming as standard. Safety features include electronic traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes, front-seat side airbags and side-curtain airbags for all rows.
Factory OptionsPlenty of options can be had on the 2015 Journey. Among the more popular are 3-row seating (Flexible Seating Group), traction-enhancing all-wheel drive in lieu of the standard front-drive setup, an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect infotainment system and navigation. Amenities that bring an upscale feel include leather seating, Infinity speakers, rear-seat video entertainment system with 9-inch screen and two wireless headphones, in-car Wi-Fi hot spot, and heated front seats and heated steering wheel. A Driver Convenience Group adds a rearview camera and distance-alert function when in reverse, but more advanced safety functions like blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking are not available.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are available for the 2015 Dodge Journey. Standard on lower trims is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that makes an only-adequate 173 horsepower. The engine we recommend is the 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 that is optional on all but base Dodge Journeys and standard in higher trims. The V6 is also your only choice if you require all-wheel drive (AWD) instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD) to deal with inclement weather and slippery roads. Both engines run on regular unleaded gasoline. All Dodge Journeys use automatic transmissions, with the 4-cylinder stuck with an older-style 4-speed and the 6-cylinder using a newer 6-speed. The Journey’s towing capacity is on the light end, limited to 1,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder and 2,500 with the V6.

Go with a Subaru Impreza.",18000,"Driving the Used 2015 Ford FocusThe 2015 Ford Focus follows in the footsteps of its predecessors. As a ""world car,"" with similar versions sold in multiple countries, the Focus is designed to appeal to just about everyone in the world, really. So it’s not surprising that the Focus delivers a first-class driving experience. All models combine a comfortable ride with confidence-inspiring driving dynamics. The top-level Titanium with its sport suspension rides a little firmer, but with even better handling. With front disc/rear drum brakes on the Focus S and 4-wheel discs on higher-trim levels, the brakes deliver sure stops. Even the Focus Electric can be considered fun to drive. If you’re looking for the ultimate Focus driving experience, the Focus ST is your ticket. With a 252-horsepower engine and sport-tuned suspension, it’s the sportiest Focus you can buy, and a blast.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Ford Focus comes with a host of interior upgrades to enhance usability. For example, there’s now a small cubby and USB port ahead of the shifter, perfect for your phone. The climate controls are easier to use, buttons on the new 3-spoke steering wheel are easier to use, and the door-lock switch has moved to the doors. With additional sound deadening, the 2015 Focus should also be quieter. The overall pros and cons remain. With expensive-feeling materials, the Focus boasts the look of a pricier, but it’s not the roomiest in its class.
Exterior StylingFor 2015, the Focus adopts an exterior design that’s much closer to the Fusion midsize sedan, with sedan models in particular resembling a smaller Fusion. Yet the parts we love about the Focus remain: The sleek aerodynamic look, raked windshield and tastefully flared fenders give the Focus a substantial look that belies its price. Both the sedan and hatchback can be outfitted with wheel and tire packages ranging from 15-inch steel wheels on the Focus S to 215/55 tires with 17-inch aluminum rims on Titanium models; Titanium models also offer an 18-inch wheel package with a sport-tuned suspension.
Favorite FeaturesHEAD-TURNING STYLEIt’s hard to find inexpensive cars brimming with style. Yet here we are, with a small car that resembles one of the best-looking midsize sedans available, the Ford Fusion. Like the Fusion, the 2015 Focus has styling elements, such as the grille, that pay homage to Aston Martin.
GREAT DRIVING EXPERIENCEJust because a car is entry-level doesn’t mean it has to be a drag to drive. Ford engineers understood this when putting together the Focus, and if you appreciate good road manners, this car might be the perfect fit.
Standard FeaturesAll 2015 Ford Focus models now get Ford’s MyKey as standard equipment, allowing owners to limit maximum speed and other settings for young drivers. This adds to an already generous standard-equipment list, which includes air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless remote entry and AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio, all of which come standard on base S models. SE models get standard SYNC with MyFord Driver Connect, cruise control, a folding rear seat, 4-wheel disc brakes, and 16-inch tires on alloy wheels. Titanium models add leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, push-button starting, and MyFord Touch; Focus Electric models get eco-fabric seat covers and voice-activated navigation.
Factory OptionsThe 2015 Ford Focus benefits from several new option packages. SE models can get a new Sport Package, which adds exterior styling enhancements, paddle shifters for the automatic transmission, revised suspension settings and 17-inch wheels. Also available are a blind-spot-warning system and lane-keeping system. Focus buyers can also order the new 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine for maximum fuel economy. Additionally, Ford’s SYNC AppLink is now available in the Focus, allowing Focus drivers to interact with more than 60 AppLink-enabled apps on their phones through the car’s SYNC technology. Active Park Assist, handling and winter packages, and navigation are also available.
Engine & TransmissionTo take fuel economy to a new level, the 2015 Ford Focus can be equipped with a turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine. Dressed in its most frugal form, the 3-cylinder Focus SFE is rated at 42 mpg in highway driving. Only a manual transmission is available with this engine, however. Most 2015 Ford Focus models use a 160-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic. On the SE with Sport Package and Titanium models, the automated-manual transmission adds SelectShift paddles on the new steering wheel. Focus Electric models get a 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motor and a range of about 75 miles. The 2015 Focus ST uses a 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine that makes 252 horsepower and is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. All Focus models are front-wheel drive.

The compact-car market is one of the most competitive, and it’s the details that make a car a winner. The 2015 Ford Focus hones in on those details with exterior styling that won’t look old in 12 months, while its modern interior boasts numerous usability upgrades across trim levels. The 2015 Ford Focus remains available as a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback, and has a variety of powertrains that span from an efficient 1.0-liter 3-cylinder to the ferocious 252-horsepower Focus ST, and even an all-electric variant in the Focus EV.

It also doesn’t have the same history in the segment as the stalwart best-selling Toyota Tacoma.",20995,"Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabThe good-looking 2015 Chevy Colorado was fun to drive, with plenty of power coming from both the 3.6-liter V6 and the 2.5-liter inline-4, both of which are available with a 6-speed automatic transmission. (A 6-speed manual comes standard with the inline-4.) We had to work the 4-cylinder Colorado harder than the V6, but with the smaller engine, the truck felt more spry and agile. The brakes were responsive and the ride was compliant, but not mushy. Space is tight in the second row of the Extended Cab model, and getting in and out is challenging, so we expect most people to choose the Crew Cab. The new Colorado offers a very quiet interior filled with creature comforts like an 8-inch touch screen, standard back-up camera, and the ability to make the Colorado a Wi-Fi hotspot. End result: The interior is part comfy crossover, part tough pickup.
Interior ComfortOne of the key aspects of the new Colorado that sets it apart from the competition is the truck’s interior. The Colorado is designed to be durable and capable of handling the rough treatment that often comes with using a truck on the job, yet the materials and features like MyLink, an 8-inch color touch screen and seat heaters align it more with the interior you would find in a small crossover SUV. It also has the quietest cabin in its class.
Exterior StylingThe new 2015 Colorado has key features that make it easy to load and unload cargo. Two of the most important are the standard CornerStep rear bumper, which provides a convenient way to get to gear that’s in the truck bed, and the available EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate, which allows you to lift the tailgate with one hand. The most off-road-capable Colorado, the Z71, has its own look, thanks to its 17-inch aluminum wheels and tires, and an off-road suspension package.
Favorite FeaturesGearOn BED CARGO DIVIDERThe GearOn system includes an available platform for the new Colorado that’s the length of the bed, which serves as a storage system. You can tie down bikes, work supplies or other gear on top and stow gear and tools underneath, out of view.
MYLINK CONNECTIVITYMyLink works with OnStar to give Colorado a safe way to stay connected. It’ll allow hands-free control of the stereo and phone calls, can read texts to you as you drive, and with OnStar’s 4G LTE, can make the Colorado a Wi-Fi hotspot.
Standard FeaturesEvery 2015 Chevy Colorado comes standard with a rearview camera and the CornerStep rear bumper. Other key standard features include a 4.2-inch screen for the 6-speaker stereo, cargo box lighting, power windows, and a locking tailgate. However, most people will buy the LT or Z71 trim levels as opposed to the Base and the Work Truck, and with those higher trim levels, things like three months of Sirius Satellite Radio, cruise control, OnStar, an 8-inch touch screen and navigation system, an overhead console, and a rear defroster are standard.
Factory OptionsThe new Colorado is available with a spray-on bedliner, fog lights, cross rails for the cargo box storage system and a locking rear differential. Many safety features come standard, but Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning are now available as well, for the first time in any compact/midsize truck. Other niceties include seat heaters for the driver and front passenger, and if someone wants something bigger than the standard 16-inch steel wheels, there are different styles of 17- or 18-inch aluminum wheels.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2015, the new Chevy Colorado is available with a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder or a 3.6-liter V6, and most of those will come with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Those who want a manual gearbox can get a 6-speed behind the 2.5-liter. Both of these engines are expected to have best-in-class fuel economy (in 2-wheel-drive models), and EPA estimates agree. For 2016, a third engine will be introduced: a 2.8-liter diesel powerplant. While it will likely cost more than the 3.6-liter V6, the diesel engine also promises to offer plentiful torque and should produce excellent fuel economy.

What's New?Changes are minimal as the 2015 Traverse soldiers on. The most significant updates are Siri Eyes Free iPhone integration, a revised wheel appearance, and new exterior and interior color choices.
As what’s dubbed a ""crossover SUV,"" the 2015 Chevrolet Traverse blends the roominess and high-riding outward visibility of a traditional SUV with the compliant road manners of a large sedan. Such vehicles have struck a chord with individuals and families who crave a vehicle with road presence, but who don’t need the off-road ability, heavy towing capability, or dent in their gasoline budget that usually accompanies big, truck-based SUVs. For others, the 7- or 8-passenger capacity of the Traverse is far more appealing than a minivan. Originally introduced in 2009, the Chevy Traverse still offers a lot of vehicle for the money, but is starting to show its age amid fresher 3-row competitors like the Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder and Kia Sorento.
Used 2015 Chevrolet Traverse PricingThe 2015 Chevrolet Traverse has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $31,695 for a base LS model. 1LT and 2LT models run $34,495 and $36,995, respectively, while the range-topping Traverse LTZ begins at $42,635. Adding all-wheel drive to any model is an additional $2,000. Fully decked-out, a 2015 Traverse can reach over $47,000. The 2015 Traverse’s starting price is slightly higher than competitors such as the Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Nissan Pathfinder, all of which are also smaller. Buyers seeking a bargain in this segment should check out the Kia Sorento (starting around $28,000) and Dodge Journey (just above $20,000 with 7-passenger seating). Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As for its resale value, we expect the Traverse to be average, in line with the Pathfinder but below the Highlander.
Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet TraverseEven in the face of newer competition, the 2015 Chevy Traverse remains one of our favorite crossover SUVs to drive and live with. In fact, it was among our 12 Best Family Cars of 2014. Its 280-plus horsepower V6 is smooth and strong, and easily gets Chevy’s big crossover SUV up to speed in both front-wheel-drive (FWD) and all-wheel-drive (AWD) form. The Traverse is larger than its competitors, and while it’s not agile like a Mazda CX-9, it doesn’t feel overwhelming on the highway. The view to the front and sides is commanding and the ride is comfortable. As with other 3-row SUVs, rear-side visibility is hindered by the last row of seats and small windows. When tested in a setting far from the Traverse’s comfort zone – a track – this big crossover-ute felt planted during hard cornering and braking, even on slick pavement.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Traverse has three rows of seats and can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Lower trims are built for eight with a bench seat in the second row, while upper trims can seat seven with a pair of roomy captain’s chairs in the second row. Base LS models make do with cloth seating and manual-adjust front seats, while top-line LTZ models have leather seats that are heated and cooled up front. One of the best traits about the Traverse is that it’s big enough for adults to sit in the third row and still boast enough room behind the seats for groceries.
Exterior StylingThe Traverse is over five years in its current design, but its style is holding up thanks to front and rear design tweaks a few years ago. Where others are blocky (Honda Pilot) and brawny (Ford Explorer), the 2015 Traverse retains its handsome, rounded (maybe too rounded at the rear) shape. LT models feature side mirrors with integrated blind-spot mirrors – helpful in a vehicle this size – while LTZ versions feature electronic blind-spot monitoring. LTZ models also stand out with dual exhaust outlets, body-color moldings and chrome accents. Lower trims have a manual liftgate, while higher ones feature a power-operated one.
Favorite FeaturesSMART SLIDE 2ND-ROW SEATGetting into a 3rd-row seat can be a hassle, especially for less-than-limber adults. This feature makes reaching that last row easier with a one-hand operation that creates easy access.
ADDITIONAL USB INPUTSHere’s a feature that’s largely forgotten about – right until you need it. When your kid’s tablet or MP3 player runs out of juice, the dual USB power inputs in back can make the difference between tears and cheers.
Standard FeaturesBeyond its sheer amount of vehicle for the money, the 2015 Chevy Traverse offers a good roster of standard features. A base LS model gives you keyless entry, a rearview backup camera, Bluetooth phone connectivity, AM/FM/CD/satellite audio with a 6.5-inch touch-screen display and front and rear USB ports. LT trims add a power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear park assist, and power liftgate (2LT trim). Top-line LTZ models bring leather, dual exhausts and a small bump in power, Bose premium audio, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, and blind-spot monitoring with forward collision monitoring.
Factory OptionsOptions vary across trims for the 2015 Traverse, but all models can be had with all-wheel drive for better traction instead of the standard front-wheel drive. Other available features are navigation with traffic data, blind-spot monitoring with a rear cross-traffic alert system (standard on LTZ), a power liftgate, 10-speaker Bose audio, rear-seat DVD system, and a dual-panel sunroof. Chevrolet’s MyLink Touch telematics system combines Bluetooth audio streaming, hands-free phone communication, voice recognition, and compatibility with apps such as Pandora. GM’s OnStar Directions and Connections service can be extended by subscription after six months of free coverage.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 Chevy Traverse uses a sophisticated 3.6-liter V6 with direct-injection and variable-valve-timing technology that helps it achieve a good balance of power and fuel economy. In LS and LT trims, the engine makes 281 horsepower. Top-line LTZ models have a dual-exhaust system that increases output to 288 horsepower. All models use a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission with a manual-shift mode. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel-drive optional for drivers who need enhanced traction. The Traverse is rated to tow a commendable 5,200 pounds, and all can run on regular unleaded fuel.

The 2015 Lexus IS offers polarizing style, and the 2015 Cadillac ATS is a surprisingly fun and less expensive alternative. Of course, there’s always the Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.",33500,"Driving the Used 2015 BMW 3 SeriesIt’s hard to talk about the 2015 BMW 3 Series without paraphrasing the Bavarian automaker’s famous tagline. These cars – from the base 320i to the all-conquering M3 – put a focus on driving pleasure, a trait that consistently puts them at or near the top of the segment in terms of ride and handling. The lone exception is the Gran Turismo hatchback, which isn’t as nimble as its smaller, lighter siblings. The 335i’s turbocharged 6-cylinder is good for 5.4-second 0-60 bursts, but the turbo-4 in the 328i is only about a half-second slower. The 320i gets to 60 mph in a still-quick 7.1 seconds. Even the diesel is no slouch, but it’s the 2015 M3, with its 0-60 mph time of less than four seconds, that holds top bragging rights. Most 3 Series models come with a fuel-saving stop/start feature. Unfortunately it shudders when the engine restarts – luckily, you can deactivate it.
Interior ComfortBMW says its 2015 3 Series interior is ""straight out of the BMW design handbook."" That translates to a straightforward look with tight fits, simple shapes and upscale materials. The center controls are angled toward the driver by seven degrees, putting them in easy reach. The spacious cabin offers more rear legroom than the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and Infiniti Q50. The driver and front passenger can use the console-mounted iDrive controller, and both can easily see the high-resolution central screen. The Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo models offer sizable cargo-hauling advantages over sedan-only rivals like the Lexus IS.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 BMW 3 Series’ link to its past is easily seen when you line the generations up side-by-side. Even casual observers know they’re looking at a BMW, and today’s slightly longer and taller 3 Series differentiates itself mostly by adding more defined character lines and creases, along with a visual connection between the headlights and the marque’s signature twin-kidney grilles. The hunchbacked Gran Turismo is an acquired taste, while the aggressively styled M3 hints at the beast that lies below its skin.
Favorite FeaturesBMW APPSAmong the apps iPhone users can use through the BMW Apps feature – apps like Glympse location sharing data, and audio books from Audible – BMW added a new feature: full integration with the GoPro camera app, including the ability to preview your video, and control the camera through iDrive.
SURROUND VIEW SYSTEMWe’re starting to think that a 360-degree camera-view around a car should be standard equipment on everything. The BMW 3 Series has one of the better systems, offering the birds-eye view plus a selectable Side View function, letting you monitor traffic crossing in front of the car.
Standard FeaturesBase 320i models come with leatherette (vinyl) upholstery, manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a 9-speaker sound system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, a USB port and Bluetooth music streaming, and HD Radio. For less money, the less-expensive Acura TSX and Audi A4 offer power front seats and leather as standard fare. Safety features standard on every 2015 BMW 3 Series model consist of eight airbags, active head restraints to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and shut down electrical systems after a collision.
Factory OptionsIn typical BMW fashion, the options list for the 2015 3 Series is both extensive and pricey, making it fairly easy to push even the entry-level 320i into the $45,000 range. However, some features are worth their weight in gold, including the Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, and navigation with programmable waypoints, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the available M Sport Package help bridge the performance gap between the standard 3 Series and the fire-breathing M3.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2015 BMW 3 Series lineup offers six different possible engines, and can be had with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (AWD). Three of the engines are 4-cylinders: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in 320i, a more powerful version in the 328i, and a 4-cylinder diesel. Then there’s the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 in 335i models, and the twin-turbo version in the M3. Finally, there’s the ActiveHybrid, with its 6-cylinder married to a 55-hp electric motor. Most can be ordered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed automatic. The M3 comes with the manual gearbox or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. The diesel models pack nearly the same low-end torque as the 6-cylinder, but with significant fuel economy benefits.

Read Full Review","What's New?The biggest news is the 2015 BMW M3, a 425-horsepower high-performance model that forgoes some luxury coddling in the name of going fast. The rest of the BMW 3 Series lineup gets a few minor tweaks, with standard Bluetooth audio streaming being the most noteworthy.
The BMW 3 Series has set the standard for entry-level luxury sport sedans for more than 30 years. Atop the heap it has remained, despite the efforts of age-old rivals like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4, and new challenges from the Lexus IS and Cadillac ATS. Part of the magic is the wide variety of configurations available. Last year, BMW unveiled the 320i model, which brings the 3 Series prestige to a more value oriented shopper. On the other end, this year hails the introduction of the 2015 BMW M3, the 5th-generation of the highest-performance 3 Series you can buy. Need more utility? There’s the 3 Series Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo hatchback. If fuel economy is your thing, there are also hybrid and diesel models available.

Efficiency isn’t lost on this German car, either, with 4-cylinder models attaining up to 34 mpg and a diesel good for 38 mpg.","ConsIf supple ride manners are more important than driving dynamics, try a Lexus or Mercedes. The latter also offers a diesel E-Class that earns up to 42 mpg. And while no one expects such a luxury car to be inexpensive, BMW’s pricing structure is vast and climbs quickly.",50000,"Used 2015 BMW 5 Series PricingThe 2015 BMW 5 Series has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $50,000 for a base 528i. Prices increase by several thousand dollars as you climb trims, with a 535i starting over $56,000 and a 550i debuting beyond $65,000. The sizzling M5 begins around $93,000. The 5 Series Gran Turismo variants start over $61,000. And keep in mind, these prices are before options. Competitors such as the Mercedes E-Class, Infiniti Q70, Jaguar XF and Lexus GS all share the 5 Series’ roughly $50,000 starting price, while the Audi A6, Cadillac CTS and new Acura TLX start several thousand dollars below. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. The BMW 5 Series’ resale value is expected to be in line with competitors like the E-Class, except for the ActiveHybrid 5 and Gran Turismo models, which have poor residual value.
Driving the Used 2015 BMW 5 SeriesWhether you choose a rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive (dubbed ""xDrive"") model, the 5 Series remains one of the best-driving, best-handling sedans money can buy. While Audi is better known for its Quattro all-wheel-drive system, BMW’s version offers peace of mind in cold-weather states where traction is compromised. No matter which 5 Series model you choose, power is abundant. Even the base 528i with its turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder has a 0-60 mph time of around six seconds, swift for a car this size and an engine that small. Still, the sweet spot in the 5 Series lineup is the 535i, with an inline-6 that deftly splits the performance/efficiency equation between 4- and 8-cylinder 5 Series models. Those seeking ultimate driving will find it in the M5, a beast of a sedan whose turbocharged 560-horsepower V8 obliterates asphalt while its luxurious interior coddles passengers. All 5 Series have a start/stop function that cuts the engine at idle. If you find it intrusive as we do, know it’s defeatable.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 5 Series’ 5-passenger cabin has familiar BMW design cues: a wide, driver-centric dash and controls, premium materials, and good room for occupants and their luggage. Controls for climate, audio and vehicle dynamics are generally easy to use. BMW’s large command dial to the right of the stubby gear selector requires a learning curve – we suggest putting the vehicle in park and practicing its functions before getting under way. The sedan’s 14-cubic-foot trunk offers good space, and standard 60/40 folding rear seats offer more flexibility. With its hatchback design and flat load floor, the 5 Series Gran Turismo offers even more cargo capacity.
Exterior StylingThe 5 Series sedan’s design announces the car’s athleticism without chasing fads. Up front is the requisite twin-kidney grille, the sides are crisply creased, and the rear features a nicely tapered trunk and contoured LED light strips. M5 models are identified by their quad exhaust outlets. All in all, the 5 Series sedan is anything but controversial. The same cannot be said about the larger 5 Series Gran Turismo, which appears bloated compared to its sleek sedan sibling. Despite its awkward rear, the tailgate sports a dual-access design that allows you to open a smaller trunklid or the entire hatch to load larger items.
Favorite FeaturesDIESEL ENGINEToday’s diesels are clean, quiet and sophisticated. In other words, nothing like they used to be. One of the latest applications is in the BMW 535d sedan, which offers tremendous power, high fuel economy, and is available in both rear-drive and all-wheel-drive form.
M SPORT PACKAGEDesigned for those who wish to squeeze every ounce of performance from their 5 Series sedan, the M Sport Package ups the ante with a sport suspension, lightweight 18-inch alloy wheels and a higher electronically limited top speed.
Standard FeaturesEven a base BMW 528i is well-equipped, as should be expected in a $50,000 sedan. Highlights include a standard navigation system, moonroof, bright xenon headlights, automatic climate control, a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD system with HD Radio reception, and 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with all-season run-flat tires. Surprisingly, leather is still an option on base models, which use leather-like upholstery. Go one trim higher with the 535i and you get the real thing. Also extra is a rearview camera, something becoming standard on cars from mainstream brands. New BMWs include Ultimate Service, which includes four years/50,000 miles of scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsProne to indecisiveness? Be warned: There is a long, long list of options for the 2015 BMW 5 Series, both in package and standalone form. As daunting – and expensive – as this may be, one nice aspect is that most features are available across the line. That means you don’t have to step up trims to have the 20-way climate-controlled front seats with massage function, hands-free trunk opener, full LED lights, Bang & Olufsen audiophile system, rear-seat entertainment screens, or a package that bundles features like lane-departure warning, active cruise control and a bird’s-eye-view camera system. And we haven’t even mentioned performance upgrades.
Engine & TransmissionNumerous powertrains are offered in the 2015 BMW 5 Series. As we’ve noted, even the base 4-cylinder is lively and efficient, delivering up to 34 mpg in the EPA’s highway cycle. The 5 Series’ mid-tier powerplant is BMW’s much-lauded turbocharged inline-6. The turbodiesel, also an inline-6, generates a monstrous 413 lb-ft of torque yet soundly beats the gasoline-electric ActiveHybrid 5 in fuel economy. In addition to not matching the diesel’s fuel economy, the pricier hybrid’s 26-mpg city/highway combined rating is only two better than a 535i and its highway rating is less. At the top is a 4.4-liter turbo V8 that motivates the 550i and M5 models. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is the standard format, but all-wheel drive (AWD) is available on most models. If you’re among the minority who crave a manual transmission, the M5 is where it’s at.

Ford counters that its 2.0-liter EcoBoost puts out just as much power. This is true, but some buyers prefer the smoother power delivery of a bigger engine. Diesel fans will also have to look elsewhere.",23000,"Driving the Used 2015 Ford FusionThe 2015 Ford Fusion backs up its looks with a dynamic driving experience, at least, for a family car. The base engine is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, and while it’s not quick, the suspension setup gives it surprisingly good handling for such a large family sedan. Both the 1.5-liter and 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinders provide more thrust, and you can still get a 6-speed manual transmission with the front-wheel-drive SE 1.6-liter, a rarity in this class. For the truly power hungry, the 240-hp 2.0-liter turbo will satisfy all but the most ardent V6 fans. On the other end of the spectrum, the Fusion Hybrid transitions between gasoline and electric operation nearly seamlessly, and can even go up to 62 mph on just electric power. The Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid can travel up to 21 miles at speeds up to 85 mph on just electricity, with a total range of up to 620 miles.
Interior ComfortThe 2015 Ford Fusion’s attractive 5-passenger cabin doesn’t feel as airy as some of its competitors. Nonetheless, there’s room for four adults, and three kids can sit in the rear without too much ""He’s on my side!"" The deep trunk can swallow more than a Honda Accord, although in hybrid and especially plug-in hybrid models, the storage area diminishes because of the battery pack. The family sedan’s rear seats fold for more cargo room, even in the Hybrid model, but they can’t be released from inside the trunk. Note that Ford uses recyclable or renewable materials for the seat fabric and foam on hybrid models.
Exterior StylingRemove the Ford badges off the 2015 Fusion, it could pass for an upscale European luxury sedan. Credit not just the grille, inspired by Aston Martin, but the subtle details Ford has strewn over the exterior. Take the aggressive headlights and thin taillights, for example, or the multiple unique wheel designs and interesting color palette. On a practical note, the clever EasyFuel capless gas filler system means you’ll never again lose your fuel cap, or have to wrestle it open or closed. Fusion Energi models use a lighted ring around the charge port, with a fully lit ring meaning charging’s complete.
Favorite FeaturesPLUG-IN HYBRID VERSIONThe 2015 Ford Fusion Energi can go up to 21 miles on a charge, meaning many people could go for weeks without refueling. But with a gasoline engine backing it up, room for five, and a total range of 620 miles, it’s also good for road trips.
SMALL BUT EFFICIENT ENGINESEvery 2015 Ford Fusion model uses a fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engine, including the hybrid sedans. That means that under the hood of the Fusion, there’s an efficiency-to-horsepower ratio for just about anybody.
Standard FeaturesEven the base 2015 Ford Fusion S model comes nicely equipped. Standard features include manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary input, 16-inch wheels, and Ford’s SYNC wireless communication system with voice control. Move up to the SE models and you’ll get a 10-way power driver’s seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system, and 17-inch wheels. The top-line Titanium model nets the powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, 12-speaker Sony premium audio system with HD and satellite radio, dual-zone auto climate control, a rearview camera, leather seating, and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsIn addition to more powerful engines, and things like leather seats and upgraded audio systems, there’s an emphasis on high-tech safety in the 2015 Ford Fusion. Blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance, and adaptive cruise control with collision warning are all available to expand driver awareness. Then there’s the reverse-sensing system and Active Park Assist which help with parallel parking. SE and Titanium models can also be equipped with all-wheel drive, giving the Fusion a leg up against many of its family sedan competitors when it comes to tackling foul weather in snowbelt states.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2015 Ford Fusion is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, but we suggest moving up to the SE sedan, where you have your choice of the 1.5-liter, 1.6-liter or 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, all of which can run on regular gasoline. The 1.6-liter engine offers a 6-speed manual transmission, while the others employ a 6-speed automatic. The 1.5-liter offers start/stop technology that shuts off the engine at a stop to save fuel. The Fusion Hybrid and Energi plug-in hybrid use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor – along with a continuously variable automatic transmission – to achieve excellent fuel economy. The Energi can travel up to 21 miles in electric mode, with up to 620 miles total range. Recharge time is projected at seven hours on a 120-volt outlet, or 2.5 hours on a 240-volt outlet.

There’s something for every midsize 4-door sedan shopper in the 2015 Ford Fusion lineup. Buyers can choose from three turbocharged gasoline powerplants, ranging in size from 1.5 to 2.0 liters, with all-wheel drive available on SE and Titanium models. Need a hybrid? The Fusion offers one that gets an EPA-rated 47 mpg in the city. If you need even more electrification, the Fusion Energi is a plug-in hybrid sedan that can go 21 miles on batteries alone. Through it all, every Fusion model offers up striking styling that’s uncommon to the family sedan market. The Fusion can be packed with technology, like the available MyFord Touch infotainment system. Throw in a surprisingly sporty driving dynamic, and you have a car that can please both the practical and performance-minded.

If you need to haul more stuff, check out something like the Honda CR-V. If you need more passenger space, but don’t want a bulky vehicle, a Kia Sorento could be a good choice.",25000,"Driving the Used 2015 Chevrolet EquinoxIf you’re a fan of a quiet and comfortable highway ride, then you’re going to love the Chevy Equinox. The relative quiet gives this Chevy the feel of a more expensive vehicle, and that’s just fine with us. However, otherwise the Equinox is pretty straightforward on the road. The more powerful engine doesn’t exactly slingshot this SUV, and even the 2.0-liter turbo 4-cylinder in the Ford Escape feels quicker. Blame weight: The V6 Equinox weighs nearly two tons, and the 4-cylinder models aren’t much lighter, but at least they improve on fuel economy. Still, despite competitors like the Mazda CX-5, which enjoys a twisty back road now and then, the compact SUV market isn’t exactly a hotbed of driving excitement anyhow. Instead, you’ll likely enjoy the ride, features and roomy back seat over long hauls.
Interior ComfortDespite being comfortable and versatile, the Equinox doesn’t make the best use of its exterior bulk inside. For example, even though the Honda CR-V is nearly 10 inches shorter, it boasts roughly six more cubic feet of storage behind the rear seat. The flip side of that is passenger seating, and here the Chevy Equinox shines. With well-bolstered seats, front and back and lots of legroom for all passengers, it’s easy to get comfortable, even with a full load of people. The high-quality interior is attractive overall, but marred by too many buttons and small dials.
Exterior StylingThe 2015 Equinox is surprisingly big. In fact, at more than 187 inches, it’s actually longer than a Ford Edge or the 3-row Kia Sorento, both of which fall into the midsize-SUV category. However, the soft curves of the sheet metal balance the overall boxy shape, making the Equinox look a little smaller than it is. Higher-end models feature body-colored mirrors and roof rails. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, with 18-inch and 19-inch versions available.
Favorite FeaturesADJUSTABLE POWER LIFTGATEPower liftgates are nothing new. However, they can be a mixed blessing, as it’s all too easy to accidentally hit whatever’s above the door, possibly damaging it. The optional power liftgate on 2LT models and standard in the top-line LTZ trim has an adjustable height setting to avoid overhead collisions.
REAR-SEAT LEGROOMIf the 2015 Chevy Equinox has an ace up its sleeve, it’s rear-seat room. With 39.9 inches of legroom, and a back seat that slides, the Equinox has plenty of space for passengers to stretch out. Not to mention, it makes installing a child seat that much easier.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2015 Chevrolet Equinox LS comes with a 6-speed automatic transmission, cruise control, a trial of GM’s OnStar service that includes 4G connectivity and Wi-Fi, and safety features like traction control, electronic stability control, and multiple airbags, including those for rear outboard passengers. If you move up to the mid-level LT model – a better bet in our opinion – you get a standard rearview camera, heated outside mirrors, a roof-mounted luggage rack, and overall nice trim. The top-level LTZ gets leather seats, a power front passenger seat, a power tailgate, lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert.
Factory OptionsAll-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Equinox models, including the base LS, but if you want V6 power you’ll have to move up to the LT or LTZ models. The LS is pretty stripped down, and stays that way. But the LT has plenty of options to keep you busy, including a lot of things that are available on the LTZ like lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert. You can also get navigation, an upscale Pioneer audio system, and a sunroof. A rear-seat entertainment package with DVD player with dual screens and two wireless headphones can keep kids occupied.
Engine & TransmissionStandard issue on the 2015 Chevy Equinox is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 182 horsepower. ""Adequate"" is probably the best way to describe its ability to haul the 3,700-pound SUV. If you’re looking at an LT or LTZ, a 3.6-liter V6 with 301 horsepower is available, and it does a better job hauling the Equinox, but it’s still not a speed demon. Either engine comes with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and both run on regular gasoline. If you need to tow, the V6 is the better choice thanks to its 3,500-pound capacity. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard with either engine, with all-wheel drive an option for those who want a little extra peace of mind on slippery roads.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2015 Chevy Equinox is virtually identical to last year’s model. The only notable change is 4G connectivity through OnStar, plus the ability to share that connection with other devices through onboard Wi-Fi.
Technically, the 2015 Chevrolet Equinox competes against compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, and Ford Escape. Like those, it seats five, and thanks to its considerably bigger dimensions, it offers up a roomy back seat. The compromise is with cargo space, where the Equinox falls short of even its smaller compact competitors. Behind the wheel, the Equinox isn’t particularly exciting, but it does offer up a comfortable and quiet ride. It’s also one of the only compact crossover SUVs to offer a V6 engine, a 301-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 that lets the Equinox tow up to 3,500 pounds. Fuel-conscious buyers will be more interested in the 4-cylinder version, which claims a competitive 32 mpg.

Although the Drive-E T5 offers the same 240 horsepower as the previous 3.2-liter inline-6, the XC60 is notably quicker, accelerating from a standstill to 60 mph in just under 7 seconds, rather than the 9-second time of the previous vehicle. It’s even better with the turbocharged and supercharged Drive-E T6, which gets to 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds. A downside is that the Drive-E T6 also suffers from torque steer at full throttle, and the squirming steering wheel is nobody’s idea of fun. Still, there’s a lot to like from behind the wheel of the XC60. If you opt for an AWD model, we strongly suggest skipping the 3.2-liter engine and springing for the turbocharged T6; you’ll thank us every time you pass someone on the freeway.
Interior ComfortAs befitting a Swedish automobile, the XC60’s interior is sleek and understated. A new dash layout includes an available TFT adaptable digital instrument cluster that allows the driver to select different settings and colors. Still onboard is Volvo’s clever ventilation control in the shape of a person sitting down. To direct air to your upper body, just hit the figure’s ""head""; touch the legs, and air moves to the foot-wells. Contrasting colors adorn seats and door panels, and the bucket-style front seats are very comfortable. On the downside, the manual lumbar controls are awkwardly placed and hard to operate.
Exterior StylingToday’s Volvos look nothing like the blocky models of the past. Bucking the squared edges and boxy greenhouses of other SUVs, the XC60 has a wonderfully graceful profile. Lovely in form, the 2015 Volvo XC60 is still functional. The vehicle’s roof rails are low to reduce wind noise, and an optional crossbar system can be attached to carry bikes, kayaks, skis and more. R-Design models have stylish 20-inch wheels that lessen the XC60’s off-road abilities in favor of more pavement performance. If you regularly churn through snow or mud, we recommend the base models.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVE-EThe Drive-E engines in the 2015 Volvo XC60 are the real deal. Fuel economy jumps from 18 mpg in the city to 24 mpg, and the XC60 is more than 2 seconds quicker to 60 mph, too. And that’s for the T5; the T6 is even quicker, and still gets better economy.
CITY SAFEThis system provides a technological safety net for distracted drivers. At speeds of 19 mph or below, the system senses stopped or slow-moving objects ahead – other cars or pedestrians – and automatically applies the brakes if the driver does not, avoiding or reducing the severity of accidents.
Standard FeaturesBase FWD 2015 Volvo XC60 T5 models come with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, an 8-speed Aisin automatic transmission, skidplates on the front and rear, the City Safety system, a 5-year/50,000-mile warranty, complimentary factory scheduled maintenance for five years, and five years of roadside assistance. Also standard are steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, power windows, Bluetooth hands-free phone interface with audio streaming, 18-inch wheels, a 160-watt, 8-speaker sound system with CD/DVD player and HD Radio, and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel. FWD is standard. AWD models receive either the old 3.2-liter 6-cylinder or the turbocharged 3.0-liter 6-cylinder, both connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Factory OptionsThe Tech Package bundles a series of safety technologies, including Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning, Collision Warning, Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection and the new Road Sign Information, which ""sees"" important road signs approaching and displays them on the driver information screen. Other available additions to the XC60 include in-dash navigation, dual-screen rear-entertainment system, 12-speaker premium sound system, integrated rear child safety seats, panoramic roof with power sunshade, and a walnut steering wheel. The Climate Package adds heated front and rear seats, heated windshield and a heated steering wheel. Options also include active HID headlights with heated washers and a Sport Package.
Engine & TransmissionThe big news for the 2015 Volvo XC60 is the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder Drive-E engine family. Front-wheel-drive models get the 240-hp turbocharged T5, or starting in May 2014, the 302-hp turbo- and supercharged T6; both come with an 8-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive models still use the modest 3.2-liter inline-6, or the more powerful turbocharged 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine that puts out 300 horsepower. R-Design models give a further boost to the turbo engine, raising output to 325 horsepower. AWD XC60 models are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission and can run on regular unleaded gasoline. Towing capacity for all models is limited to 3,300 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?After a major restyling last year, the 2015 Volvo XC60 is almost entirely carryover, with the exception of the new Drive-E engine family. Available on FWD models, the engine comes in two flavors: a 240-horsepower turbocharged version, or a 302-hp turbocharged and supercharged model.
The 2015 Volvo XC60 is in a tough competitive field. It has to deliver luxury like the Lexus RX, offer the power of the agile BMW X3 and Audi Q5, but be priced like the Acura RDX. Somehow, this Volvo delivers, and then the XC60 tosses in a big dose of styling, safety and individualism. This year, Volvo is introducing its all-new engine lineup to the XC60. Known as Drive-E, these engines will eventually replace the 5- and 6-cylinder engines in Volvo models across the board, offering the same or better performance, but with better fuel economy. Throw in the XC60’s perfect 5-star crash-test ratings, an achievement no other SUV in this class can match, and the XC60 trumps any of its competitors for buyers who have children.

Other notable features include Lane Departure Warning Plus, Advanced Brake Assist and Full Speed Forward Collision Warning Plus, all of which are optional.
In the midsize sedan segment lurk industry-leading stalwarts like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima, but the 2015 Chrysler 200 is no longer a 2nd-class citizen. In fact, it’s not even remotely mistakable for the 1st-generation 200 model it’s replacing. Gone are the days where you can get a 200 convertible, but it was the last (and only) holdout from the midsize segment to let go. The front-wheel-drive 200 offers a choice of two engines – a 4-cylinder for fuel-economy and a V6 for fun. The new 9-speed automatic transmission contributes to a smooth ride and respectable fuel figures as well. All-wheel drive is available on 200S and 200C models.
Used 2015 Chrysler 200 PricingFor a base 2015 Chrysler 200 LX, you’re looking at spending around $22,700, which includes a $995 destination fee. On the other end of the spectrum, a fully-loaded 200C can set you back $34,675, but this includes optional all-wheel drive and both the optional Customer Preferred Package 26N ($1,295) and Navigation and Sound Group 1 ($1,395). When looking at the competition, the 2015 200’s starting price is within a couple hundred dollars of the Honda Accord sedan and Toyota Camry. Check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to get a better idea of what folks in your area are paying for their 2015 Chrysler 200s.
Driving the Used 2015 Chrysler 200The 200C in front-wheel-drive configuration with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine feels a little underwhelming, with power taking its time to show up. This is quickly rectified by going with the 3.6-liter V6. Acceleration is plentiful and the 200 sedan has no trouble getting on the highway. The 9-speed automatic transmission works harmoniously with both engines and even features a Sport mode. On the open highway, road and engine noise are kept to a minimum, due in part to acoustic treatment of the wheel wells and the optional availability of an acoustic windshield and front windows. A new carpet lining the floor also helps keep external noise down.
Interior ComfortAs we just touched on above, the Chrysler 200’s new interior is now one of the nicest in the midsize-sedan class thanks to an all-out redesign. Available power-adjustable seats and leather-trimmed seats set the pace for a comfortable cabin. Interior accents like real wood with an exposed edge stretching across the dashboard give the new 200 a refined feel on the inside.
Exterior StylingBoasting a coupe-like profile, the 200 sedan’s sleek lines guide your eyes from the front to the back of the 4-door. Up front, the new Chrysler badge appears to be floating in the grille and is bookended by projector-beam headlights. Aiming for a ""timeless, exciting"" look, the company is using this fresh design as a template for the face of future Chrysler products.
Favorite FeaturesALL-WHEEL DRIVEA space once reserved for the Subaru Legacy, the 2015 Chrysler 200 now joins the Subaru as the only other vehicle in the segment to offer all-wheel drive.
INTERIORStarting with a clean slate, Chrysler 200 designers were able to redo the interior completely. Chrysler wanted to use furniture-grade materials in the new sedan, which can be seen in features like the real wood with an exposed edge on the dashboard.
Standard FeaturesMultistage airbags, Uconnect infotainment with a USB port, keyless entry and start (no need to ever take the key out of your pocket or purse), stability and traction control, antilock brakes, Brake Assist, an electronic parking brake, and cruise control are just a few notable standard features.
Factory OptionsCustomer Preferred Package 26N will set you back $1,295 on the Chrysler 200, but brings features like Advanced Brake Assist, rain-sensing windshield wipers, Full Speed Forward Collision Warning Plus, Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go, Blind Spot Monitoring, and Park Assist along with it. The other optional package we recommend springing for is Navigation and Sound Group 1 ($1,395). This includes features like navigation, HD radio, and an 8.4-inch Uconnect touch screen.
Engine & TransmissionIf it’s fuel efficiency you’re after in your 200 sedan, then we recommend going with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine – while it’s a little short on power, it makes up for that in mpgs. The 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine, on the other hand, serves up power much quicker, but fuel economy does suffer a tad. No matter which engine you decide to go with though, a new 9-speed automatic transmission rows through the gears allowing for highway fuel economy to stretch out.

Volkswagen’s 2015 Beetle grants access to one of the world’s most iconic vehicles at a low entry price. Of course, today’s Beetle is a far cry from the VW Bug of decades ago, and is markedly changed from the New Beetle that helped usher in the new millennium. Now simply called the Beetle, this generation of VW’s venerable nameplate was introduced for the 2012 model year with beefier looks, bigger proportions and a sleek 4-passenger interior that takes cues from its Audi cousins. But its Beetle essence remains with its rounded shape and retro vibe. The Beetle is larger than niche rivals such as the Fiat 500 and Mini Cooper, is available as a coupe or convertible, and offers a variety of powertrains including a diesel engine.
Used 2015 Volkswagen Beetle PricingThe 2015 VW Beetle has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $21,000 for the Classic edition coupe, and it offers impressive content, including an automatic transmission. The base Beetle 1.8T still offers much in the mid-$22,000 range, also with an automatic transmission. The TDI diesel starts in the mid-$25,000 range, and the top-line R-Line model begins just over $26,000. Convertible models begin just over $26,000. A loaded Beetle R-Line hardtop can reach the low $30,000s, while a loaded convertible can run into the mid-$30,000 range. At these prices, the 2015 Beetle is in line with the 2015 Mini Cooper Hardtop and a few thousand higher than the starting points for the Fiat 500. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Beetle. The VW Beetle’s resale value is not expected to hold up well, and not nearly match that of the Mini Cooper.
Driving the Used 2015 Volkswagen BeetleWith a choice of three engines, the 2015 VW Beetle can feel like as many different cars depending what’s under the hood. Base models paired with the 1.8-liter turbocharged gasoline engine that has replaced the previous 5-cylinder is a welcome change that offers zippier performance and better fuel economy. The new diesel engine offers excellent fuel economy and surprising power, especially in off-the-line acceleration. The sportiest of Beetles is the R-Line, which packs a 210-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder. The R-Line also includes a sport suspension for better handling, though don’t expect it to perform like a Golf GTI. The Beetle in general has a softer ride that’s well-suited for its intended audience. Unlike smaller 4-seat coupes and convertibles such as the Fiat 500 and, to some extent the Mini Cooper, the 2015 Beetle feels stable even at freeway speeds.
Interior ComfortWhether coupe or convertible, all 2015 VW Beetles have four seats. The front seats are spacious but the rear seats are tight. The Beetle’s interior is clean and simple with easy-to-use controls. A center armrest makes long commutes more comfortable. Multiple storage bins in the center console are ready for cell phones and other small items. And there’s the ""kaeferfach"" – an upper, secondary glove box that’s a throwback to Bugs of yore. Coupe models have a hatchback design and surprising cargo space – 15.4 cubic feet with rear seats upright. Convertibles have less than half that space, and trunk access is rather awkward.
Exterior StylingLess Flower. More Power. Today’s Beetle is bigger, beefier and sportier-looking than the New Beetle that came before it with a built-in vase. The 2015 Volkswagen Beetle is still instantly recognizable, but its iconic shape has been elongated and now looks more like its sexy cousin the Audi TT. A rear spoiler that’s standard on the R-Line and optional on other models injects sporty appeal and a visual break from the rest of the Beetle’s mounds of round. Convertible Beetle models have a power-operated folding fabric top and a trunk lid instead of the hardtop’s liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesMANUAL TRANSMISSIONSIf you’re into manual transmissions, rejoice at their availability in the 2015 Beetle. Incredibly, even a diesel convertible offers one.

Standard FeaturesNew to the 2015 VW Beetle lineup is the Classic edition. It’s the least expensive model but offers surprising value. Included is an automatic transmission, 5-inch touch-screen navigation system, heated front seats, Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, Volkswagen’s Car-Net telematics system, cruise control and tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Audio entertainment is provided by an 8-speaker AM/FM/CD/satellite radio system with iPod and auxiliary connections. TDI models add a premium audio system with 6-disc changer and HD Radio, and keyless access and push-button start. R-Line models have the most powerful engine and 18-inch alloy wheels. All new VWs come with one year/10,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.
Factory OptionsOptions on the 2015 Beetle, with some dependent on trim, include navigation system, panoramic sunroof, keyless access, 18-inch alloy wheels, and premium Fender audio system. R-Line models can be had with bi-xenon headlights, leather interior and upgraded 19-inch wheels. Accessories to personalize the Beetle include a rear spoiler, body styling kit, and nickname badges on the rear, i.e., to call your new Beetle a ""Bug.""
Engine & TransmissionWith the old 5-cylinder gone, all three 4-cylinder engines available in the 2015 Beetle are easy to recommend. The base powerplant is a 1.8-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. With 170 horsepower and up to 33 mpg, it offers a good balance of pep and efficiency. The new diesel engine in the Beetle TDI earns up to 41 mpg and provides a stout 236 lb-ft of torque. The zippiest Beetle is the R-Line with its 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine that makes 210 horsepower. All Beetles are front-wheel drive. As mentioned in Favorite Features, manual transmissions are widely available across the Beetle lineup, but the 6-speed automatic DSG is just as recommendable. The turbo gasoline engine in 1.8-liter models can run on regular unleaded; premium is recommended in the R-Line.

ConsBest-in-class V6 fuel economy combined with an exceptionally versatile air suspension system make the Ram 1500 an intriguing option for those who place a premium on practicality. GM buffs looking for a slightly more upscale alternative should explore the equally-new 2014 GMC Sierra.",35000,"Driving the Used 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew CabGM engineers put a great deal of effort into developing a remarkably quiet cabin for the 2014 Chevy Silverado, and the hard work paid off. Road and wind noise are nicely quelled at highway speeds, while the retuned suspension soaks up everything short of a sinkhole. Steering is light and precise, with responsiveness that belies the Silverado’s portly dimensions. Acceleration from the standard V6 is adequate for “air haulers” and light-duty users, though loads weighing in excess of 5,000 pounds are best left to the mid-tier 5.3-liter V8. The standard 6-speed automatic does an admirable job of keeping power on tap, especially with the well-calibrated tow/haul mode engaged. Lastly, while the pedal feels a bit spongy, the brakes themselves provide more than enough pucker power.
Interior ComfortEven without the High Country’s perforated leather and extensive comfort/convenience touches, the 2014 Chevy Silverado offers one of the finest interiors in the segment. Soft-touch surfaces are scarce in lower trims, but most plastics are well-textured, lending impressive substance to the cabin. Basic push-button controls handle most primary functions, and the ergonomic center stack keeps the touch-screen within arm’s reach. Clever storage solutions scattered throughout the interior demonstrate thoughtful attention to detail. Call us old fashioned, but we actually prefer the superior flexibility provided by the standard front bench seat over the optional bucket seats.
Exterior StylingThe more things change, the more they stay the same. While this isn’t the official design philosophy behind the 2014 Silverado, it does put the new look into perspective. As a whole, the truck is instantly recognizable as a Silverado, yet subtle styling tweaks all around the exterior combine to impart a sense of modernity. On the practical side, LT trims and higher feature a new damped tailgate that smoothly lowers itself without assistance and requires minimal effort to close. Double cab models (formerly dubbed extended cab) ditch the old reverse-opening half-doors in favor of fixed B-pillars and forward-hinged doors for increased structural rigidity and safety.
Favorite FeaturesMYLINK INFOTAINMENTWhether you’re a smartphone aficionado or a rebellious technology holdout, Chevy’s 2nd –generation MyLink system is quite possibly the most rewarding infotainment system money can buy. Features like mobile application support, real-time data widgets and one-shot destination entry (speak an entire address at once) deliver connectivity without complexity.
CORNERSTEP BUMPERAs author William Golding once said, “The greatest ideas are the simplest.” This wisdom holds true in the automotive world, and the Silverado’s new Cornerstep bumper is a prime example. The feature allows for easy access to the cargo bed by way of footholds integrated into the rear bumper.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Silverado is offered in standard cab, double cab and crew cab body styles. Double cab models come with a 6’6” bed, while regular cabs offer the choice of a 6’6” or 8’ bed. Crew cabs are available with a 5’8” or 6’6” bed. In terms of equipment, the volume-leading LT grade includes an “EZ-Lift” tailgate, a driver information center with a 4.2-inch display, OnStar emergency/concierge services, and a 6-speaker audio system with Pandora and basic voice-recognition software. Stepping up to the LTZ trim lands you heated front seats, leather and touch-screen audio, while the upper-crust High Country edition adds ventilated front seats, Bose premium audio, and 20-inch chrome wheels in a Western-themed package. Z71 versions up the performance ante with a locking rear differential, off-road suspension and all-terrain tires.
Factory OptionsOptions lists for today’s full-size trucks have a tendency to read like “War and Peace”. To help remedy this age-old dilemma, Chevrolet product planners reduced the number of configurations for the 2014 Silverado. A la carte features we feel are worth the additional coin include LED cargo bed lighting, MyLink navigation, moveable upper tie-down hooks and a factory-installed spray-on bed liner. The LT Convenience Package delivers a good balance between necessity and price, offering a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a 10-way power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, and a backup camera, all for around $1,500.
Engine & TransmissionWhile their displacements carry over unchanged, all three engines available in the 2014 Silverado are entirely new from the block up. Each Ecotech3 engine incorporates direct fuel-injection, an all-aluminum design, and cylinder deactivation technology that seamlessly shuts down half of the engine’s cylinders under light loads. A 6-speed automatic transmission linked to a manual shift mode is standard across the board. Due to low customer take rates and negligible performance gains, the Silverado’s 2-mode hybrid powertrain is no more.

Though its familiar sheet metal does very little to suggest otherwise, the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado is all-new from head to toe. It’s what lies beneath the bodywork that counts, as the Silverado’s improvements become immediately evident once you step inside. The revamped cabin is perhaps the quietest in the segment, and the use of higher-quality materials helps to spice things up considerably. A trio of new engines combined with significant chassis and suspension upgrades put the new Silverado on competitive footing with the recently redesigned Ram 1500, the forthcoming 2014 Toyota Tundra, and Ford’s top-selling F-150. Fuel economy numbers are nothing to get excited about, but the 2014 Chevy Silverado delivers big on its promise of blending work-truck capability with everyday civility.

Rear-seat room is woeful, and rearward visibility is even worse. Regarding those latter aspects, the larger Dodge Challenger is more livable.",24450,"Driving the Used 2014 Chevrolet CamaroNo Camaro is slow. With over 320 horsepower, even the basest of Camaro models has enough power to produce grin-inducing straight-line blasts. Then there’s the ZL1 with a supercharged V8 that manifests 580 horsepower and boasts a 0-60 mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s supercar-quick, and thanks to its built-in launch control, that model can accelerate thus so even by novices. Our vote for the most well-rounded Camaro is the 426-horsepower SS model with the 6-speed manual (our gearbox of choice, as automatic transmissions feature an Active Fuel Management system that reduces horsepower count by 26). With a girth of power channeled to the rear wheels, it’s easy to point and shoot the Camaro. But attempting to toss nearly two tons of American muscle around a track is more about finesse than fun. Severely limited rear visibility remains a big tradeoff for the Camaro’s aggressive exterior design.
Interior ComfortStanding in sharp contrast to the Camaro’s excellent exterior design is its lackluster interior. Expectations are quickly deflated at the sight and feel of hard plastics on the doors and center console. The available cluster of four gauges for oil pressure, battery voltage, and oil and transmission temperature help to bring retro charm to the cockpit. The Camaro’s low-slung roof robs headspace for taller drivers, the small sun visors are nearly useless, and the back seats can feel like purgatory for adults. The Camaro’s trunk opening is also rather awkward, but the seats do fold to expand cargo space.
Exterior StylingA portrait of attitude and aggressiveness, one of the biggest draws of the Camaro is its scintillating skin. From its menacing front grille and narrow headlights to its muscular rear haunches and twin tailpipes, this Chevy is an image of machismo. For 2014, the Camaro gets a sleeker yet more aggressive front fascia and an impressively redone tail that offers a sporty diffuser and wide LED taillights. Camaro SS and 1LE models now have a functional hood vent to reduce heat. Z/28 models include a full aerodynamics package that functions to provide extra downforce at high speeds on the track.
Favorite FeaturesEXTERIOR STYLINGThe latest-gen Camaro has been out a few years now, but its outward looks still turn heads, young and old. Subtle but smart updates for 2014 keep the Camaro looking fresh.
BANG FOR BUCKAlong with that style common to all Camaros, V6 models continue to offer tremendous performance for the price. Base LS models offer a bucket of fun for around $25,000.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Chevrolet Camaro is available as a coupe and convertible, and in over half a dozen trim levels. Base LS models, available as a coupe only, come with a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/satellite audio system with Bluetooth and an auxiliary jack, cruise control, 18-inch steel wheels and a limited-slip differential. LT models add features like a 7-inch touch screen, power front seats and Chevy’s MyLink telematics system with a USB input but no CD player. SS models gain the 6.2-liter V8 engine, Brembo brakes, and 20-inch wheels. Safety features on all models include six airbags, stability and traction control, and GM’s OnStar communications system with features like automatic crash response and other emergency and concierge services.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2014 Camaro include a 6-speed automatic transmission in place of the 6-speed manual, navigation, a rear-view camera, a power sunroof, and that retro-cool 4-gauge instrumentation cluster. With this car’s emphasis on performance, it’s no surprise that options abound to make it look and handle better. The RS package, for example, includes 20-inch aluminum wheels and high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights. Audio enthusiasts will be interested in the 9-speaker, 245-watt Boston Acoustics premium sound system. A 2-tone interior package gives Camaro cabins a more upscale feel.
Engine & TransmissionThe Camaro now offers five engine choices for 2014: LS and LT models use a 323-horsepower 3.6-liter direct-injected LFX V6. SS versions have a 400-horsepower 6.2-liter L99 V8 with Active Fuel Management (for automatic transmission models) or a 426-horsepower 6.2-liter LS3 V8. ZL1 models use a 580-horsepower supercharged LSA V8. New to the lineup for 2014 is a 7.0-liter LS7 naturally aspirated V8 for the Camaro Z/28, which is only available with a 6-speed manual transmission.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Camaro receives an exterior design freshening for 2014 with highlights that include redesigned front fascia and rear diffuser and taillights. The long-awaited Camaro Z/28 is returning with a 7.0-liter LS7 engine, minimal frills and a big sticker price. It claims to be the most track-capable factory-built Camaro ever made.
Ever since it burst into showrooms four years ago, Chevrolet’s latest generation Camaro has helped spark a revival among muscle cars. Like its rivals the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger, the Camaro boasts retro-inspired looks, loads of power, and decent everyday livability. And thankfully, today’s buyers don’t necessarily have to choose performance over fuel economy, with a base V6 Camaro good for 323 horsepower and up to 30 mpg. For drivers who can’t envision anything but a V8 under the hood, several iterations are available, from the 580-horsepower supercharged monster in the ZL1 to the Corvette-derived LS7 in the new, track-ready Z/28. With its exterior freshening, the 2014 Camaro coupe and convertible still drip with attitude, but interior visibility and materials leave much to be desired.

Driving the Used 2014 Ford FocusWith its internationally-inspired engineering and design foundations, the 2014 Ford Focus delivers a first-class driving experience. All trim levels are noted for a comfortable feel to the ride combined with quick response and confidence-inspiring stability. The higher trim-level Focus Titanium, when fitted with the optionally-available 18-inch wheels and 40-series tires, tends to ride a little firmer but handle even more responsively. For those times when bad weather or tricky situations require some assistance, the AdvanceTrak stability control, in combination with a torque-vectoring control system that transfers power to the wheel with the most grip, keeps things on course. With front disc/rear drum brakes on the Focus S and 4-wheel discs on higher trim levels, the brakes deliver sure stops. Even the Focus Electric can be considered fun to drive.
Interior ComfortWhile not the roomiest in its class, the cabin on the Focus boasts the look and feel of a more expensive car, reinforcing that premium character with loads of soft-touch surfaces and an abundance of sound-attenuation materials. Legible instrumentation and well-positioned controls in all versions are complemented by an 8.0-inch full-color touch-screen that replaces the normal multifunction display on Titanium models with the MyFord Touch infotainment and navigation system. The rear seat is scaled for two mid-sized adults but decently padded for three kids. Folding the 60/40 rear seatbacks to a semi-flat position adds utility to the regular Sedan’s 13.2-cubic foot conventional trunk and raises the capacity of the Hatchback’s cargo area from 23.8 to 44.8 cubic feet. However, the battery pack puts a big dent in cargo space on the Focus Electric.
Exterior StylingThe Focus sedan and hatchback embody an aggressive and aerodynamic look that is effectively reinforced by a lower, sleeker windshield rake and flowing roofline set off by smartly-stylized headlight and taillight treatments. Filling its tastefully-flared fenderwells are wheel and tire packages that range from 195/65 all-season tires on 15-inch steel wheels on the Focus S Sedan to 215/55 tires with 17-inch aluminum rims on Titanium models. The top-line Focus Titanium is also available with an optional 18-inch wheel upgrade that includes 235/40 performance tires as well as a sport-tuned suspension.
Favorite FeaturesMYFORD TOUCH Standard on Titanium trim levels, Ford’s top-line infotainment and telematics package is based on an even more advanced – and now more user-friendly – application of the automaker’s acclaimed SYNC voice-command system and includes a premium 10-speaker Sony sound system, with HD Radio, media hub, in-car Wi-Fi access and more.
GREAT DRIVING EXPERIENCEFord engineers went the extra mile to give the 2014 Focus commendable road manners and comfort, which is something we really appreciate.
Standard FeaturesEven the base Focus S sedan boasts an impressive complement of power assists, air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless remote entry, AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio, anti-lock disc/drum brakes and front, front-side and side-curtain airbags, while the SE adds SYNC with MyFord Driver Connect, cruise control, folding rear seat, 4-wheel discs, programmable MyKey and 16-inch tires on alloy wheels. The Titanium trim level has leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, push-button starting, SYNC/MyFord Touch, a 10-speaker Sony HD sound system, Sirius Satellite Radio and a 17-inch wheel and tire package. The richly-appointed Focus Electric features unique eco-fabric seat covers and adds voice-activated navigation.
Factory OptionsThe Focus S 4-door is available with the 6-speed dual-clutch auto-shifter and remote starting. SE models offer an Appearance Package (leather, 17-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, satellite radio, rear spoiler, and more), Interior Style Package (2-tone leather-trimmed seats, coordinated interior finish and steering wheel, premium floor mats, and more), Sport Package (sport cloth seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and available rear spoiler). Also available are a Winter Package, Appearance Black Package, Super Fuel Economy Package, power moonroof and navigation. Focus Titanium buyers can choose a 5-speed manual transmission, moonroof, navigation, the Technology Package, Style Packages, a Winter Package and a Handling Package.
Engine & TransmissionAll conventional 2014 Focus models are fitted with a naturally-aspirated, direct-injected 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that uses Ford’s twin-independent variable camshaft timing. This smooth free-revver makes 160 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque and can be paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic. On the SE with Sport Package and Titanium models, the automated-manual transmission adds SelectShift capability via a rocker switch on the shift lever. Auto-shifted SE sedans with the mileage-maxing SFE Package rate a 40-mpg EPA highway rating but the economy star is the Focus Electric. With a 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motor energized by a 23 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, this ultra-clean hatchback returns a remarkable 105 MPGe combined rating from the EPA.

In the intensely-competitive compact-car market, the details count for everything, and the 2014 Ford Focus covers those details. The Focus looks great on the outside without giving the impression it will fade from fashion in the next six months. The inside is modern and comfortable – it’s spacious and offers a generous assortment of premium features and touches with the ascending trim levels of S, SE and Titanium. You can have the Ford Focus as a 4-door sedan or 5-door hatchback, and it’s fully competitive with all the likely suspects, including the import nameplates of Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla and Mazda Mazda3, and its fellow domestics the Chevy Cruze and Dodge Dart.

You don’t necessarily haul a lot, but a truck would be handy; you just don’t want the harsher side of truck ownership on a daily basis. Hence, the 2014 Honda Ridgeline.
ConsIf you tow a trailer larger than 4,500 pounds, haul big loads or work a truck hard, you need a full-size pickup with a V8. But you already know that. There are lots of choices in that category; the Ridgeline is not one of them.",30000,"Driving the Used 2014 Honda RidgelineUnlike all other trucks, the 2014 Ridgeline is built with unit-construction and fully independent suspension, and it pays huge dividends in ride and handling, which is much more like a car than a truck. The ride is smooth and comfortable and soaks up big and little bumps, the handling is rock-steady on the highway and responsive around corners. Even though it weighs around 4,500 pounds, the robust 3.5-liter V6 moves it with ease. The fuel-economy ratings are good but, in view of some of the newer competition in the truck market, not at the top. On occasions we noticed the 5-speed automatic tended to shift a little abruptly, but most folks would likely not notice. In sum, driving the Ridgeline is about as unobtrusive and calm as operating a truck can be. It is certainly the perfect first truck for many buyers.
Interior ComfortThe designers who crafted the 2014 Ridgeline’s interior did just fine on function and layout of controls but could have, in our opinion, made it a little more warm and welcoming. However, the functional aspects are terrific, with storage spots throughout and a clever rear-seat bottom that can be lifted up to increase the available cargo space. And, if you order a Ridgeline with leather, the warm and welcoming factor improves significantly.
Exterior StylingWhile full-size pickups tend toward the so-called “big rig” look, with massive chrome grilles and in-your-face front ends, the 2014 Honda Ridgeline stays to its own design path. The shape is generally angular, and clearly noticeable are the big C-pillars that certainly enhance structural rigidity but just as certainly give the driver serious blind spots – when changing lanes, use the mirrors. The cargo bed length of five feet is enough for a dirt bike or an ATV, but hauling longer items means dropping the tailgate. And once you get used to that In-Bed Trunk you’ll probably never want to give it up.
Favorite FeaturesFavorite Features – Pick two (15-50 words x 2)DUAL-ACTION TAILGATE Now why didn’t we think of that? The Dual-Action Tailgate can swing down, like a conventional tailgate, or swing open, like door. It’s clever and convenient and comes in handy in surprising ways.
IN-BED TRUNKIf more trucks offered independent rear suspension (rather than a live axle), more trucks could offer an in-bed trunk. You have a cooler full of beverages? Put it back there! Need to conceal valuable items too messy to place in the cab? Put them back there!
Standard FeaturesHonda’s Variable Torque Management 4WD (VTM-4) works like a charm and, while the Ridgeline is not the best choice for hard-core off-roading, the VTM-4 is a gem of easy operation and useful capabilities when faced with slippery surfaces, such as snow, ice, mud or whatever else messes up the pavement. Additional standard equipment includes an integrated trailer hitch, all the usual power accessories, a power-sliding rear window and a host of convenience features.
Factory OptionsAs is typical of Honda, the options are mostly wrapped into trim levels of RT, Sport, RTS and RTL. The main additions of the Sport are 18-inch alloy wheels and some trim and convenience features. The RTS adds an upgraded 160-watt audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control and an 8-way power driver’s seat. The RTL adds leather seating, different alloy wheels, a power moonroof, SiriusXM satellite radio and HomeLink. Navigation is available on the RTL. The Special Edition is new for 2014, and there are numerous dealer-installed accessories.
Engine & TransmissionThe only engine available in the 2014 Ridgeline is a 3.5-liter V6 of 250 horsepower. It’s responsive, has plenty of power and has proven long-term reliability, but doesn’t match the full-size trucks’ V8s when it comes to trailer-towing punch. Still, the V6 is smooth, quiet, refined and extraordinarily reliable, and its down-the-highway performance is capable and unobtrusive. It’s matched with a 5-speed automatic transmission and, in all Ridgelines, Honda’s Variable Torque Management full-time 4-wheel drive (VTM-4) which deals with any weather and surface condition it is likely to encounter. And, if you do pull a trailer, the Ridgeline does just fine with anything up to its 4,500-pound limit.

It includes 18-inch alloy wheels with black-trimmed spokes, Special Edition badging, the black trim package from the Sport model and the Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System, with Voice Recognition and Zagat Survey restaurant information.
Although late with a pickup truck, Honda did it Honda’s way, and the 2014 Ridgeline is completely different from the crowd. Instead of a conventional body-on-frame it has unit-construction, is offered in a crew-cab version only, with one bed length and one drivetrain. It’s like a mid-size SUV that’s been reconfigured into a pickup, and is often described as the perfect truck for folks who have not yet owned a truck. That seems to be fine with its owners, and the Ridgeline fits the niche Honda invented for it. It rides, handles and drives like a car; delivers fuel efficiency roughly equal to a mid-size SUV; and includes numerous innovative features not found elsewhere. The Ridgeline really is like nothing else in the truck market.

A base CX-5 Sport with manual transmission opens just a hair under $22,000. With an automatic transmission, that price increases by $1,400. Mid-level Touring models start around $25,400, and top-line Grand Touring models open around $28,400 and reach into the low $30,000 range when loaded. Adding all-wheel drive to any of the trims costs $1,250. While the 2014 Mazda CX-5 isn’t the least expensive in the segment, it offers a lot of value – and intangibles such as driving dynamics – for the money. Kia’s Sportage and Hyundai’s Tucson undercut the CX-5’s base price by a couple thousand, while the CX-5’s base price is in line with rivals such as Honda the CR-V and Ford Escape, and is slightly below the recently revamped Toyota RAV4. Before buying, check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price below to see what others in your area are paying for the CX-5. The CX-5’s residual value is expected to be good, but not quite as high as the CR-V, RAV4 and Tucson.
Driving the Used 2014 MAZDA CX-52014 Mazda CX-5 Sport models with the 2.0-liter engine have just adequate power and acceleration – not quite the Zoom-Zoom that Mazda prides itself on. Better is the 2.5-liter Skyactiv 4-cylinder engine standard in Touring and Grand Touring models. Its higher horsepower and torque are just what the CX-5 needed. This more potent CX-5 still won’t outgun a Kia Sportage turbo or Subaru Forester turbo, but it easily stays in step with rivals like the Honda CR-V and offers good off-the-line acceleration. Drivers willing to shift for themselves – and who won’t mind a lack of creature comforts – will be rewarded with one of the best manual transmissions we’ve used in an SUV. With the short-throw 6-speed manual, the CX-5 is even more fun to drive, and this trim’s lighter weight adds to its nimbleness. With a manual transmission this good, we wish it weren’t restricted to the basest of CX-5 models.
Interior ComfortInside the 2014 Mazda CX-5 are two rows of seats that hold up to five passengers. Cloth is the standard seat fabric in Sport and Touring models, while top-line Grand Touring models are graced with well-bolstered leather. Rear legroom is generous and is comfortable for two adults. Behind the rear seat is a commendable 34.1 cubic feet of storage space, enough to hold plenty of groceries or several suitcases. That room nearly doubles with the seats folded, a task easily performed with a single button. Dash controls for setting audio and climate features are easy to find and use.
Exterior StylingThe CX-5 is the first Mazda to embody the automaker’s ""Kodo – Soul of Motion"" styling. Fancy language aside, the 2014 CX-5 is defined curves that are both elegant and muscular. Viewed from the side, the CX-5 has a slightly forward stance that makes it appear athletic, ready to pounce. A standard rear roof spoiler and dual rear exhaust outlets add more visual cues to the CX-5’s peppy nature. Even the base Sport model comes clad in 17-inch wheels, with Grand Touring models dressed in even larger 19-inch aluminum-alloys. An optional roof rack can add functionality for securing gear on all models.
Favorite FeaturesSMART CITY BRAKE SUPPORTAutomatic braking systems are usually reserved for luxury cars, so it’s refreshing to see one in a mid-$20,000 mainstream SUV. At speeds of 3 to 19 mph – as in heavy traffic with potential for driver distraction – the system automatically applies the brakes if its laser senses an impending collision.
SKYACTIV TECHNOLOGYThe name may be marketing, but the results are real: zippy performance without penalty to fuel economy. More than just advanced engine technology, Skyactiv emphasizes lightweight materials, aerodynamic bodies and even improved vehicle structure integrity for improved safety.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Mazda CX-5 is available in three trims: Sport, Touring and, at the top, Grand Touring. The base Sport version is well equipped with push-button start, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/USB audio, cruise control and 17-inch wheels, but the Touring and Grand Touring models offer really impressive features for the money. The Touring model comes with the more powerful 2.5-liter engine, blind-spot monitoring, Bluetooth, 6-speaker audio with HD Radio, a rearview camera, and a 5.8-inch color display. Grand Touring models add leather, 9-speaker Bose audio, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and 19-inch alloy wheels. Stability/traction control, antilock brakes, and front, side and side-curtain airbags are all standard.
Factory OptionsAll CX-5 models except the base Sport version with manual transmission can be had with traction-enhancing all-wheel drive (AWD). Packages and options vary by trim. Sport models with automatic transmissions can get a Bluetooth package that includes HD and Pandora Internet radio, and a 5.8-inch color screen. The Smart City Brake Support system is available on Touring and Grand Touring models, as is navigation, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, high-intensity discharge headlights, and adaptive front lighting. Other options available on various models include front and rear parking sensors, a trailer hitch, and fog lights, keyless entry, and SiriusXM satellite radio.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2014, two engine choices are offered in the Mazda CX-5 crossover SUV. Sport models feature Mazda’s 155-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder mated to great-feeling a 6-speed manual transmission or a smooth 6-speed automatic. Touring and Grand Touring versions of the 2014 CX-5 come with a more powerful 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and the 6-speed automatic. All-wheel drive can be had in place of front-wheel drive on all models except a Sport with the manual transmission. Both CX-5 engines are advanced, using higher compression rates to literally squeeze the most energy out of gasoline. Thankfully, unlike other highly advanced engines, those in the 2014 CX-5 run on regular, 87-octane unleaded. Towing capacity is rated at a maximum of 2,000 pounds for all CX-5 models. No word yet on the chance of a diesel CX-5 coming to the U.S.

Read Full Review","What's New?The biggest news for 2014 is the more powerful 2.5-liter engine in Touring and Grand Touring models of the Mazda CX-5. On the safety front, the CX-5 is available with Smart City Brake Support, which can automatically stop the car in lower-speed situations when a collision appears imminent.
The 2014 CX-5 is Mazda’s impressive entry in the compact SUV segment, where it competes with veterans like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape. Introduced for 2013, the CX-5 is the first vehicle designed from the ground up using Mazda’s Skyactiv technologies aimed at marrying efficiency and performance. The CX-5 offers both, along with value and advanced safety features. Fun-to-drive manners are seldom associated with SUVs, but the CX-5 has those, too. If there was one fly in the 2013 CX-5’s ointment, it was modest power output. Mazda has addressed that for 2014 with an available engine that is more potent yet still fuel-thrifty. In the face of formidable rivals, the CX-5 endears with a scrappy nature akin to David vs. multiple Goliaths. That’s why we named it one of the 10 Best SUVs Under"

Driving the Used 2014 BMW 3 SeriesA major element of 3 Series appeal is their driving dynamics. They consistently perform at or near the top of their segment in terms of ride and handling. The exception is the bigger, heavier Gran Turismo hatchback, which isn’t as nimble as its siblings. The 3 Series’ fuel-saving stop/start feature shudders during engine shutdown, and again when the system restarts. Drivers can deactivate stop/start by pressing a button on the dash each time they start the car. The delightfully torque-rich turbo-6 is good for 5.4-second 0-60 bursts, but the surprising turbo-4 is only about a half-second slower. The down-powered 320i gets to 60 mph in roughly 7.1 seconds. The diesel engine delivers strong performance and excellent fuel economy. As a bonus, the twin-scroll turbocharger used on all powerplants is virtually free of turbo lag. In late 2014, the next-generation BMW M3 will arrive.
Interior ComfortBMW calls its 2014 3 Series interior ""straight out of the BMW design handbook,"" meaning an uncomplicated look with tight fits, simple shapes and upscale materials. The cockpit, angled toward the driver by seven degrees, presents important controls within easy reach. Overall, the cabin is quite spacious, and the rear quarters offer more legroom than the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and Infiniti Q50. The console-mounted iDrive controller is handy to both driver and front passenger, and its freestanding central screen boasts an HDTV-like trans-reflective, high-resolution display. On the practicality front, 3 Series Sport Wagon and Gran Turismo models maintain a sizable advantage over their sedan-only rivals like the Lexus IS and Infiniti G when it comes to hauling cargo.
Exterior StylingWhen BMW’s 1977 3 Series replaced the respected but ungainly 2002, its styling was a pleasant surprise. Thirty-six years later, its evolving design has never again surprised, and that’s a good thing. Line up all six generations, and the evolution is so apparent that even casual observers have no doubt what it is. Today’s slightly longer and taller model differentiates itself mostly by adding more defined character lines and creases, along with a visual connection between the headlights and the marque’s signature twin-kidney grilles. The Gran Turismo hatchback, on the other hand, is an acquired taste.
Favorite FeaturesBMW APPSiPhone users can access a number of popular mobile applications like Glympse location sharing data, audio books by Audible, and TuneIn radio via the standard navigation system display and iDrive controls. BMW Apps can even read aloud Twitter and Facebook feeds.
SURROUND VIEW SYSTEMCameras in the outside mirrors provide a bird’s-eye top view of the area around the car to aid maneuvering in tight spaces, while the selectable Side View function uses cameras in the sides of the front bumper to monitor traffic crossing in front of the car.
Standard FeaturesStraight out of the box, base 320i trims come equipped with leatherette (vinyl) upholstery, manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, and a 9-speaker sound system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, a USB port, and HD Radio. For comparison, the less expensive Acura TSX and Audi A4 offer power front seats and leather as standard fare. Safety features standard on every 2014 BMW 3 Series model consist of eight airbags, active head rests to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and disengage potentially hazardous electrical systems in the event of a collision.
Factory OptionsIn typical BMW fashion, the options list for the 2014 3 Series is both extensive and pricey. Features we feel are worth their weight in gold include the above-mentioned Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, navigation with programmable waypoints, a head-up display that projects pertinent driving information onto the windshield, and adaptive cruise control designed to maintain a preselected distance behind the vehicle ahead. The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the available M Sport Package help bridge the performance gap between the standard 3 Series and the fire-breathing M3.
Engine & TransmissionTwo turbocharged gasoline engines are offered in 2014 3 Series lineup: A 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in 320i and 328i models (detuned in the 320i) and the 3.0-liter inline-6 in 335i models. Both engines drive the rear or all four wheels through a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission. Diesel models get a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that packs nearly the same low-end torque as the 6-cylinder, but with significant fuel economy benefits. The ActiveHybrid 3 marries a 55-hp electric motor (packaged inside the 8-speed automatic housing and driven by a lithium-ion battery) to the turbo-6 for a combined 335 hp (not the sum of both peak outputs, since both engine and motor can’t operate at max power simultaneously).

For more than 30 years, the BMW 3 Series has set the standard for entry-level luxury sedans. Despite the best efforts of age-old rivals like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4 and Lexus IS, the 3 Series continues on as the undisputed benchmark in the category. This level of dominance is owed in large part to the variety of configurations that comprise the 3 Series line, including the multifaceted Sport Wagon, a fuel-sipping diesel, and an all-new Gran Turismo hatchback. To make the nameplate more accessible, the newly available 320i trim delivers 3 Series prestige at a buyer-friendly price. As for coupe and convertible versions, they will migrate to the forthcoming 4 Series platform, leaving the 2014 BMW 3 Series with an all-4-door portfolio.

And newer models such as the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio offer many of the same qualities at a lower price.",14795,"Driving the Used 2014 Ford FiestaFord maintained the excellent European chassis feel when it brought the Fiesta to the U.S. On the highway, the Fiesta delivers a ride that is both comfortable and controlled. Push the car through a curving on-ramp or twisting back road and you’ll enjoy its balance, response and communication. The Fiesta’s standard 120-hp 4-cylinder engine can feel a little weak, but for 2014 there are two new EcoBoost alternatives. The unique 3-cylinder 1.0-liter places an emphasis on fuel efficiency but also offers good, flexible thrust. The 1.6 4-cylinder in the high-spirited ST model delivers a sparkling 197 horsepower, a number nothing else in this class approaches. (Stiffer suspension and quicker steering further enliven the ST driving experience.) The standard 5-speed manual transmission (6-speed in the ST) helps wring out good acceleration. The 6-speed automatic, available with the standard engine, is a sophisticated dual-clutch design, but it lacks a manual-control option.
Interior ComfortOne reason to pick the Fiesta over its Asian competitors is inside. Ford has done a masterful job with the Fiesta’s interior styling and execution, offering a number of distinctive interior choices, such as white/black leather seating, contrasting piping and plum leather seating surfaces. Soft-touch materials are where you want them (armrest, console lid, steering wheel) and high-end options include heated front seats, push-button start and multi-color selectable ambient lighting. Navigation is now available on higher-trim models.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Ford Fiesta subcompact comes in 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback versions. Both are functional and blessed with strong character lines, befitting the savvy young buyers Ford is after. Front and rear aspects are face-lifted for this year, and the new ST model gets its own more aggressive treatments for the grille, lower spoiler and rocker panels. The Hatch has been equipped and positioned as the primary model. Thankfully, cheap-looking unpainted parts and ugly wheel covers are nowhere in sight. You can add sporty 17-inch aluminum wheels, keyless-entry keypads and a host of bright paint colors.

It also gets all the safety goodies, like electronic stability control and seven airbags – including the category’s first driver’s-side knee airbag. Base-model limitations include 15-inch covered steel wheels and roll-‘em-up manual crank windows, but SYNC is now included.
Factory OptionsA fully-loaded 2014 Ford Fiesta Titanium includes a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather seats, moonroof, keyless entry and start, voice-controlled SYNC smart phone integration, steering-wheel-mounted audio and cruise controls, heated seats, satellite radio and a trip computer. That’s a generous list for an economical subcompact. The new high-performance ST model offers a Recaro seating package that includes leather trim, seat heaters and heated outside mirrors.
Engine & TransmissionA lot is happening in the Fiesta’s engine compartment for 2014. The standard 1.6-liter 4-cylinder is joined by a pair of turbocharged EcoBoost engines. The unique 999-cc 3-cylinder EcoBoost 1.0 puts out just three more horsepower than the standard engine, but more torque – good for acceleration – at much lower revs. Official EPA estimates are still to come, but Ford is confident this will be the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid car on the market. Turbocharging the standard engine creates the EcoBoost 1.6, with its eye-opening 197 horsepower in the ST model. For now, the EcoBoost engines come only with manual gearboxes, a 5-speed with the 1.0 and a 6-speed with the 1.6. The base engine offers a choice of the 5-speed manual or Ford’s twin-clutch 6-speed automatic.

The ST model, with its 197-horsepower EcoBoost 1.6 engine, becomes the presumptive King Hot Hatch in the sub-compact category. A unique 3-cylinder EcoBoost 1.0 is optional in the other models.
The 2014 Ford Fiesta may be the only American sub-compact that can truly stand up to the Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris. Slick Eurostyle looks, outstanding fuel economy and true fun-to-drive chassis tuning do the trick. The Fiesta also loads on features unexpected in this class, including wild interior and exterior colors, a version of Ford’s SYNC infotainment system and a dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Ford Fiesta is available as a 4-door sedan and a 5-door hatchback, in S, SE and Titanium trim levels. A new high-performance hatch-only ST model joins the line this year, with a turbocharged 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine. Also new is an available 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine that Ford says is the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid on the market.

Key among them are the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4, but none of those worthy competitors currently offers a V6 option. Both the Escape and RAV4 previously offered V6s, but both went the 4-cylinder-only route after recent re-designs. In making your choice, you might look to what is most important to you. If you want the Jeep name, serious off-roading chops and reasonable towing capabilities, the Cherokee is the choice. If you do light-duty off-roading or no off-roading at all, other vehicles offer more interior space. That said the Cherokee is a good all-around SUV, and we expect it to deliver average to above-average resale value in its class.
Driving the Used 2014 Jeep CherokeeThe Jeep Cherokee is offered in four trims levels – Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk – and all but the Trailhawk are available in either front-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive (4WD) configurations. A very clever chameleon, its on-road behavior is in keeping with everything else in the class – perfectly acceptable but largely uninvolving. Acceleration from the 4-cylinder is adequate, and, as you’d expect, response from the V6-powered version is better. But when you get the Cherokee off pavement, the world changes. Equipped with any of its three 4WD systems – Jeep Active Drive I, Active Drive II and Active Drive Lock – the Cherokee offers class-leading off-road prowess. One key reason is the standard Selec-Terrain traction-control system, which allows the driver to choose settings for optimum performance, including settings for Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and Rock. It also has an “Auto” setting that decides for you, based on what the Cherokee’s systems sense. All models offer good approach and departure angles plus reasonable ground clearance, while the Trailhawk version ups the ante in each department. Bottom line: the Cherokee performs very well as a daily driver, while at the same time offering you more traction enhancement than you’ll probably ever need.
Interior ComfortBoth Jeep heritage (the trapezoidal “center stack”) and Americana (an instrument panel layout that mimics the spread wings of an eagle) are represented in the 2014 Cherokee’s attractive, upscale interior. The ergonomically designed seats offer good support and are trimmed with attractive cloth or Nappa leather. The top-of-the-line seats are power-adjustable, heated/ventilated and feature memory settings. The 60/40-split 2nd-row seats move forward and backward for increased passenger comfort and cargo flexibility. Among the coolest features are an available wireless-device charging pad and a glovebox so large “you could put a turkey in it,” joked the Cherokee’s lead interior designer, Winnie Chung. We also liked the optional 7-inch full-color configurable instrument cluster that functions like a smartphone.
Exterior StylingThe exterior design of the Cherokee is nothing if not controversial. Some critics have slammed the “kink” in the iconic 7-portal grille, but chief exterior designer Mark Allen noted that other Jeeps featured a somewhat similar front-end treatment. Fact is, this SUV looks much better in person than in photographs, and we warmed up to it quickly. The Cherokee is built off the same front-drive platform as the Dodge Dart, and we think the design and engineering team did a remarkable job in turning it into a vehicle that can truly be called a Jeep. The Trailhawk version kicks up the macho up a notch with a higher ride height, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear fascias. For those who like to add open-air to their off-roading, the Cherokee offers a CommandView panoramic sunroof or the Sky Slider full-length-opening canvas roof.
Favorite Features948TE 9-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONDeveloped by global transmission giant ZF, Chrysler Group’s 9-speed automatic transmission is standard equipment in all models of the new Cherokee. We appreciated its smooth launches and excellent power delivery, and the biggest plus is fuel economy that is vastly improved over the Liberty’s 4-speed automatic.
SELEC-TERRAINInstead of relying on sheer muscle and torque multiplication, Selec-Terrain electronically coordinates and optimizes up to 12 separate vehicle systems to deliver control tailored to the environment you are traversing. Among the systems that get its special touch are the drivetrain control module, electronic brake controller, electronic stability control, transmission, and powertrain controller.
Standard FeaturesThe base Cherokee Sport is powered by the new 2.4-liter MultiAir2 Tigershark 4-cylinder engine offering praiseworthy fuel economy and a range of some 500 miles on a tankful. Standard equipment includes Uconnect 5-inch touch-screen media center with Bluetooth for hands-free phone and streaming audio, a media hub that offers USB, SD and auxiliary ports and charging capability, a 3.5-inch full-color center cluster, 10 air bags, anti-lock disc brakes, electronic stability control, traction control, Hill-start Assist, electric power steering, an electric park brake, cruise control, air conditioning with rear outlets, and remote keyless entry. The Jeep Cargo Management system includes standard hooks and a storage tote, and accessories are available.
Factory OptionsJeep figures the Latitude model will be the best seller, and its prime calling card is the availability of the 3.2-liter Pentastar V6 engine. It also offers two 4WD systems: Jeep Active Drive I, Jeep Active Drive II. Added standard niceties include a fold-flat front-passenger seat with under-cushion storage space, 17-inch aluminum wheels and a 115-volt outlet. Options include the Uconnect infotainment system with an 8.4-inch touch screen, Alpine premium audio with nine speakers and a subwoofer, and the CommandView dual-pane panoramic sunroof with power sunshade. The Cherokee Limited adds leather, heated power seats, a heated steering wheel, Keyless Enter-N-Go, automatic headlights, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. The trim level also features the Uconnect 8.4 system with SiriusXM Radio, ParkView rear backup camera, remote start, and dual-zone automatic temperature control. The Trailhawk isn’t the traditional top-of-the-line trim model. Instead it concentrates on a variety of equipment that add off-road capabilities.
Engine & TransmissionWhile many models in the segment are ditching their 6-cylinder variants to concentrate on the fuel-economy of the 4-cylinders, Jeep is adamant about offering a V6 version of the Cherokee. Its 3.2-liter Pentastar V6 engine produces 271 horsepower, 239 lb-ft of torque and delivers best-in-class V6 towing of 4,500 pounds. The 16-valve, 2.4-liter Tigershark MultiAir2 4-cylinder engine, standard in the 2014 Jeep Cherokee, is the more technically interesting of the two engine choices. Using an electro-hydraulic fully variable valve-lift system, the 2.4-liter engine produces 184 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. Perhaps more important, it offers an estimated 31-mpg highway fuel economy rating. That’s more than a 45-percent improvement versus the outgoing model. The 9-speed automatic transmission, a first in the segment, is standard equipment in all models of the new Cherokee.

Adding the EyeSight + Keyless Access & Start Package to either Forester Touring variant raises its sticker by $2,400. All of those figures reflect significant advantages compared to most of the Forester’s primary segment competitors – in some cases, undercutting even comparably equipped front-drive versions of those rivals. While Kelley Blue Book has not yet issued residual value ratings for the 2014 Forester, this Subaru SUV has historically ranked at or near the top of its category and there’s no reason to expect the new and improved version won’t continue to carry on that tradition.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru ForesterBoasting a stronger, more rigid central structure, wider track dimensions, longer wheelbase and a retuned suspension to complement Subaru’s signature Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, the 2014 Forester deports itself most impressively and predictably on or off road. New, more efficient electrically-boosted power steering provides more positive feedback while the revamped chassis does an admirable job of keeping body roll in check under hard cornering. Tauter underpinnings on 2.0XT models add extra sportiness with minimal impact on ride compliance while the tri-mode SI-Drive feature on the turbo-spec CVT allows one to better exploit the 80-horsepower advantage this engine has over the one in its naturally aspirated 2.5i sibling – an edge that helps trim the 2.0XT’s 0-60 mph times from 9.3 to 6.3 seconds. The X-Mode feature on upline Forester variants provides its own kind of multi-terrain confidence boost on slick paved roads or in the dirt at speeds up to 25 mph.
Interior ComfortImpressively expanded, well-finished and well-appointed, the Forester’s restyled passenger cabin is quieter and more comfortable than ever with lots more soft-touch surfaces as well as redesigned seats that offer improved support and have been repositioned to afford better sightlines. Larger, wider-opening doors ease access/egress for people and legroom in the 60/40 rear bench has been increased by a huge 3.1 inches. When cargo takes precedence, the backs now fold even flatter to stretch stow space from 34.4 to 74.7 cubic feet – a 9-percent overall increase. The larger liftgate, which is power-activated on Limited/Touring models, simplifies the loading and unloading process.
Exterior StylingStill unmistakably Subaru, the Gen IV remake endows the 2014 Forester with more contemporary character. The visual recasting is most evident in 2.0XT models that feature a bolder front fascia treatment and subtle rear roof spoiler, and wrap 225/55 all-season tires around 18-inch alloy wheels where the 2.5i contingent is shod with 225/60 rubber on either 17-inch styled-steel or alloy rims. Slightly longer, wider and taller than the 2013 Forester, this latest iteration also has a more planted appearance thanks to wider track dimensions and nearly an inch more wheelbase. All models also provide an impressive 8.7 inches of ground clearance.
Favorite FeaturesLINEARTRONIC CVT TRANSMISSION Optional on 2.5i/2.5i Premium models and standard on all other Foresters, Subaru’s Lineartronic continuously variable automatic (CVT) comes in two forms. While both contribute to significant fuel economy gains, the 2.0XT’s uprated unit includes paddle shifters and Subaru’s multi-mode (Intelligent/Sport/Sport Sharp) SI-Drive that can emulate both a 6-speed and 8-speed automatic.
X-MODE WITH HILL DESCENT CONTROLStandard on 2.5i Limited and all higher-level Forester models, Subaru’s new driver-selectable X-Mode integrates and optimizes operation of the throttle, transmission, AWD, Vehicle Dynamic Control, and Hill Descent Control systems to enhance the Forester’s low-speed operational capabilities on inclines and when negotiating various low-friction surfaces.
Standard FeaturesProgressing through its model hierarchy richens the Forester’s equipment mix, but even the 2.5i features a full array of power assists, air conditioning, cruise control, a multifunction steering wheel, Bluetooth, and variable wipers. The 2.5i Premium gains a rear-vision camera, an enhanced audio system and the All-Weather Package (manual only) or panoramic power moonroof (CVT only). Key gains on the 2.5i Limited model include the Lineartronic CVT, leather upholstery, reclining rear seatbacks, automatic climate control, and a power liftgate. Moving up to Touring brings electroluminescent gauges, a touch-screen navigation system, a 440-watt harman/kardon premium audio with SiriusXM Satellite Radio/Nav Traffic, dual-zone climate control, and more.
Factory OptionsModestly scaled, the roster of Forester extras is based on model/trim levels. The Lineartronic CVT is available on the 2.5i/2.5i Premium, while the 2.5i Premium with CVT also can be had with the All-Weather Package (standard on Foresters with the 6-speed manual transmission). Both the 2.5i Premium and Limited offer a touch-screen navigation system with 6.1-inch display, HD radio, Satellite Radio, NavTraffic, and more. Touring-level 2.5i/2.0XT models can be fitted with the Driver Assist Technology Package that adds the EyeSight System (Adaptive Cruise Control, Pre-Collision Braking, and Vehicle Lane Departure Warning), plus Keyless Access/Start and high-intensity-discharge headlights.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Forester offers two 4-cylinder ""boxer"" engines. Naturally aspirated, the carryover, PZEV-clean 170-horsepower/2.5-liter can be backed by a new 6-speed manual transmission that replaces the current 5-speed or a new efficiency-boosting Lineartronic CVT automatic from the Impreza. Forester 2.0XT models get a new turbocharged, direct-injected engine derived from the flat-4 used in the Subaru BRZ. Here, it develops 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, way up from the 225/226 output figures in the 2.5-liter turbo used in the 2013 Forester. The sole transmission for the turbocharged engine is a new High-Torque Lineartronic CVT with multi-mode SI-Drive that can emulate six or eight virtual gear ratios. All versions of the 2014 Forester boast significant fuel-economy gains over 2013 models and have a 1,500-pound tow rating.

Read Full Review","What's New?Redesigned from the ground up, the 2014 Forester raises its practical and personable character to an even higher level, gaining a new sense of style, more space, additional refinement, better performance and improved fuel economy.
Fully redesigned, the 2014 Subaru Forester enters its 4th generation the beneficiary of a comprehensive improvement program that makes this mainstay of the automaker’s lineup an even more attractive choice in one of today’s hottest segments. Available in several naturally aspirated (2.5i) and turbocharged (2.0XT ) trim grades, each with standard all-wheel drive (AWD), this compact 5-passenger SUV complements a new sense of style and refinement with numerous structural and chassis enhancements, more fuel-efficient powertrains, greater passenger/cargo space and significant new tech touches. Collectively, they help bolster the 2014 Forester’s performance, safety and overall desirability in ways that should serve it well against key rivals like the Buick Encore, Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV4. That’s why we named the Subaru Forester one of the 10 Best SUVs Under"

If all-wheel drive or sporty driving manners are on your wish list, check out the Subaru Impreza or Mazda’s Mazda3.",25000,"Just a few short years ago, the compact-sedan segment was dominated by foreign automakers. Fast-forward to today, though, and we see extremely respectable models coming from the domestics. Among them is the Chevrolet Cruze, which burst onto the scene a couple of years ago with good looks, smart features, lofty fuel economy and a comfortable ride. The Cruze doesn’t feel like an economy car, and its sales have proven that a quality compact from an American automaker can connect with buyers. The Cruze isn’t the sportiest sedan in the segment – which includes the Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla – but it offers impressive comfort and fuel economy. That latter characteristic gets a further lift in 2014 with the introduction of a turbodiesel model.
Used 2014 Chevrolet Cruze PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the Chevrolet Cruze starts around $18,000 for a base LS model with a manual transmission. Moving up to an LS with an automatic adds about $1,000 more. The top gasoline trim is the LTZ, which starts at over $24,000. At $25,695, the 2014 Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel represents the highest trim level and most expensive version of the Cruze. Compared with other compact sedans, the Cruze’s starting price is in line with that of the Honda Civic, but on the high side of the Ford Focus, Nissan Sentra, Kia Forte and Dodge Dart. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2014 Cruze. In terms of resale value, the Cruze is expected to be mid-pack in the segment with values similar to Hyundai Elantra and below leaders such as Honda Civic and Subaru Impreza.
Driving the Used 2014 Chevrolet CruzeWhether running errands around town or, yes, cruising on the highway, the 2014 Cruze’s driving manners stand out for their comfort and refinement. While most compact cars have no problem shuffling short distances, offering similar levels of ease on long commutes can be another matter. Here the Cruze lives up to its name with impressive smoothness. The 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder found on most models puts out the same 138 horsepower and more torque as the larger, naturally aspirated (non-turbo) engine found on base LS trims, yet achieves better fuel economy. Unfortunately some turbo lag was evident from a dead stop, and the 6-speed automatic transmission in our test model was a bit sluggish to downshift. The Cruze’s steering is a bit numb in the corners but nicely weighted. Stay tuned for our impressions of the diesel model, slated to arrive in summer.
Interior ComfortFor a compact car, the Chevrolet Cruze’s interior is surprisingly roomy. In fact, it qualifies as a mid-size sedan, according the EPA’s rating system. Material quality is impressive. Controls for functions such as audio and climate are easy to see, reach and use. The Cruze is commendable when it comes to seat comfort. Front legroom is excellent, while the rear bench seat is comfortable for two adults, provided the front seats are not fully extended. Higher-trim models have leather seating standard in place of cloth. Abundant sound-deadening material makes the Cruze’s cabin one of the quietest in the segment.
Exterior StylingThe Chevrolet Cruze’s exterior styling is neither bold nor bland. We predict that the sedan’s angled lines and confident stance will hold up well in the years to come. In front, the Cruze is highlighted by a split front grille that has become the ""face"" of other Chevrolets. What is perhaps the sedan’s most striking feature are its headlights and lens housings that wrap around the front and angle sharply above the front fenders. Despite the Cruze’s cavernous cargo hold, the car’s trunk lid and rear are surprisingly tidy. Wheel sizes range from 16 to 18 inches.
Favorite Features1.4-LITER ECOTEC TURBO ENGINEThe 2014 Chevrolet Cruze sedan’s 4-cylinder turbocharged engine not only delivers ample torque for a relatively fun driving experience, it’s also quiet and fuel-efficient. Drivers who enjoy shifting for themselves will appreciate the Cruze’s light and easy-to-use manual transmission.
MYLINK INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMMyLink provides voice controls for the phone, music and radio, as well as Bluetooth music streaming. MyLink can also pair with certain smartphones to stream popular apps such as Stitcher and Pandora.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Chevrolet Cruze comes in six trim levels that admittedly seem like alphabet soup: LS, 1LT, Eco, 2LT, LTZ, and Diesel. Even a base LS is reasonably well-equipped with premium cloth seating, Bluetooth, a 6-speaker AM/FM/XM/CD/USB audio system, keyless entry, and a 6-month trial of GM’s OnStar service. The LS does not come with cruise control. It is also the only gasoline model to use the 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine – the others employ the smaller, more efficient 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. The Diesel is now the top banana of Cruze models and brings leather seats, remote starting, and MyLink audio system with 7-inch touchscreen display. All models have an impressive 10 airbags.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2014 Chevy Cruze vary by trim and include navigation, a rear-view camera, 9-speaker Pioneer premium audio, a power driver’s seat, a power sunroof, and a remote vehicle starter. An RS package offers a sportier look with a rear spoiler, lower bodywork, fog lights, and unique front and rear fascias. Enhanced safety features include blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear park assist.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available for the 2014 Cruze. The two gasoline models use a naturally-aspirated 1.8-liter 4-cylinder or a smaller, more-efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder. Both gasoline engines make 138 horsepower and run on regular unleaded. The third choice is a new 2.0-liter turbodiesel that makes an estimated 148 horsepower and impressive 258 lb-ft of torque. The diesel is estimated to earn a stunning 46 miles per gallon in highway driving, but a rancid 27 mpg in the city. While that figure is close to the manual-transmission Cruze Eco, we’ve found that diesels often get better-than-stated highway fuel efficiency. The diesel uses an emissions fluid that requires refilling every 10,000 miles to coincide with oil changes. The 2014 Cruze Diesel includes a 2-year maintenance plan. Gasoline models offer a choice of 6-speed manual or auto transmission, while diesels exclusively use a 6-speed automatic.

See your local Toyota dealer and check out the 2014 Prius V.,"ConsHybrids are not inexpensive so you have to carefully figure the long-term benefits compared to something else that doesn’t offer the superb fuel economy but costs less to buy. And if you need to tow even a fairly small trailer, consider a compact or mid-size SUV.",27500,"Driving the Used 2014 Toyota Prius vIt’s unlikely that many people buy a hybrid for the enthusiastic driving experience but, still, the 2014 Prius V deals more than just competently with city traffic and merges easily with freeways. If a little more is needed, there’s the Power mode. The ride and handling qualify as comfortable, stable and predictable, but it’s certainly not a corner-carver. If that’s your goal, you obviously should be looking somewhere else. Hybrids have come a long way and the Prius V delivers a refined progression down the road, with the transitions between the electric motor and gasoline engine developed to a point of being near-seamless and, at least, not at all bothersome. If this is your first hybrid, there will be a slight adjustment period, but it’s short and easy and absolutely worth the tremendous savings in fuel costs.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Toyota Prius V offers generous interior room and useful versatility for carrying people or hauling cargo with ease. The rear seat can slide fore and aft to increase legroom or cargo space behind the seat, and it also folds over for more cargo space or will recline to enhance comfort. In addition, the front-passenger seat folds flat for hauling long items. There are storage spots throughout the interior, including space under the rear seats for such as umbrellas. And, in front, the open center stack gives a feeling of expansion and roominess. The “V” for “versatility” is entirely appropriate.
Exterior StylingThere is no doubt the 2014 Toyota Prius V is a Prius, with the strong family resemblance from front to rear. One difference in the shape is that the rear of the Prius V is larger than that of the regular Prius, without the sloping hatch configuration, for the added cargo space. Clearly, this design is based on the combined functions of generous interior room and reduced aerodynamic drag for good fuel economy. Prius V Two and Three models have 16-inch alloy wheels and the upper-end Prius V Five has 17-inchers. There is no “One” or “Five” trim level.
Favorite FeaturesVERSATILE INTERIOR SPACEVersatility is the name of the game for the Prius V’s interior. The rear seats slide to create legroom for passengers or space in the cargo bay for gear. In addition to folding in a 60/40 split, the rear seats recline. Need to carry a surfboard? The front-passenger seat folds flat, too.
OUTSTANDING FUEL ECONOMYIf drastically reducing your fuel costs isn’t the biggest reason for purchasing a hybrid, then what is? The Prius V certainly delivers, with EPA ratings of 44 mpg city, 40 highway and 42 combined. Toyota has been at this a long time, so the expected reliability should deliver lots of peace of mind.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Prius V is offered in three trim levels: Two, Three and Five. A base model Two includes automatic climate control, a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with auxiliary input and 6.1-inch touch screen, rearview camera, remote keyless entry and five cup holders. Prius V Five models add the Entune infotainment system with navigation, heated front seats, LED headlights and integrated fog lights. For 2014 all models are equipped with Daytime Running Lights, electronic stability controls and driving aids as standard, and there is a comprehensive array of occupant-protection features.
Factory OptionsThe major option for the 2014 Prius V is the Advanced Technology Package, available only on the top-line Prius V Five. The package includes a Panoramic View Moonroof, premium JBL audio system, dynamic radar cruise control, 7-inch touch-screen display and a system to help with parallel parking. The Panoramic View Moonroof is available as a stand-alone option on the Prius V Three.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Toyota Prius V is powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine matched with a 60-kilowatt electric motor, sending power to the front wheels through a gearless, continuously-variable automatic transmission (CVT). Except for a slightly revised CVT to accommodate the added mass, the Prius V’s powertrain is the same that of the Prius. The drivetrain is certainly not a tire-scorcher but it delivers reliable power for dealing with urban conditions or merging with freeway traffic. And Toyota has years of hybrid experience, so Prius V owners can do their motoring with the peace of mind that comes with proven reliability.

While it’s quick enough and handles just fine, the Forte falls far short of the Ford Focus, Mazda3 and Volkswagen Jetta in driving feel, which is a big part of fun-to-drive. But as long as you’re among the 99% of buyers more interested in transportation than track time, you won’t find anything not to like about the way the Forte drives, rides or handles. On the other hand, the 2-door Forte Koup and turbocharged Forte5 hatchback still have driving dynamics several steps behind cars like the Honda Civic Si or Volkswagen GTI, something Kia must fix if it hopes to be a player in the sporty compact segment. Still, the Kia Forte is a fun car, but more because of its looks, features and tech than its driving dynamics.
Interior ComfortThe interior of the 2014 Kia Forte is sporty and straightforward, with a heavy helping of tech and just a whiff of whimsy thanks in large part to vertical ripples in the passenger-side dash. It’s all very well done. The back seat is average in size for the category, but the Forte does boast the uncommon option of heated rear seats, and even a heated steering wheel. The trunk is among the category’s roomiest, measuring almost 15 cubic feet.
Exterior StylingOn one hand, the Kia Forte isn’t as flashy as its Hyundai Elantra corporate cousin. On the other hand, the Forte’s look will probably age better because of it. The 2-door Koup and hatchback Forte5 bring a bit more style to the lineup without undermining the conservative aesthetic. Here, Kia’s healthy addiction to category-first features manifests itself in power-folding exterior mirrors, puddle lamps and illuminated door-handle pockets, a collection of niceties not offered on most luxury cars in 2013.
Favorite FeaturesUVO ESERVICESIn addition to a bunch of other cool infotainment capabilities – many of them voice-activated – Kia’s next-gen UVO system leverages your Bluetooth-connected smartphone to automatically call 911 in the event of an airbag deployment, and lets you send a navigation destination from your computer to the car.
FLEXSTEERAs part of its new electric power steering system, the 2014 Kia Forte EX includes a FlexSteer feature that lets the driver select between Comfort, Normal and Sport steering modes. Comfort mode feels the least artificial, making small corrections easier and mitigating some of the compromise of efficiency-enhancing electric steering.
Standard FeaturesTechnically, the 2014 Kia Forte starts at $16,700 with destination, including Bluetooth and USB connectivity, air conditioning, and a split-folding rear seat. But it also has small steel wheels, a manual transmission and a host of feature deficiencies. Add $1,500 for an automatic transmission, then another $900 for the Popular Package – alloy wheels, remote keyless entry, etc. – and you’ve got yourself a respectable compact car, but for $19,100. The $19,400 Forte Koup and $20,500 Forte5 both start a trim-level higher, and include a lot of what’s optional on the sedan. A full complement of active and passive safety features are standard on every Forte.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded 2014 Kia Forte can surpass $25,000, but with an impressive set of equipment that includes common touches like leather seats, moonroof, keyless entry and push-button start, plus unexpected touches like a heated steering wheel, ventilated driver’s seat and heated rear seats. The Google-powered UVO eServices infotainment system is also among the most comprehensive systems in the segment. Moving up to the turbocharged engine adds $2,000 to the Forte Koup, or $1,200 in the Forte5.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive Forte is available with three different engines, depending on body style, including one of the most powerful engines in the segment. Each is matched with the same 6-speed automatic transmission, while a 6-speed manual is available as well, again, depending on body style. The Forte’s power advantage requires a small compromise in fuel economy, with the Forte’s numbers trailing many of today’s newer compact cars.

A standard 6-speed manual and available 6-speed automatic do their best to make the most of the 1.8-liter’s 148 horsepower, but with a new 173-horsepower 2.0-liter now offered in some trims, the Elantra doesn’t have to remain at the back of the performance pack any longer. The 3-mode driver-selectable steering, standard in the GT, SE and Limited, greatly improves feedback, while the GT and Elantra Coupe benefit from tighter suspension settings that allow the car to move aggressively over twisting roads. In everyday driving, the cabin is well-insulated from wind and road noise, and the front seats are comfortable for this class of car.
Interior ComfortTechnically, the 2014 Hyundai Elantra’s interior is roomy enough to be classified as a midsize car by the EPA. The cabin is comfortable and features some soft-touch materials, but also uses some rather low-end plastics on the doors and switches. The front seats are well-bolstered. Rear legroom is adequate in the sedan and Coupe, and generous in the GT. Trunk space is laudable, and the folding rear seats in the sedan and Coupe are convenient when hauling bigger items. The GT, meanwhile, features rear seats that fold flat and is a smart pick for those who regularly haul extra gear but don’t want an SUV.
Exterior StylingHyundai calls it “Fluidic Sculpture.” We just call it good-looking. The Elantra continues to evolve Hyundai’s design theme that is meant to evoke “fluid in motion.” For the sheet metal that means lots of curves, a prominent beltline along the sides and headlights that appear as if they are being drawn back into the hood. It all works without feeling gaudy. Aside from having only two doors, Coupe versions are distinguished by a large, trapezoidal mouth and twin tailpipes in the rear. The GT hatchback receives a similar treatment up front and a sloping roof that looks rather fashionable.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER SELECTABLE STEERING MODEHyundai’s first application of a variable steering setup, the Driver Selectable Steering Mode (DSSM) allows the driver to choose from three settings: Comfort, Normal and Sport. DSSM is available on the GT hatchback and the SE and Limited sedans, but, oddly, not the Sport.
HEATED REAR SEATSStandard on the Limited sedan, the Elantra’s rear-seat heating is the kind of creature comfort that would cost extra even in a luxury car. It is almost unheard of in this segment, and just one more way Hyundai is turning up the heat on the competition.
Standard FeaturesEven the base, manual-transmission-equipped SE trim features air conditioning, 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, cruise control and telescoping steering wheel. Elantras also come with remote keyless entry, 4-wheel disc brakes, Bluetooth wireless connectivity and a 172-watt 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/satellite radio with USB/iPod inputs. Coupe and GT models feature heated front seats and GT models come standard with a glove compartment that can be chilled. Coupe and sedan models have six airbags, while Elantra GT versions add a seventh for the driver’s knees.
Factory OptionsUpgrading an Elantra sedan to the Limited trim model adds a power sunroof, leather seating and heated front and rear seats. In Coupe form, the Elantra adds a sport-tuned suspension plus an automatic transmission and can be outfitted with a power sunroof and leather seating. A Tech Package includes a 7-inch screen, rear backup camera, navigation and 360-watt audio system as well as Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics. To get the Tech Package on the GT requires the Style Package that includes a panoramic sunroof and leather seating.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Hyundai Elantra SE and Limited are powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 148 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. The engine gives the Elantra average acceleration and decent passing power. Transmission choices are a good-feeling 6-speed manual (sedan and GT only) or a very smooth 6-speed automatic that is eager to shift and feels well-matched to the engine. Automatic-transmission versions of the 2014 Elantra come with Hyundai’s manual-shifting mode, called Shiftronic, which lets drivers toggle through the gears if desired. More desirable is the new 2.0-liter GDI 4-cylinder that bumps horsepower to 173 and torque to 154 lb-ft. Standard on the Sport, Coupe and GT, this engine offers more robust performance without sacrificing much in the way of fuel economy.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Elantra sedan gets a slight exterior makeover and a new Sport trim. A new 2.0-liter engine replaces the 1.8-liter in the GT, Elantra Coupe and Sport sedan. Other changes include revised wheels, updated navigation radio with Pandora app, Hill Start Assist and Driver Selectable Steering made standard on some trims. The GLS sedan trim is renamed SE, while the Coupe is reduced to a single trim.
Given a slight facelift this year, the 2014 Hyundai Elantra continues to wow consumers and critics alike, providing a nearly unbeatable combination of power, fuel economy, interior room, features, and warranty. Long gone are the days when Hyundai cars were seen as cheap, disposable transportation. With quality ratings and resale values good enough to rival the best competitors, the Elantra is a real threat to compacts like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Ford Focus. Although Hyundai did have to walk back its 40-mpg claim from last year, 38 mpg is still nothing to sneeze at, and none of the Elantra’s rivals can match its 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.

A fully loaded EX-L sedan with navigation comes in at a very respectable $25,030.

Be sure to check our Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page to see what others in your area are actually paying for the 2014 Honda Civic. Down the road, we expect the 2014 Honda Civic to maintain the strongest 5-year residual values in the segment.
Driving the Used 2014 Honda CivicAlthough it’s classified as a compact economy car, the 2014 Honda Civic is a surprisingly adept performer, capable of hugging the asphalt with all the grip one would expect of an agile sports car. Credit goes to the next-generation ACE II body structure that adds strength while reducing weight. The Civic’s steering feel is spot-on, nicely weighted and never loose or vague. We love Honda’s manual setup as well, with its effortless clutch and tight gearbox – one drive will make you think twice before inevitably checking the CVT automatic box. Most impressive is the Civic’s civilized ride and quiet cabin, two attributes usually sacrificed in the name of improved performance. The Civic is one of those rare cars that actually feels like a part of you when driving; its overall driving dynamics is a key reason we consider it one of the best small-car buys today.
Interior ComfortWhile its unusual dash layout might not convey the more upscale ambiance of new and newly relevant nameplates like the Hyundai Elantra, Ford Focus and Chevy Cruze, the 2014 Honda Civic continues to be one of the best compact cars in terms of interior space, storage and outward visibility. Its ergonomics is nearly flawless, and most of the controls are a cinch to operate. Soft-touch materials on the instrument panel and upper door trim replace the bland look and hard plastics that gave the previous cabin a low-budget feel.
Exterior StylingAfter completely remaking the sedan’s exterior last year, the Honda design team focused its attention for 2014 on the coupe, giving it all-new front and rear styling. The new look is defined by a taller trunk lid, larger fog-light bezels and a new grille with a wide black grille bar and prominent Honda logo. New wheels accentuate the Civic coupe’s sporty nature. While these modest cosmetic alterations might escape the eye of the casual observer, it’s hard to argue against sticking to a styling strategy that has helped keep the Civic at or near the top of the sales charts for many years running.
Favorite FeaturesLANEWATCH BLIND-SPOT DISPLAYStandard in the EX and EX-L, this blind-spot warning system employs a tiny camera on the passenger-side mirror that activates when the turn signal is engaged. An image of the right lane is projected onto the display screen, revealing an area four times larger than is covered by the side mirror.
7-INCH DISPLAY AUDIOHonda has been playing catch-up when it comes to in-car infotainment, but with its new Display Audio touch screen, that gap is now gone. The new system can be paired with an iPhone via Siri Eyes, deliver news, social media and apps connection with HondaLink, and access Pandora, SMS texting and HD digital traffic alerts (when equipped with Navigation).
Standard FeaturesEvery 2014 Honda Civic includes a 5-inch full-color multi-information display, rearview camera with guidelines, Bluetooth, integrated Pandora Internet radio, and a USB port. Opting for the mid-tier EX trim nets a power moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, blind-spot monitor, keyless entry with push-button start and automatic climate control, while the range-topping EX-L includes such niceties as leather upholstery, heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The Civic’s wide array of active and passive safety features is included as standard issue across the line. Civic Hybrid variants up the ante with a Forward Collision Warning system.
Factory OptionsOptional features for the 2014 Honda Civic are acquired by stepping up to higher trim levels. Among the most prominent features are a touch-screen navigation system with FM traffic information, auto-on/off headlights, a multi-angle rearview camera, and a 160-watt, 6-speaker premium audio system.
Engine & TransmissionWith no direct injection or turbocharging and only 143 horsepower the 2014 Honda Civic has one of the simplest powertrains of the newest compact sedans. It does, however, gain a new CVT automatic (replacing last year’s 5-speed unit) giving it exceptional fuel economy and plenty of power. The mileage-maxing HF trim features the same powertrain, but adds two highway miles per gallon with a lower ride height, aerodynamic body pieces and low-rolling-resistance tires. The Civic Si, in sedan and coupe form, delivers 205 horsepower through a 6-speed manual transmission.

A new touch-screen display audio system with Apple’s Siri Eyes Free mode is available, but only for EX and higher trims. Also new for 2014: a CVT automatic transmission, LaneWatch blind-spot display, SmartEntry with push-button start, and a slight boost in horsepower for the performance-oriented Si models.
After a spate of makeovers and upgrades last year, Honda continues to improve the Civic by making the coupe a bit sportier, and improving fuel economy with the addition of a new continuously variable transmission (CVT). Where the Civic’s dominance of the small-car field was once unquestioned, it now faces formidable competition from the likes of the Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra, Chevrolet Cruze and Toyota Corolla.

Comparisons of ultimate performance numbers favor the Mustang and Camaro, but if you’re not enchanted with muscle cars and their stomping engines and cramped interiors, you really ought to be looking at something else.",26500,"Driving the Used 2014 Dodge ChallengerWhatever you thought or remembered about the way those muscle cars of times past drove, forget it, because the 2014 Dodge Challenger is a completely new and far, far better driving experience. Even the base model has a V6 of 305 horsepower. The 5.7-liter Hemi V8 churns 375 horsepower with the manual transmission, and the monstrous 6.4-liter SRT8 goes to 470. The fully-independent suspension gives a level of handling that would have been unimaginable in those old days. The Challenger delivers a nice ride on city streets yet, in the hands of a skilled driver, can attack corners with a rampaging gusto. And, make no mistake: With this potential level of performance, a fairly high level of skill will be required to get the most out of it and, even then, such activities are best suited to track days. This is one capable, and impressive, muscle car for the new age.
Interior ComfortIf the 2014 Dodge Challenger is a terrific representation of muscle-car glory on the outside, it’s sort of merely adequate inside. The layout seems uninspired. There are hard plastics, so-so color choices, only-average textures, moderately-adequate details, a lot of ho-hum. But the seats are wide and firm, with sufficient side bolsters and adjustable lumbar support. Two adults can actually fit in the rear, although getting there requires a bit of gymnastics. The Challenger also provides, surprisingly, a fairly generous trunk.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Challenger is longer, higher and altogether larger than the old version. Park the old and the new side-by-side, and the differences become clear. Still, there’s no mistaking the family line, with the long hood, short rear deck and retro styling cues. Of all the current muscle cars, the Challenger seems most related to its ancestor, visually, and that resemblance to its past lends a flavor that tends to show up with classic cars: You drive them not so much to another place but in another time, and so it is with the Challenger. And that’s a good thing.
Favorite Features18-SPEAKER HARMAN/KARDON AUDIO SYSTEMWith 900 watts of audio blasting through 18 – yes, eighteen – speakers, this upgrade makes the Challenger sound better than many home-theater systems.
HEMI ENGINEPardon us if we just can’t resist, but there is an undeniable attraction in knowing that, under the long hood, there sits a Hemi V8 just waiting to get with the program.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Dodge Challenger line goes from the base SXT to the loaded SRT8. The base SXT model includes keyless entry, 18-inch all-season performance tires, automatic climate control, remote start and 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary input and Chrysler’s Uconnect hands-free communication system. The R/T model has the 5.7-liter Hemi V8, an upgraded sound system with Boston speakers, fog lights and a rear spoiler. With the SRT8 model, you’ll get the biggest engine available and a 1-day “Track Experience” where you can learn how to better control your car’s performance. We like the SRT8, and we heartily recommend the Track Experience.
Factory OptionsNumerous upgrades are available for the 2014 Challenger individually or as parts of packages, depending upon trim level. Among the highlights are high-intensity headlights, sunroof, 18-speaker harman/kardon sound system, track suspension, navigation system, 20-inch wheels and various appearance packages to make the Challenger appear even bolder.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Dodge Challenger is available with a choice of three engines: The base 3.6-liter V6 makes 305 horsepower and is all you really need, with loads of performance for the open road or canyon curves. The 5.7-liter Hemi V8, with 375 horsepower with the manual transmission, is plenty more than enough. Beyond that is the 6.4-liter SRT8 Hemi, with 470 horsepower and the ability to melt tires and gas-station credit cards. With an EPA highway rating of 27 mpg and plenty of responsive performance, the V6 is the prudent choice but, if you’re being prudent, you probably aren’t considering a Challenger in the first place.

For all those who missed the muscle cars the first time around, they’re back, the 2014 Dodge Challenger is right there with the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro and they’re all far better than their ancestors. In the intervening decades, technology has made huge leaps, and the 2014 Challenger, as with the Mustang and Camaro, is better in every way: It’s far quicker, handles far better, rides far better, and has far better brakes. It’s also far more efficient and far more reliable. The higher-performance versions of the Mustang and Camaro are probably slightly faster on the track, but the Challenger has more interior room, has looks closer to the original, and has something the others don’t: Available Hemi V8 power.

Smaller, more maneuverable alternatives are the Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma.",25085,"Driving the Used 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew CabThe 2014 GMC Sierra is a truck ready for work and play, with the power and creature comforts ably doing their part in both respects. In our test-drive of a Sierra with the new 5.3-liter V8 engine, it felt capable in nearly every situation. On the highway, the Sierra is surprisingly quiet. Most road imperfections are absorbed well by the truck’s suspension, though we were reminded of its rugged body-on-frame construction during one particularly bad stretch of the 405 freeway in Los Angeles. There, the Sierra bucked like a bronco, and it would not be our choice if driven daily on that type of road. Towing ability is a strong point. We had no problem hauling a 5,000-pound Airstream trailer up steep grades with the 5.3-liter engine, and appreciated that the available trailer brake controller is within easy reach of the steering wheel. The telematics system gets a solid B grade, but the rear-view camera could be higher resolution (especially if you routinely hitch up), and audio functions could respond faster.
Interior ComfortWith big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, the Sierra’s roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be as luxurious as your checkbook is large, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers’ devices. Cab configurations include regular with a bench seat for up three passengers, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.
Exterior StylingGMC has wisely taken an evolutionary approach to the 2014 Sierra’s freshened exterior. We’ll dub it ""contemporary macho."" Like previous models, this full-size truck features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck truck proud. With the new styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5 feet, 8 inches to 8 feet. Double-cab models now have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.
Favorite FeaturesCONNECTED INFOTAINMENTThe Sierra’s available technology gives new meaning to ""work truck."" Higher trims include the IntelliLink touch-screen system to operate navigation, audio and more. We were equally impressed by its five (5!) USB inputs and an AC outlet that can keep a bounty of devices juiced and ready to play.
DRIVER ALERT SEATThis optional but important safety feature works with the Sierra’s lane-departure and forward-collision warning systems by vibrating the seat to alert the driver of potential danger. Ingeniously, it can vibrate each side independently. If you drift to the left, for example, the left side of the seat vibrates.
Standard FeaturesThe most basic 2014 Sierra is still pretty much that and includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats, and an AM/FM radio with a 4.2-inch color display and USB/SD inputs, but no CD player, Bluetooth, or telescoping steering wheel. Step up to an SLE trim and you’ll get a rear-vision camera, 6-speaker audio and 17-inch wheels made of premium aluminum instead of steel. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen command center, power-adjustable pedals, and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali’s 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio system, and leather-clad front bucket seats.
Factory OptionsAdd-ons are available across the entire 2014 Sierra lineup to make it more functional and comfortable. All Sierras can be equipped with 4-wheel drive instead of the standard rear-wheel drive. Those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Other options of note include the Driver Alert Package with lane-departure warning and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package includes an off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof, and a rear-seat entertainment system.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices are available on the 2014 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8, or the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. All are linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission and have laudable towing capacity, including the V6’s max of 7,200 pounds. On the other end is the 6.2-liter V8 that can pull up to 12,000 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,500 pounds and a highway rating of 22 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC’s new engine lineup and offers a good balance of power and efficiency. All the engines use technology such as direct injection and Active Fuel Management, which allows them to run on fewer cylinders and thus use less fuel. The engines can run on regular unleaded gasoline or E85.

Like its near-twin the Chevrolet Silverado, the slightly more upscale GMC Sierra arrives in fresh form for 2014 with more power and a well-designed interior blessed with the latest tech and safety features. The 2014 Sierra still spans a variety of trims and configurations to appeal to a broad range of pickup buyers, from a rather basic work truck to the leather-laden Sierra Denali. All benefit from new V6 and V8 engines that can pull more than their predecessors yet travel a bit farther on a gallon of gas. While it’s no secret that brand loyalty is a key buying factor in a segment that includes the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra, the Sierra distinguishes itself from rivals with surprising creature comforts and potent powertrains.

The larger Wrangler Unlimited 4-door version is some $3,800 more, and a fully-loaded Sahara or Rubicon can easily exceed $40,000. If you want your Jeep to look WWII-retro, the Willys Wheeler variants add about $3,000 to the price of a Wrangler Sport or Wrangler Sport S. Wranglers enjoy historically high resale values, with 3-year-old examples projected to return almost 60 percent of their original window sticker. Should you consider a Wrangler for aggressive off-roading, a fully-loaded top-of-the-line Rubicon, even with a window sticker around $40,000, is an absolute steal when compared to the cost of upgrading a more standard Wrangler by way of the 4WD aftermarket. To make your best deal, be sure to check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area typically pay for a Jeep Wrangler.
Driving the Used 2014 Jeep WranglerOnce a Jeep, always a Jeep, and the 2014 Wrangler SUV remains true to why people buy them – body-on-frame construction, front and rear live axles, generous ground clearance, minimal overhangs, and a distinctive look that can be traced back for almost three-quarters of a century keep the customers coming. Even though this layout is heavily skewed to off-road use, driving it on paved surfaces is far better than might initially be expected. The suspension deals with pavement irregularities as well as it deals with off-road bumps and ruts, and the precise steering is as welcome off-pavement as on. Get away from the smooth and hard surfaces and the Wrangler is everything expected, capable of dealing with incredible landscapes and even crawling along at a walking pace. And, with the Pentastar V6, the Wrangler has its best engine ever, with plenty of power for the ups and downs.
Interior ComfortChoose the base Sport model and the 2014 Wrangler’s interior will have cloth seats and a look and feel that can be described as functional. Move up through the trim levels and you will eventually get to such alternatives as a Sahara Unlimited with 2-tone leather and the touch of, if not outright luxury, at least plush comfort. In back, the rear seat folds flat to create a generous, handy and flat load space that’s perfect for all the gear that off-roading sometimes requires.
Exterior StylingThough the Wrangler has grown over time from the original Jeep, the family resemblance is unmistakable. The boxy shape (originally for ease and low-cost in war-time manufacturing) remains, with its no-nonsense form. The big upright windshield provides excellent visibility of the terrain, and the extremely short overhangs allow unmatched approach and departure angles. So, over the decades the size has grown and the weight has increased, but it’s still distinctly a Jeep and has even more off-road capability than any Wranglers that have preceded it. Select trims boast their own flair, from the gloss black touches of the retro Willys Wheeler (based on the Wrangler Sport model) and Willys Wheeler W (based on the Sport S), to the power-dome hood on the Polar variant.
Favorite Features3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6The Pentastar V6 gives the Jeep Wrangler ample power, smooth operation, nice response and commendable highway fuel economy; It’s just about as perfectly suited as it can be. And if you equip the Wrangler with the available 5-speed automatic, you’ll enjoy enhanced refinement without giving up hardly any capability or efficiency.
COMMANDING OFF-ROAD CAPABILITYWhy else buy a Wrangler but for its capability to go far beyond the end of pavement? It may sound worn-out or obvious, but the Wrangler SUV really is very, very good at this, and its off-road prowess remains, after decades, the primary reason for buying one in the first place.
Standard FeaturesAmong the most valuable items of standard equipment is the 3.6-liter V6 engine and its 285 horsepower and ample torque. But it’s more than just the terrific engine. Standard electronic stability control, electronic roll mitigation, Hill-Start Assist and Trailer Sway Control will be welcome by all drivers. Most important is the Wrangler SUV’s awesome capability for dealing with life without pavement, and it’s included as standard equipment. Compromises come in regards to conveniences, especially in base models, which lack power windows, power doorlocks and even air conditioning as standard equipment.
Factory OptionsThe 2014 Jeep Wrangler is one of a very short list of vehicles that gives buyers a choice of final-drive ratios. Generally speaking, a lower-number axle ratio offers better fuel economy and lower engine rpm for a quieter ride, while a higher number enables better acceleration, as well as climbing and towing ability. Most of the extras are wrapped into trim levels, but other options include the Freedom III Package, the 32-inch Tire and Wheel Group, a Connectivity Group, Power Convenience Group, Premium Appearance Group, Rubicon X Package, Trail Kit and Trailer-Tow Package. There is also a variety of electronic conveniences and sound-system upgrades.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Jeep Wrangler is powered by a terrific 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 of 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque in a smooth delivery that makes easy work of highways or rock crawls. This is certainly the best engine ever in a Wrangler. It can be fitted with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission and, in the 2-door Wrangler, there is no difference in fuel economy between the two transmission choices.

A Trail Kit includes a tow strap, D-rings, gloves and a carrying bag, and the Sport is available with 32-inch tires.
After decades of development and history, the 2014 Jeep Wrangler SUV remains faithfully true to its hard-earned and thoroughly-deserved reputation as the universal standard for off-road vehicles. The Jeep Wrangler line offers something for everybody, from a basic 2-door Sport with a soft top, to the go-where-the-trails-aren’t Rubicon. If you need more room the longer Wrangler Unlimited offers four doors and other features, but with the same level of off-road prowess. The engine is Chrysler’s highly-commendable 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, which delivers plenty of power and noteworthy fuel economy, and the Wrangler is also one of the few remaining vehicles that’s available with a manual transmission. That’s why we named it one of the 10 Best SUVs Under"

Thanks to an alluring new array of in-vehicle electronics, the Grand Cherokee is also one of the most technologically advanced entrants in the category.","ConsAll-terrain bragging rights aside, most of today’s SUVs never venture off the pavement. That’s why staunch urbanites might prefer the low cabin noise and superior ride comfort offered by the Volkswagen Touareg. Additionally, families in need of a 7-8 passenger carryall should look to the Nissan Pathfinder or Honda Pilot.",30000,"Driving the Used 2014 Jeep Grand CherokeeThe highway ride – where we predict the 2014 Grand Cherokee will spend the bulk of its service – is surprisingly resilient and far more composed than its rugged demeanor suggests. The electric-assisted steering is light during low-speed maneuvers, yet weights up appropriately at speed. While there, however, the Jeep Grand Cherokee’s large, square mirrors and boxy shape create noticeable wind noise. When the asphalt ends, the 2014 Grand Cherokee impresses with its ample ground clearance, abundance of traction, and innovative off-road tech. As for power, all three engine choices are highly-competitive in terms of performance and fuel efficiency. But despite our affection for diesel technology, the new EcoDiesel’s $4,500 premium combined with pricey urea exhaust fluid refills every 10,000 miles makes it a tough pill to swallow. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the 470-horsepower 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT proves that utility and eye-popping performance can indeed go hand in hand. And while a rather stiff ride limits its appeal as a daily-driver, most drivers will find the SRT’s compelling driving dynamics worth the sacrifice in ride comfort.
Interior ComfortContemporary and functional, the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s cabin is a well-finished space with accommodations for up to five adult-sized passengers. Soft-touch surfaces are plentiful, accented by tasteful wood trims. The optional UConnect system is easy to operate, though we appreciate the fact that Jeep provides an accompanying collection of redundant physical controls for technophobes. Regarding storage, the Jeep Grand Cherokee can swallow 68.7 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seats folded, while offering 35.1 cubes with the seats upright (both figures are on par with the Ford Edge and VW Touareg, but considerably less than Toyota’s 4Runner).
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Grand Cherokee projects modernism and sophistication while at the same time conveying Jeep’s distinguished off-road theme. The signature 7-slot grille, front bumper cover, and headlights have been reshaped for a more cohesive look. Higher-end Grand Cherokee models feature extra helpings of chrome along with new front and rear LED light pipes. Although its traditional SUV profile affords a high seating position for a more comprehensive view of the road, the step-in height remains relatively low, making it convenient for the vertically-challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended. Thus, if you’re of short stature, we recommend opting for the power-operated liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesUCONNECT ACCESSArguably the most intuitive infotainment system available, UConnect Access offers cutting-edge connected car technology in a format that doesn’t require an engineering degree to operate. Via the 8.4-inch touch panel or voice-recognition, users of all skill levels can access innovative features like UConnect mobile apps (Bing Local Search, Pandora and more), 3D navigation maps, and hands-free text messages (not compatible with iPhone).
QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSIONComplementing the Grand Cherokee’s trio of 4-wheel-drive (4WD) systems, the optional Quadra-Lift air suspension provides Jeep owners with five selectable vehicle height settings. When fully raised, the system creates a lofty 10.6 inches of ground clearance, which bests even the Wrangler Rubicon. The system can also be lowered, improving aerodynamics as well as facilitating ingress and egress.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee comes in four trims: Laredo, Limited, Overland and Summit. Entry-level Laredo models feature dual-zone climate control, a digital instrument cluster, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 6-speaker audio system with a 5-inch touch screen. The volume-leading Limited grade adds larger 18-inch wheels, leather and heated front seats, while a panoramic moonroof, UConnect Access infotainment, and xenon headlights come as standard issue on Overland models. At $49,000, the Grand Cherokee Summit is crammed with virtually every high-end feature on the menu. Standard safety features for all models includes six airbags, a raft of stability control systems, and UConnect emergency assistance with a complimentary trial subscription.
Factory OptionsQuadra-Lift air suspension coupled with the top-spec Quadra-Drive II 4-wheel-drive system are essential for any hardcore off-road enthusiast. Family-minded buyers looking to keep their backseat youngsters occupied will appreciate the Blu-ray entertainment center. As a bonus, the system is compatible with most gaming consoles. Because visibility with the standard halogen headlights is middling at best, drivers who frequently travel at night should consider the optional xenon setup. Finally, in a true sign of the times, a CD player has been relegated to the options list for 2014.
Engine & TransmissionEngine choices include a standard 3.6-liter V6, 5.7-liter Hemi V8, and a new 3.0-liter diesel V6. The sole engine offering in the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT is a monstrous 6.4-liter V8 that pushes a whopping 470-horsepower to all four wheels through a rear-biased 4WD system. For non-SRT models, rear-wheel drive is standard across the board, with three 4-wheel-drive systems optional. Every 2014 Grand Cherokee, including the SRT variant, is fitted with a new 8-speed automatic transmission. As a result, the complete lineup of 2014 Grand Cherokee models sees modest improvements in acceleration and fuel economy. Furthermore, V6 towing capacity has been increased from 5,000 to 6,200 pounds.

Also new to the roster is a premium Summit model grade, refreshed interior colors, and a Forward Collision Warning system that alerts the driver to potential collisions.
Just a few years following its triumphant return to glory in the U.S. marketplace, the Jeep Grand Cherokee goes under the knife once again in an effort to maintain a competitive standing among segment standouts like the Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, and Volkswagen Touareg. Given that its framework is shared in large part with the latest Mercedes-Benz M-Class, the Grand Cherokee looks and feels remarkably upscale for a mainstream SUV. And unlike many of its domesticated challengers, Jeep engineers managed to improve the on-road manners of the 4th-generation Grand Cherokee without sacrificing off-road capability. At the top of the Grand Cherokee ladder is the equally-new Grand Cherokee SRT, which delivers a level of performance rivaling that of the road-burning BMW X5 M and Porsche Cayenne GTS for thousands less.

What's New?For 2014, the Nissan Maxima SV gains a rearview monitor, a USB port and a 7-inch color display. A new S Value Package adds smoked-lens HID headlights, 18-inch Dark Hyper Silver aluminum-alloy wheels, a rear spoiler and fog lights.
As Nissan’s flagship sedan, the 2014 Maxima has long held a special position in the fleet. Although not quite Infiniti-like in its luxury offerings, the Maxima is a cut above the bread-and-butter sedans from Honda and Toyota. Many owners consider the Maxima to be a performance sedan on par with Audi and BMW sedans, but for far less money. A powerful V6 engine, impressive cornering and braking ability, and a feature-laden interior place the Maxima in the same league as the Chrysler 300, Volkswagen CC and Hyundai Azera. However, the Maxima’s biggest competition may come from inside Nissan itself. Less expensive than the Maxima, the new Altima offers more interior room, better fuel economy and nearly the same level of performance.
Used 2014 Nissan Maxima PricingThe 2014 Nissan Maxima S has a base Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $32,000. Load up a top-level Maxima SV and you’re looking at around $40,000. At its base price, the Maxima costs more than the Dodge Charger, Kia Optima SX, and Buick Regal Turbo. It is about the same as a Hyundai Azera and Chrysler 300 and less than base Ford Taurus SHO and V6-equipped VW CC. The 2014 Maxima is priced higher than a V6-equipped 2014 Altima 3.5 S, which starts just over $27,000. Be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are actually paying for the 2014 Nissan Maxima. We expect the Maxima’s resale value to be marginal at best.
Driving the Used 2014 Nissan MaximaThe Maxima has always been touted as the “4-door sports car,” and for all intents and purposes the 2014 Nissan Maxima delivers on this promise. The Maxima’s 290-horsepower V6 engine provides an abundance of power and a lovely low growl that brings a smile to our face every time we hear it. Nissan has done a masterful job with the Maxima’s suspension, tuning it to be responsive in tight turns, yet still compliant over surface streets and highway pavement. If there is one area of contention it can be found nestled between the Maxima’s engine and front wheels. Although Nissan’s CVT automatic is arguably one of the best CVTs in the industry, it just doesn’t work for us in this car. Even with the optional paddle shifters, we yearned for the feel of a manual like the one used in the 370Z.
Interior ComfortFrom the premium leather seats that are standard on SV versions, to its thick steering wheel, the 2014 Nissan Maxima’s interior seems to scream, “Let’s go driving!” Standard on the higher-trim SV model is a sleek infotainment system with a 7-inch color screen and visually appealing buttons and dials that are just as at home in vehicles from Nissan’s Infiniti luxury division. For passengers in back, there is adequate but not great headroom and legroom, and the 2014 Maxima’s hollowed-out rear seatbacks don’t offer the kind of firm lumbar support found in the front seats. The rear seats fold for expanded cargo room.
Exterior StylingDefining the Maxima’s styling as “liquid motion,” Nissan incorporates coupe-like design cues into a mid-size sedan body. Look closely and you can see traces of the Nissan 370Z sports coupe in the 2014 Maxima, especially in the headlights and taillights. That liquid mantra carries onto the sleek hood and bulging front fenders, and carries aft where the sloping roof meets a sculpted rear end. Seen from the side, the Maxima appears in motion even when still thanks to an athletic stance. Twin tailpipes further send the message of this car’s potency.
Favorite FeaturesHEATED STEERING WHEELIf you’ve ever suffered shivering fingers after seeking refuge from the cold, there’s nothing quite like wrapping your hands around a warm steering wheel. The 2014 Maxima offers this feature among its package options along with the also-appreciated heated front seats.
VELVETY ENGINEThe Maxima’s standard 3.5-liter V6 is strong and smooth. In this flagship vehicle, it has been tweaked to be the most potent of any Nissan sedan: 290 horsepower.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Nissan Maxima is available in two trims, S and SV, with the SV also available with Sport and Premium packages. A base Maxima S comes with a power moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming inside mirror, pushbutton ignition, an 8-way power driver’s seat, cloth interior, and an 8-speaker audio system with AM/FM/in-dash 6-CD changer and auxiliary input. SV models add leather seats, fog lights, rearview monitor, USB port, 7-inch color display and a Homelink remote transceiver. Both trims come standard with 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsMany options in the 2014 Nissan Maxima are bundled in packages. They include a Bose premium sound system, navigation system, wood trim, heated and ventilated driver’s seat, a rear-window sunshade, 19-inch wheels, and a dual-panel moonroof. For those seeking the best cornering performance, the Sport package offers a specially tuned suspension and trunk chassis reinforcement. An external ground lighting kit can literally make your Maxima glow. Unlike the less-costly Nissan Altima, safety technologies such as blind-spot monitor and lane-departure warning are not available in the 2014 Maxima.
Engine & TransmissionThe standard engine in the 2014 Nissan Maxima is a 3.5-liter V6 that makes an impressive 290 horsepower, more than enough power to make this front-wheel-drive sedan scoot. Its sole transmission is a continuously variable automatic. The recommended fuel for the Nissan Maxima is premium unleaded.

Engine output of 109 horsepower is low even in this subcompact class. Check out the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit or Chevrolet Sonic.",15650,"OK, so what’s next?I’m interested in the newest version of this car. What’s for sale near me?I’m interested in this car, and I’d like to trade in my current car while I’m at it.Then again, maybe I should be thinking about a used car.
Driving the Used 2019 Nissan Versa NoteYes, the 2019 Versa Note is short on thrills, but at least it’s easy to drive, with light steering, excellent outward vision and compact dimensions making easy work of parking. The engine sounds a bit grainy at high revs, and there’s no real joy other than fuel economy to be had from the continually variable transmission (CVT). Ride quality is on the soft side, which is fine for rough surfaces on straight roads, but the car leans over through the curves, while the steering lacks any kind of feel for what the front wheels are doing. It soon becomes apparent, though, that they will not like to be pushed at all, breaking into understeer and letting the nose run wide at a point when most other cars are still gripping the cornering line, leaving the driver with no other option but to ease off the throttle.
Interior ComfortA shortage of thrills is matched by an absence of frills. It’s pretty basic in here, as the hand-cranked windows illustrate. The plastics are a reminder that the 2019 Versa Note’s retail price is comparatively low. There’s only one interior color: Charcoal. However, everything is put together well. Finding the ideal driving position is easy, there’s 40.8 inches of front headroom and an adult-friendly 37 inches of rear legroom. Plus the aforementioned cargo area, which expands to 38.3 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded down. This is one of the most spacious cabins in the subcompact-hatchback class.
Exterior StylingWe’ve already put forward the argument that hatchbacks can be more aesthetically pleasing than their sedan siblings. It could quite easily ring true in this case. Short overhangs, sculpted doors and a large rear spoiler above the rear window (on the SR model) convey a fun character. From a purely practical point of view, the tall doors mean easy entry and exit. The wide-opening rear doors, meanwhile, prove their worth when fitting a child seat, and when buckling in or extracting your bundle of Cheerios-covered joy.
Favorite FeaturesLARGE CARGO CAPACITY For a subcompact hatch that’s just 163 inches long, the 2019 Versa Note enjoys 18.8 cubic feet of luggage space behind its rear seats. That’s better than some midsize-crossover SUVs, let alone direct competition like the Honda Fit (16.6), Chevrolet Sonic (14.9) or Ford Fiesta (10.1).
 EASY FILL TIRE ALERT Many of us have scrambled around looking for the correct tire-pressure information. With the 2019 Versa Note, we just attach the air line to the valve and this highly convenient feature (optional in SV trim, standard in the SR) first flashes the hazard lights to indicate it’s working, then beeps the horn once there’s sufficient inflation.
Standard FeaturesYou know things are bleak when you look at the list of standard equipment and the manufacturer mentions something that really ought to go without saying, like a speedometer. As well as the aforementioned wind-up windows, the extremely sparse S model has 15-inch steel wheels — but no power locks, driver’s-seat height adjustment, cruise control, or even a remote trunk release. And whereas most cars have brake discs at both ends, the Versa Note puts drums at the back. But it does have air conditioning, Bluetooth, a 4-speaker audio system, and active grille shutters for optimum aerodynamic/fuel efficiency. Luckily, the 2019 Versa Note is cheap enough to consider going up to the next SV level, which has a few more amenities and is eligible for some options.
Factory OptionsThe SV provides power windows/locks and cruise control. As mentioned in the “What’s New” section, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto joins this trim, which is also eligible for the SV Special Edition package that includes 15-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/ignition, fog lights and the Easy Fill Tire Alert feature. The range-topping SR trim level has that package’s contents as standard, but goes with 16-inch alloy wheels. The cloth interior is also enlivened by an orange stripe on each seat. Other options include premium paint, frameless self-dimming rearview mirror with universal garage-door opener, and a Rockford Fosgate audio system upgrade.
Engine & TransmissionThis might sound odd, but there’s a downside to achieving 39 mpg on the highway. Such impressive fuel economy is the result of unimpressive muscle: 109 horsepower from a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine bolted to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) tuned for frugality rather than fun. Let’s not bother with zero-to-60-mph times or top speeds; let’s just say the front-drive-only 2019 Versa Note eventually becomes quick enough to keep up with the general freeway flow, which isn’t really an issue during the rush hours anyway.
 1.6-liter inline-4 109 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 107 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: 31/39 mpg
Read Full Review","What's New?After some additions late in the 2018 model year (rearview camera and 7-inch infotainment touch screen), the only tweak for the 2019 Versa Note is the inclusion of Nissan Connect for the uppermost SV and SR trims, bringing remote services, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, and satellite radio.
The 2019 Nissan Versa Note is the hatchback version of the Versa subcompact sedan. It’s long been the accepted wisdom that Americans prefer sedans to hatchbacks, while other parts of the world favor the latter over the former. Admittedly, having a lockable trunklid keeps valuables safely out of sight and out of reach. But how often do we leave valuables in the car compared with how often we need cargo/passenger versatility? And although this next point is purely subjective, hatchbacks tend to look less awkward than their sedan counterparts. The Versa Note is no sports machine, but it is relatively spacious, cheap to buy and economical to run. It could work well for first-time buyers, small families and commuters looking to keep expenses low.

What's New?The big news is the all-new Versa Note 5-door that can be had as a no-frills transport car, but also is offered with a wide variety of features…if you’re ready to pay for them. All 2014 Nissan Versa Sedans benefit from revised suspension and steering calibrations. Entry-level S models get a tachometer and SV and SL models have improved seat-cushion design. The SV also includes a 60/40 split-folding rear seat and the top-line SL gets a 4.3-inch display audio package and 16-inch alloy wheels.
For 2014, the Nissan Versa offers a schizophrenic aspect. The sedan version is uninspiring but best-selling older tech, while the 5-door hatchback offers new tech and a wider array of features. The 2014 Versa Sedan claims to be the roomiest car in its class, and it remains the least-expensive new car you can buy with its $12,780 starting price unchanged from last year. Add in fuel economy of up to 40 mpg, and the Versa looks even more sensible. Little is changed this year on the Sedan versions other than chassis tuning and some equipment offerings, but the all-new and very stylish 5-door hatch is a different story, combining fresh looks with similar fuel economy.
Used 2014 Nissan Versa PricingWith a base price of $12,780 including destination charge (the same as last year), the 2014 Nissan Versa Sedan still claims the title of lowest-priced new car you can buy in this country. The newer Versa Note hatchback has a starting price of $14,780 including destination charge, indicating Nissan’s belief that consumers will pay more for its good looks and greater versatility. As you climb the trim levels and add equipment, the prices also climb commensurately. For example, a top-line Versa Note SL model with the Technology Package has a list price of more than $19,000, which could buy well-equipped examples of competitive models like the Kia Rio, Ford Fiesta, Chevy Sonic, or Honda Fit. Before buying, be sure to check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the various 2014 Nissan Versa models. Over the long-term, the Versa’s resale value is expected to be good, and its 5-Year Cost to Own has traditionally been among the best-in-class.
Driving the Used 2014 Nissan VersaWe haven’t yet had the opportunity to drive the Versa Sedan and Versa Note 5-door back-to-back, but our very educated guess is the new Note amplifies the virtues of the older-design Sedan. Both are smooth and quiet by economy-car standards, and we were impressed with the refinement of the Note in particular. Though its road-going behavior will never be called exciting, the Versa is an easy car to drive and maneuver. The steering is light, its turning radius is tight, and visibility is very good from the driver’s seat. Like other cars with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), Versas so equipped take some getting used to. There are no conventional shift points, so the engine may seem to be working hard at unexpected times, and with just 109 horsepower, the 2014 Versa’s acceleration won’t tempt you to enter many drag races.
Interior ComfortNissan says the Versa Sedan has best-in-class rear legroom, and the trunk has a surprising amount of space, too. With 14.9 cubic feet of capacity, the Versa’s cargo hold is larger than the Nissan Maxima. The Versa Note is equally roomy, and it offers a whopping 21.4 cubic feet of cargo space in a very versatile interior. The Note’s interior is also flashier and more appealing than the so-so interior of the sedan version. It offers niceties like a rear-seat armrest with cupholders, available heated cloth seats and a driver’s armrest. The Note is also the hot tip if you’re a tech fan, offering the Around View Monitor that makes parallel parking a breeze.
Exterior StylingPicture an economy car in your mind, and you’ll likely visualize something akin to the 2014 Nissan Versa Sedan. It is utterly acceptable and that’s it. But the Versa Note kicks it all up a notch with exterior styling that Note product planners cite as a “reason to buy.” We agree. The Note’s overhangs are six inches shorter than the Sedan’s, and the result is a more energetic-looking design. Higher-trim SV and SL models are distinguished by chrome highlights. Wheels are 15- or 16-inch, and steel or aluminum-alloy, depending on the bodystyle, trim and option package.
Favorite FeaturesREAR LEGROOMThe Versa is commendably roomy, and folding rear seatbacks add versatility. In both Sedan and 5-door forms this is a small car that can comfortably seat two full-size adults in back.
FUEL ECONOMYSedans with the CVT automatic transmission are rated at 40 mpg for the highway and 35 mpg combined. The new 5-door equals the Sedan’s numbers with even better drivability, making both Versas easy on the wallet and on the environment.
Standard FeaturesThe Nissan Versa is one of the few new cars that still offers roll-your-own windows and manual-adjust mirrors. But that’s in base ""S"" trim, which is also manual-transmission only. Climbing the food chain, you’ll step up to the costlier SV or SL trims that deliver significantly plusher amenities, yet no version of the 2014 Versa Sedan has a telescoping steering wheel, which can make it harder for drivers to obtain an optimum position. The base S trim includes a tachometer, and the low-rolling-resistance tires that used to come only with the CVT are now standard across the line. Happily, even base vehicles have air conditioning and AM/FM/CD audio with auxiliary input.
Factory OptionsMajor options for the Versa Sedan are available in higher-trim SV and SL models. The Convenience Package in SV models adds Bluetooth, steering-wheel-mounted audio and phone controls and 15-inch alloy wheels. The Technology Package on SL models adds Nissan Connect with Navigation and a color touch screen, satellite radio, rearview monitor, and a USB input for audio playback. Things are a bit different for the Versa Note. It, too, starts in an S trim manual-only version. An S Plus adds CVT transmission and little else, but the SV brings with it a 4.3-inch audio display, rear-view monitor, and the Divide-N-Hide adjustable rear cargo floor. The SL version is filled with niceties like 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, fog lights and heated seats. Going to the SL Tech package adds Nissan Connect with Navigation, Around View Monitor and heated side mirrors.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive Nissan Versa Sedan and 5-door Note hatchback are equipped with a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. With only 109 horsepower, it’s not particularly powerful, but does get an EPA rating of 40 mpg on the highway when connected to a CVT transmission. Other transmission choices are a 5-speed manual (Versa Sedan and Versa Note) and 4-speed automatic (available only on base S models of the Sedan.) All other Versas use the fuel-saving CVT that Nissan is so high on.

The driving position is comfortable and, thanks to the somewhat high profile, the driver has a great view of the road and traffic. Parking and dealing with tight traffic couldn’t be easier, as the excellent visibility and the tidy size make it a snap to zip in and out of snug parking spots or work through crowded streets. Choose the 5-speed manual transmission (available only on the base ES trim level with 2-wheel drive) and you’ll find it light, easy and precise. The continuously-variable automatic transmission includes handy paddle shifters mounted on the steering wheel for manual control. While the Outlander Sport is not intended for enthusiastic attacks on winding roads or for serious off-roading, the All Wheel Control function of the all-wheel-drive versions allows an “auto” mode for enhanced grip in general and “lock” for dealing with slippery conditions.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Outlander Sport’s interior is easy on the eyes and easy to use. Front seats are reasonably comfortable, while the rear is snug for three adults but just fine for two. Behind the rear seat the cargo capacity is not great, at just over 20 cubic feet, but fold down the rear seats and the capacity more than doubles. There is leather on the steering wheel and shift knob, and leather seating is available with the SE Touring Package as an option. The Outlander Sport’s interior doesn’t claim to be luxurious, but it is useful and comfortable.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Outlander Sport’s exterior gives prospective buyers lots of reasons to sign the dotted line. Up front, the nose is remindful of Mitsubishi’s Lancer Evolution performance line, while along the sides are deep creases and sculpturing that bring a lot of interest and neatly tie into the door handles. Big wheels and tires fill up the wheel wells, and the rear end is nicely tied off with wraparound taillights and a spoiler over the rear window. An optionally-available roof rack can be used to carry larger items that won’t fit inside.
Favorite FeaturesROCKFORD FOSGATE AUDIO SYSTEMYou’ll literally feel the music with this 9-speaker, 710-watt sound system that includes a powerful subwoofer. And with a built-in 6-disc CD changer, SiriusXM receiver and available 40-gig hard drive with music server, you’ll never be lacking for tunes.
GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEYIt may seem obvious, but it deserves mention: The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, with a full complement of safety features, exceptional selection of audio systems and other electronic aids, commendable fuel economy, a low price and easy driving and operation, represents a lot of transportation value for the money.
Standard FeaturesEven a base 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES packs a good amount of comfort, safety and convenience features. Among them are leather wrapping the shift knob and the tilt/telescoping steering wheel, LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, air conditioning with pollen filter, steering-wheel-mounted cruise control and audio buttons, a 4-speaker/140-watt AM/FM/CD system, and Fuse voice-control system. SE models add automatic on/off high-intensity headlights, rain-sensing wipers, automatic climate control, heated front seats, and six speakers instead of four along with a touch-screen audio display. Mitsubishi vehicles also come with a new-car warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain.
Factory OptionsMany options for the 2014 Outlander Sport are grouped into packages, including a Premium Package (SE trim), Premium Package with Panoramic Glass Roof (SE trim), Touring Package (SE trim), Exterior Package, Interior Package (with CVT only), and other packages for LED Illumination, LED Daytime Running Lights, Rear Park Assist Sensor, Cargo, All-Weather and Navigation. Stand-alone options include an alloy fuel door, roof rack crossbars, body side moldings, all-weather floormats, fog lights, wheel locks, and mudguards.
Engine & TransmissionJust one engine is available for Outlander Sport models, a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that runs on regular unleaded gasoline and is rated at 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. It is mated to a CVT automatic transmission or, for the base version of the vehicle, a 5-speed manual. While the powertrain is certainly willing, it would be unreasonable to expect large doses of performance. The Outlander Sport uses a “brake energy regeneration” system to reduce fuel usage and CO2 emissions, which works by capturing kinetic energy during deceleration and then intensively recharging the battery with that energy. The battery can then reduce its reliance on the engine’s alternator, which helps conserve fuel. The result is a powertrain that is entirely adequate for the vehicle’s uses and also delivers quite commendable fuel economy.

Read Full Review","What's New?The numerous additions to the Outlander Sport for 2014 include an engine balancer shaft on models with the continuously-variable automatic transmission (CVT), a new steering wheel with audio controls, improved sound insulation, and a variety of upgrades specific to individual trim levels, mainly in the areas of touch-screens, navigation and sound systems.
Intended to compete in the smallest end of the compact SUV market, against the likes of the Nissan Juke and Mini Countryman, the 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport brings style and a fun-to-own image. It drives nice and easy, is small enough to be maneuverable around town, will haul 5-passengers and a reasonable amount of random stuff, gets really good gas mileage, and has a low price. Mitsubishi says it’s the company’s best-selling model, and with good reason – it’s a completely agreeable little SUV.

Its distinctiveness also increases the chance that the valet will park your car out front.","ConsWhile it has plenty of character, the Maserati Quattroporte does not have the same level of cutting edge technology in driver-assist and infotainment systems found in rival German sedans like the Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7-Series or Audi A8.",102500,"Driving the Used 2014 Maserati QuattroporteThe 2014 Maserati Quattroporte is a big car, measuring 207.2 inches overall. And yet, thanks to its potent powertrains, adaptive suspension and finely tuned Brembo brakes, it drives like a much smaller car. As other manufacturers employ electric-assist power steering, Maserati sticks with tried-and-true hydraulic technology, which has terrific feel and response. The driving characteristics of the two Quattroporte sedans – both packing twin-turbocharged engines – are distinct. The V8 rear-drive GTS model offers massive power underfoot and pushes slightly when driven hard. The V6-powered S Q4 is a bit more subtle and balanced thanks to the all-wheel-drive system which delivers all the power to the rear axle under most conditions, but once slip is detected, can shift all the twist to the front, if needed. While this sedan is at home on twisty roads, it really shines as a freeway cruiser with the long wheelbase contributing to a limousine-like ride.
Interior ComfortThe cabin is a sublime blend of leather, wood, chrome and optional carbon-fiber accents. The Maserati Trident is seemingly everywhere, from the middle of the steering wheel to center of the oval analog clock. In addition to analog gauges, the Quattroporte has a 7-inch TFT display in the instrument cluster and an 8.5-inch in-dash touch screen. The car can be fitted with a heated wood steering wheel and the rear seating area can be configured to carry two or three passengers. Perhaps the biggest change is the increase in rear-seat legroom as a result of the longer 124.8-inch wheelbase.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Quattroporte has strong curb appeal in its distinctive design that showcases a ribbed grille dominated by the traditional Maserati Trident logo and the automaker’s signature three chrome portholes on each front fender. Flowing lines accentuate the car’s extended wheelbase and overall length. While there is a significant price difference between the GTS and S Q4, the two cars are indistinguishable except for the badging and exhaust-tip treatments – the V8 GTS has a twin trapezoid design versus the V6 S Q4’s twin round outlets.
Favorite FeaturesSKYHOOK SUSPENSIONUsing magnetic rheological shock absorbers, the Maserati Quattroporte’s ride is both surefooted and supple, giving it the sporty feel of a grand tourer.
SPORT PERFORMANCE MODEOne push of the sport-mode button stiffens up the Quattroporte sedan’s suspension and gives the 8-speed automatic transmission quicker shifts, the main attraction here is the opening of exhaust flaps that normally stay closed until 3,000 rpm. The engine sound alone is worth the price of admission.
Standard FeaturesIn addition to the new twin-turbo engines, the Quattroporte benefits from its smooth shifting 8-speed ZF automatic transmission. All of the sedans are also equipped with the I.C.E. mode (Increased Control and Efficiency) feature that delivers softer throttle response and shifts to increase fuel economy and improve grip in slippery conditions. Other notable standard equipment includes a rearview camera and adaptive cruise control.
Factory OptionsAmong the available options for the new Quattroporte is a 4-passenger configuration that features rear comfort seats separated by a larger leather-covered and wood-trimmed console. This $7,290 option can be complemented with fold-down rear tables ($3,350) and 4-zone climate control ($3,180). Also available is a $5,100 Bower & Wilkins sound system with 15 speakers and an optional rear-seat entertainment system that boasts two 10.2-inch LCD displays attached to the front bucket seats.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Maserati Quattroporte features two all-new twin-turbocharged powerplants, a 3.8-liter V8 in the GTS and a 3.0-liter V6 in the S Q4. Both sedans have the kind of throaty exhaust note and responsive performance that you’d expect from an Italian exotic. While incorporating Maserati engineering and design, both engines are actually manufactured by Ferrari. An 8-speed ZF automatic transmission channels engine power to the rear wheels of the Quattroporte GTS and to all four wheels of the Quattroporte S Q4.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Quattroporte sedan has been completely redesigned on a longer wheelbase and offers more interior and trunk room than the car it replaces. In addition to its stylish new exterior, the Maserati flagship offers – for the first time – twin-turbo V6 power combined with all-wheel drive.
“That’s Italian” is the best way to describe the 2014 Maserati Quattroporte. From its sexy exterior to the throaty exhaust, this 4-door luxury sedan is expensive, exotic and rare. And therein lies its appeal. You won’t see one on every corner. And whether you’re admiring it in your driveway or from the sumptuous leather interior with its signature Trident-sporting analog clock, there is no doubt where this car came from. The Quattroporte is an Italian feast of sensory delights. It’s quick, but not as quick as, say, a Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG (0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds versus the Quattroporte GTS’ 4.6 seconds), nor as technology laden as an Audi A8. But it is distinctive, which is powerful stuff in the rarefied segment in which it competes.

Few others will match that blend as well.","ConsMaybe you think it’s fun, and it can be. But the fuel economy is not wonderful, the styling results in some pretty bad blind spots in dealing with traffic, and surprising for an SUV, there’s not much space for cargo.",27000,"Driving the Used 2014 Toyota FJ CruiserIt’s an SUV, yes, but the 2014 Toyota FJ Cruiser really is a vehicle for all seven days of the week, with noteworthy capabilities off-road and accommodating manners on the highway. Perhaps our biggest complaint is that the narrow windows and big pillars result in limited outward visibility with really annoying blind spots that make maneuvering in traffic or changing lanes awkward and difficult. Otherwise, it’s like driving any Toyota pickup. Go where the pavement ends, however, and it’s in its element. The big tires, ample ground clearance, steep approach and departure angles and helpful traction control give the FJ outstanding capabilities in dealing with the wilderness primeval. It’s wider than the Jeep Wrangler, but it’s far better in everyday life. Overall, the FJ has a lot to offer in comparison to the Wrangler or the Nissan Xterra, and we think that for daily driving it would be the best of the three.
Interior ComfortToyota engineers and designers gave the 2014 FJ Cruiser an interior that’s very well-suited to a combination of off-road rigors and daily driving commutes. It’s functional, durable, modern and accommodatingly comfortable. Seats are upholstered in water-resistant fabric and rubber is used on the floor. Rear-seat bottoms are removable for extra storage space and large rotary knobs can be operated while wearing gloves. Keeping watch over the proceedings is the inclinometer, which measures tilt of the body and might help prevent the embarrassment of tipping the SUV over and into the bottom of some canyon.
Exterior StylingYou won’t lose the Toyota FJ Cruiser in the mall parking lot. With its height, distinctive round headlights, rectangular grille, 2-tone color treatment and roof rack, the FJ is not only an obvious SUV descendant of the original FJ, it’s unlike anything else on the road. Add in the big tires, the rear-mounted spare, optional floodlights on the mirrors and three wiper arms to deal with the narrow windshield, and the FJ is definitely making a statement of rugged readiness.
Favorite FeaturesALL-AROUND CAPABILITIESVehicles that are good off-road tend to be awkward, uncomfortable or annoying in daily use but, except for the limited visibility, the FJ Cruiser is just fine as a daily driver, and that’s a plus.
A-TRACBy automatically applying the brakes to a spinning wheel, Toyota’s active traction-control system sends torque to the opposing wheel and enhances the FJ Cruiser’s off-road capability.

Engine & TransmissionThe FJ Cruiser is powered by a strong, durable and well-proven 4.0-liter V6 of 260 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque, matched with either a 5-speed automatic transmission with the 2-wheel drive (2WD) or part-time 4-wheel drive (4WD) system, or a 6-speed manual transmission with full-time 4WD. The 4WD models have a 2-speed transfer case. Locking differentials and a sophisticated traction-control system give the FJ extraordinary off-road capabilities, while steep approach and departure angles help with clambering over tough boulders and fording awkward rivers. The power goes to the ground through an independent front and live-axle rear suspension, and the FJ can tow trailers up to 5,000 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2014 Toyota FJ Cruiser has no significant changes from the previous model.
For those old enough to remember, the 2014 Toyota FJ Cruiser SUV is vaguely reminiscent of the original FJ40 Land Cruisers that help build the company’s reputation for rugged durability roughly a half-century ago. While it certainly looks newer, it has kept the original’s straightforward feel, with no excess luxury trimmings or frills – just the capability to go nearly anywhere. Some might line it up against the Jeep Wrangler, but there are significant differences. The FJ’s roof is not removable and the FJ is obviously finished to a higher level than the decidedly more utilitarian Jeep.

The Taurus’ size might be a compelling argument, but with a tall rear deck and narrow side glass, it can feel a bit claustrophobic for drivers of a smaller stature.",27500,"Driving the Used 2014 Ford TaurusFull size sedans aren’t supposed to move like the 2014 Ford Taurus moves, at least not when they cost less than $30,000. The Taurus is no 7 Series, but does deliver impressive ride comfort, a serene cabin and adept handling – not to mention impressive acceleration from both the V6 and turbocharged EcoBoost engines. High tech allies such as Ford’s Torque Vectoring and Curve Control help keep the Taurus bulk in check. By using very slight brake force applied at specific wheels, these systems help the Taurus round curves with assuredness. The view from the Taurus’ driver’s seat isn’t bad, although we found the wide B-pillar just behind the driver’s head and the front windshield pillars to be rather thick, obstructing our side view. Fortunately, the Taurus’ exterior mirrors are a vast help, as is the optional ""BLIS"" system that warns of objects too close to the vehicle’s side when changing lanes.
Interior ComfortThe Ford Taurus for 2014 is equipped to carry five, but four adults would be the prime number for comfort over long distances. The driver and front passenger can enjoy the available massaging seats, helping to negate back fatigue on long drives. Climate-controlled front seats providing both heating and cooling are also offered. Most of the Taurus audio and navigation controls can be operated via the steering wheel or by voice command. Further separating itself from the pedestrian family sedan, the 2014 Taurus offers such upscale options as automatic high-beam dimmers, Adaptive Cruise Control, blind-spot monitoring, and a power sunshade for the rear window.
Exterior StylingCompared to most sedans, the 2014 Ford Taurus is far from being in the norm. It’s a tall sedan, with wide doors and a low roof, and a steeply raked windshield and rear window. The Taurus’ large rear deck creates a vast 20-cubic-foot trunk capable of carrying a week’s worth of luggage or two golf bags, and the low liftover makes it easy to get things in and out.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER ECOBOOST ENGINEFord’s turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine cranks out 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque (that’s more torque than Ford’s standard 3.5-liter V6), yet attains an impressive 32-mpg highway figure.
FORD’S MYKEYThis system can be used to restrict vehicle speed, limit audio system volume and control other functions when a specific key is used to start the vehicle. In effect, MyKey lets parents better control the driving habits of their children, even when they aren’t along for the ride.
Standard FeaturesIncluded on the 2014 Taurus’ list of standard equipment are a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power driver’s seat, steering-wheel controls for audio and cruise control, power windows with one-touch up/down functions for the driver, and Ford’s programmable MyKey system. The standard audio system is a 6-speaker CD player with an auxiliary audio input jack. Standard safety features include antilock disc brakes, electronic traction and stability control, dual front airbags, front-seat-mounted side airbags and side-curtain airbags protecting both the front and rear passengers.

Other options include heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, Intelligent Access with push-button start, a power rear sunshade, power adjustable pedals, the SYNC voice-activated communications and entertainment system (standard on Limited and SHO), and a 12-speaker premium Sony audio system. On the safety front, the optional Blind Spot Information System alerts you to vehicles in your blind spots, while Cross-Traffic Alert warns of approaching traffic when you’re backing up. Lane Keep System helps the driver keep in his own lane.

Optional on front-wheel-drive (FWD) models is Ford’s 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder. The Taurus SHO offers 77 more horsepower than the standard Taurus V6, thanks to the use of direct-injection technology and twin turbochargers. With the exception of the SE trim, all Taurus models also feature steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, providing manual control of the transmission.

Ford’s 2014 Taurus is working the full-size sedan market against newer rivals like the Toyota Avalon and all-new Chevrolet Impala. A tough task considering how good the competition is, but the Taurus has many tricks up its sleeve, starting with its engine lineup. A V6 is a must in this class and the Taurus has a fine one, but it also offers a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that is surprisingly robust and fuel-efficient. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the mighty SHO, powered by a twin-turbocharged V6 and AWD. Of course, the Taurus is also a technological player, with the latest in voice activated interfaces (SYNC), as well as safety and security features like Ford’s Lane Keeping System and Adaptive Cruise Control.

The Prius offers a choice of power modes ranging from pure electric (EV) to performance mode (Power), or the most efficient use of both powertrains (Eco). Although the Prius can function purely in electric mode, it can do so only for a short time and at low speeds. Maximum efficiency exists in the Eco mode, which maximizes fuel economy, even shutting down the air conditioning at idle to save fuel. The plug-in version operates the same way only it can drive on pure electric at higher speeds, but just for about 11 miles. For those who like a challenge, the Prius can actually top its EPA estimates when driven conservatively by taking advantage of regenerative braking, avoiding hard acceleration and keeping speeds low.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Toyota Prius hybrid hatchback features an interior as modern and different as its exterior. The contoured dash looks particularly handsome with its 2-tone panels, although on base models the gray-colored plastic and fabric look a little dull. The Prius’ steering wheel incorporates a wheel-like control that operates the Touch Tracer Display controlling a number of fuel-usage and hybrid-operation displays on the Prius’ LCD information screen. Plant-derived (and recyclable) plastic resins are used for the seat cushions and lower door panels.
Exterior StylingThere’s no mistaking a Toyota Prius hybrid. The 5-door hatchback’s familiar shape is not exactly head-turning, but it’s clearly efficient and slippery. Even the car’s wheel covers are aerodynamic. The roof’s apex is pushed rearward, creating a slightly sporty appearance while simultaneously maximizing rear-seat headroom. Most models ride on 15-inch wheels, but the Prius Five has 17-inchers. Plug-in Prius models feature a port on the right side where the charging cable goes, while the left side has a traditional gas cap. Plug-in models also have a distinct grille, wheels, door handles and lights.
Favorite FeaturesSOLAR ROOF PACKAGEThe Solar Roof Package includes solar cells embedded just behind the moonroof. This feature helps keep the cabin cool by powering a small ventilating fan when the interior gets too hot.
POWER BUTTONWe all like to save gas, but when needed we also like power to merge, pass and accelerate. Selecting the Power setting gives a bit more urgency to the Prius’ forward motion, although it’s not neck-snapping acceleration by any means.
Standard FeaturesA 2014 Toyota Prius Two hybrid includes a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with air-conditioning controls and Touch Tracer Display, height-adjustable driver’s seat, auto up/down on all windows, push-button start, two 12-volt power outlets, a 6.1-inch touch-screen audio display and Bluetooth. Trim levels Three through Five bring upgraded audio systems with Entune telematics, navigation, heated and power-adjustable driver’s seat, 17-inch alloy wheels and energy-saving LED headlights and fog lights. The Plug-in Hybrid version comes as a base model with up-level features such as navigation, and as an Advanced version with Dynamic Radar Cruise Control and a head-up display.
Factory OptionsSeveral advanced safety systems are available for the top-of-the-line Prius Five, including Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, head-up display, the Pre-Collision System, Lane Keep Assist and Intelligent Parking Assist. All are offered in the Advanced Technology Package, which includes the Navigation Package. The optional power moonroof (Prius Three, Four) has solar-powered ventilation and remote-start air conditioning to help keep the vehicle cool. The dealer-installed Plus Performance accessory package adds a sport-tuned suspension with stiffer springs, ground effects, 17-inch lightweight alloy wheels, lower-profile tires, and a rear anti-roll bar.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Toyota Prius hybrid is powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine mated mechanically and electronically to a 60-kilowatt electric motor, all working with a continuously variable transmission and a nickel-metal hydride battery pack. Total hybrid system horsepower is 134. The Plug-in Hybrid model uses a higher-capacity lithium-ion battery that can be charged from any outlet for up to 11 miles of pure-electric operation. The Prius’ EPA city/highway fuel economy rating is 51/48. Learn to manage the system, utilizing regenerative braking and the low-speed full EV mode whenever possible, and you can push actual mileage even higher. The Plug-in Hybrid has a rating of 51/49 mpg for standard hybrid operation, and 95 MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent) by the EPA’s plug-in-hybrid formula.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Toyota Prius hybrid and plug-in hybrid remain unchanged for model year 2014.
As heir to the world’s first mass-produced hybrid car, the 2014 Toyota Prius must fill some pretty big shoes. Luckily, the 5-door hatchback has all the help it needs, with brisk sales of the original car and an army of teammates including a plug-in model, a larger wagon variant and a smaller compact. All Prius models use the same powertrain technology that has become the benchmark for Toyota’s hybrid cars: a fuel-efficient gas engine teamed to an electric motor. This setup allows the Prius to run solely on electric power for short distances, on gasoline for longer trips and a combination of the two when zipping around town or asking for more power. The result is exceptional fuel economy in an inexpensive, albeit bland, family car.

Welcome to the 2014 Toyota Camry.","ConsIf anything approaching an edgier style is important, there are lots of other good choices. All of them are excellent cars with good value. And, the Camry is not available with all-wheel drive, which may be important for dealing with bad weather.",22000,"Driving the Used 2014 Toyota CamryThe Camry has always been known for smooth comfort but, while it may surprise some, the 2014 version is more than just merely competent in getting down the road, even when the pavement takes a lot of twists and turns. The 2014 Camry delivers a better ride than past models, with handling and response that would likely amaze and delight previous owners. The steering imparts confidence, both in feel and the precision of its directional stability, and the rigid body structure and compliant suspension take up the bumps and turns with smooth grace. Along with the commendable ride and handling, the 2014 Camry also gets high marks for its quiet interior, which might even seem somewhat eerily silent. Add it all up, and the Camry no longer has to be considered for its utilitarian and resale values alone.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Toyota Camry interior is everything you should find in a midsize sedan – roomy, comfortable, stylish and luxurious. There’s plenty of headroom, hip room and legroom in all positions, the seats are supportive and the lower cushion of the 60/40 folding rear bench seat has been configured to deliver decent space for the passenger in the middle, a spot that is often neglected. If those passengers need to carry some gear they’ll find the trunk is more than ample, although the Hybrid’s trunk is smaller by slightly over two cubic feet.
Exterior StylingWhile the 2014 Camry doesn’t have the edgy looks of some of the competition, it has still come a long way from the almost-generic appearance of the past. No longer will you lose it in the parking lot because it blends into the background of the mall. There is now a wedge-shape to the profile, artful detailing front and rear, a grille and front end with more presence and an overall look of modern, contemporary substance. It’s a handsome car, by all accounts.
Favorite FeaturesUPGRADED HYBRID SYNERGY DRIVE (HSD)Taking a much-needed next step in the greener arena, the 2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid features Toyota’s most technologically advanced HSD system to date. Light, tight and impressively integrated, the system yields spirited performance under all conditions and an eye-popping set of fuel economy numbers.
UNBEATABLE RECORD OF LONG-TERM VALUECertainly not the most thrilling subject, the cold, hard truth is that a primary appeal of the Camry is its long-term value, as typified by its proven record of reliability and its legendary resale numbers. It’s that long-term value that keeps the Camry at the top of the sales charts.
Standard FeaturesThe base 2014 Camry L sedan offers numerous power assists, air conditioning, cruise control, Display Audio with USB/iPod inputs, Bluetooth, Toyota’s STAR safety system and 10 airbags. The LE adds keyless remote entry, a multifunction steering wheel, and an upgraded Display Audio sound system. Moving up to the Camry SE nets you a dedicated sport suspension/wheel/tire package with unique trim, Softex covered sport seats and paddle shifters. The SE Sport adds in even bigger wheels, and a sunroof. The top-line Camry XLE sedan features dual power seats, dual-zone climate control, a power moonroof and premium fabric or leather (V6-only) upholstery. Both the SE/XLE V6s add Navigation and Entune multimedia telematics, HD radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The Camry Hybrid sedan offers LE and XLE trim-level appointments.
Factory OptionsThe 2014 Toyota Camry sedan’s options are limited to color choices on the L trim and a power driver’s seat and moonroof on the LE. SE/XLE buyers can opt for upgraded Display Audio packages with Navigation and Entune – including a 10-speaker premium JBL system – as well as dedicated Convenience Packages and Leather-trimmed Ultrasuede Sport Seats, while SEs can also be had with a power moonroof. Camry Hybrids offer a Leather Package, Moonroof Package and two tiers of JBL-enhanced Upgrade Packages, one with Navigation and one without.
Engine & TransmissionCamry buyers can select from three powertrains. The base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder makes 178 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque and delivers exemplary fuel economy, being rated at 35 mpg on the highway. The 3.5-liter V6 makes a thoroughly robust 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque and, with all that, is still EPA-rated at 31 mpg on the highway. All the gasoline-only powertrains are matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission. For those who want super fuel-economy numbers, the Camry Hybrid, with its 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine combined with an electric motor for a total system output of 200 horsepower, is rated at 43 mpg in the city and 39 mpg on the highway for the LE model, or 40 and 38, respectively, for the XLE.

Read Full Review","What's New?As the Camry was significantly revised for 2013, the changes for 2014 are minimal. A new addition to the line is the SE Sport, available only with a 4-cylinder engine. The Sport also adds a standard sunroof, 8-way power-adjustable driver seat, and 18-inch wheels and tires.
For 2014, the Toyota Camry represents the best example of the optimum 4-door sedan for the greatest number of potential buyers. Everything about it settles it smack in the middle ground of what the vast majority of buyers want in a sedan and, therefore, while not being the most exciting thing on the road it definitely has enormous and well-deserved appeal. The models range from the base L to a sporty SE Sport to the very luxurious XLE, and include a highly-efficient hybrid model. Midsize sedans are the heart of the car market and in 2014, the segment is more competitive than ever, with highly-attractive models from Honda, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Mazda, Chevrolet and Ford, but the 2014 Camry remains the top choice for the greatest number of buyers.

The Dodge Durango, meanwhile, offers a V8 in a segment that otherwise relies on V6 engines. If the high mileage is tantamount, the Nissan Pathfinder achieves up to 26 mpg.
What's New?For 2014 the Traverse adds twin USB ports for 2nd-row passengers to keep electronic devices powered up. Forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to the Traverse’s roster of safety features.
As fuel prices fluctuate and more people downsize, a stream of buyers are shying away from thirsty, truck-based SUVs as the family hauler of choice. This has spawned a hot market for crossover sport-utility vehicles, which have room for growing families like a traditional SUV, but offer a sedan-like ride and better fuel-efficiency. The poster child for this segment could easily be the Chevrolet Traverse. Since debuting in 2009, the Traverse has shined as an alternative to both traditional SUVs and the oft-stigmatized minivan. Since then, vehicles such as the Ford Explorer and Nissan Pathfinder have softened from their rugged ways to join the crossover-SUV party that also includes the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Mazda CX-9. Though the cast grows, the Traverse more than holds its own.
Used 2014 Chevrolet Traverse PricingThe 2014 Chevrolet Traverse LS has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $31,670. AWD adds $2,000 to the bottom line. A fully loaded Chevy Traverse LTZ can push the price to over $45,000. The 2014 Traverse’s starting price is slightly higher than competitors such as the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Pathfinder, all of which are also slightly smaller. Buyers searching for the bargain haulers in this segment should check out the Kia Sorento (starting under $25,000) and Dodge Journey (around $20,000 with 7-passenger seating). Before buying, be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for a 2014 Traverse. Down the road, we expect the Traverse’s resale value to be in line the Ford Explorer, but not as high as the Toyota Highlander or Honda Pilot.
Driving the Used 2014 Chevrolet TraverseEven with its formidable and growing competition, the Chevy Traverse is one of our favorite crossover SUVs to drive. Its V6 engine is smooth and strong, and easily gets the vehicle up to speed in both front-wheel-drive (FWD) and all-wheel-drive (AWD) form. The Traverse is larger than its competitors but doesn’t feel bloated or overwhelming on the road. The view to the front and sides is commanding and the ride is comfortable. As is the case with other 3-row SUVs, rear visibility is hindered to the left and right due to the Traverse’s last row of seats and small windows. When tested in a setting far from the Traverse’s comfort zone – a track – this big crossover-ute felt planted during hard cornering and braking, even on slick pavement. It’s not as dynamic as the sporty Mazda CX-9, however, with comfort justifiably the priority over corner-carving.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Chevy Traverse has three rows of seats and can be had in 7- or 8-passenger configuration. Lower trims are built for eight with a bench in the second row, while upper trims can seat seven with a pair of roomy captain’s chairs in the second row. Interior comfort varies with trim level. Base LS models make do with cloth seating and manual-adjust front seats, while top-line LTZ models are luxury-like with perforated leather seats that are heated and cooled up front. No matter what trim you choose, the Traverse is big enough for adults to sit in the third row and still have room for groceries.
Exterior StylingThe Traverse is going on five years in its current design, but its styling is holding up well thanks to tweaks to the front and rear that came last year. Where others are blocky (Honda Pilot) and brawny (Ford Explorer), the 2014 Traverse retains its pleasing, rounded (maybe too rounded at the rear) shape. Entry-level LS models ride on 17-inch steel wheels, LT models are emboldened with 18-inch aluminum-alloy versions, and the top LTZ trim receives big 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. LTZ models are further set apart with dual exhaust outlets, body-color moldings and chrome accents. Lower trims have a manual liftgate, while more expensive trims feature a power-operated one.
Favorite FeaturesSMART SLIDE 2ND-ROW SEATGetting into a 3rd-row seat can be a hassle, especially for less-than-limber adults. This feature makes reaching that last row easier with a one-hand operation that creates easy access.
ADDITIONAL USB INPUTSHere’s a feature that’s largely forgotten about – right until you need it. When your kid’s tablet or MP3 player runs out of juice, the dual USB power inputs in back can make the difference between tears and cheers.
Standard FeaturesNo matter which trim you choose, the 2014 Traverse offers quite a bit for the money beyond sheer space. Spend the least on an LS version and you’ll still drive away with keyless entry, a rear-vision backup camera, AM/FM/CD/satellite audio with a 6.5-inch touch-screen display. LT trims add interior wood treatments, 18-inch wheels, a power driver’s seat and leather-wrapped steering wheel, while LTZ versions bring heated/cooled front seats, a heated steering wheel, leather, and Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning. For the all-important cup holders, you get 10 for 7-passenger configurations and a dozen for 8-passenger models.
Factory OptionsOptions vary across trim levels for the 2014 Traverse, but all models can be had with all-wheel drive for better traction instead of the standard front-wheel drive. Other available features are navigation with traffic data, blind-spot monitoring with a rear cross-traffic alert system (standard on LTZ trim), a power liftgate, 10-speaker Bose audio, a rear-seat DVD system, and a dual-panel sunroof. Chevrolet’s MyLink Touch telematics system combines Bluetooth audio streaming, hands-free phone communication, voice recognition, and compatibility with apps such as Pandora. GM’s OnStar Directions and Connections service can be extended by subscription after six months of free coverage.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Chevy Traverse uses a sophisticated 3.6-liter V6 with direct-injection and variable-valve-timing technology that helps it achieve a good balance of power and fuel economy. In LS and LT trims, the engine makes 281 horsepower. LTZ models have a dual-exhaust system that bumps that figure to 288 horsepower. All models use a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission with a manual-shift mode. The Traverse is rated to tow a commendable 5,200 pounds, and all can run on regular unleaded fuel.

That upper end sounds like a lot of money for a Kia, but the 2014 Sorento is a lot of car, both in features and refinement. Kia’s dramatically improved resale values only bolster the Sorento’s already impressive value proposition.
Driving the Used 2014 Kia SorentoWhat the 2014 Kia Sorento gives up in interior volume to its larger competitors, it gains in everyday maneuverability. The Sorento is seven inches shorter than a Honda Pilot, with a shorter wheelbase and tighter turning radius, making the Kia easier to navigate into and out of the many parking spaces it’s likely to visit on a daily basis. Out on the road, the Sorento’s new 290-horsepower V6 and smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission combine to deliver responsive, seamless acceleration. Our very first taste of the revised Sorento included a 6-hour drive from Arizona to California, and at no point did highway ride or seat comfort elicit a second thought. Powertrain and structural enhancements were a big part of the Sorento’s upgrade for 2014, and the result is a crossover SUV that drives with a sense of refinement comparable to some of its best competitors.
Interior ComfortInterior highlights from the well-equipped 2014 Kia Sorento models we’ve driven include small touches like a leather transmission selector boot, unexpected features like an LCD speedometer, retractable 2nd-row window shades, and a huge panoramic moonroof. Combined with a next-gen level of refinement for Kia, you’ll have a hard time finding a nicer interior for the money. The Sorento definitely gives up some passenger and cargo room to just about every other 3-row SUV worth considering, but a rear seat that slides, reclines and folds down in 40/20/40 sections adds valuable flexibility. The optional third row is best reserved for little ones.
Exterior StylingIf not for the new taillights, it’d be hard to distinguish the 2014 Sorento from its 2013 predecessor. But the front end has been redesigned, too, and there are a number of neat upgrades all around. The headlights now offer an LED design element, the exterior mirrors will fold in at the push of a button, and the exterior door pockets light up to welcome you back at night. Stepping all the way up to the SX Limited nets xenon HID headlights, unique 19-inch wheels and red brake calipers, but even the base models have a finished look that includes 17-inch aluminum wheels.
Favorite FeaturesUVO eSERVICESIn addition to a bunch of other cool infotainment capabilities – many of them voice-activated – Kia’s next-gen UVO system leverages your smartphone to automatically call 911 in the event of an airbag deployment, and lets you send a navigation destination from your computer to the car.
FLEXSTEERAs part of its new electric power steering system, the 2014 Sorento includes a FlexSteer feature that lets the driver select between Comfort, Normal and Sport steering modes. Comfort mode feels the least artificial, making small corrections easier and mitigating some of the compromise of efficiency-enhancing electric steering.
Standard FeaturesA base model 2014 Kia Sorento LX starts at $24,950, including destination, with a 4-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive and two rows of cloth seats. Standard feature highlights include Bluetooth and USB phone/audio connectivity, air conditioning, cruise control, and steering wheel-mounted controls. Outside, alloy wheels, body-color side mirrors and LED taillights help the entry-priced Sorento present about as well as pricier trims. The full complement of electronic and inflatable safety equipment is also standard.
Factory OptionsA 2014 Kia Sorento SX stickers at $38,550 with a V6 engine and all-wheel drive, leather seats (heated and cooled in front), three rows of seating, a panoramic moonroof, keyless entry and touch-start, blind-spot monitoring, and the full UVO eServices infotainment setup including an 8-inch touch-screen display, navigation and a 10-speaker Infinity audio system. For another $3,000 you can step up to the SX Limited, with softer Nappa leather, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, and a handful of exterior touches.
Engine & TransmissionBecause the 4-cylinder engine isn’t markedly cheaper or more efficient than the V6, and because the V6’s 290 horsepower is a lot to feed through only the front wheels, we recommend the 2014 Kia Sorento with its new V6 engine and all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system features a locking center differential for especially difficult conditions, and incorporates a new Torque Vectoring Cornering Control system that further enhances drivability. All Sorento configurations offer the same 6-speed, manually selectable automatic transmission.

Read Full Review","What's New?Kia says more than 80 percent of the parts in the 2014 Sorento are either all-new or redesigned. The net result is an SUV that looks a little different but feels significantly more refined, and offers an impressive set of convenience and infotainment technologies, including the new UVO eServices system.
Having undergone a more extensive update than its mildly refreshed exterior would suggest, the 2014 Kia Sorento is now an even more appealing package for tech-minded shoppers who want 3-row flexibility but not the bulk of a typical midsize SUV. But the Sorento is also available in a 2-row configuration, making it a viable alternative to 5-seat SUVs like the Ford Edge, too. In either case, the 2014 Kia Sorento offers more features for the money – including a leading-edge infotainment offering – with little to no compromise in overall refinement. Similarly sized competitors include the Dodge Journey and Mitsubishi Outlander, but the Sorento is the clear winner in that race. That’s why we named it one of the 10 Best SUVs Under"

The EcoBoost 4-cylinder may be the least powerful of the three, but with 240 horsepower on tap it’s no slouch and its 30-mpg highway rating is equally impressive. If you want AWD, you’re going to have to move up to the 3.5-liter V6, which provides excellent power for passing and cruising without a great sacrifice in fuel economy. At the top of the pecking order is the 3.7-liter V6 in the Edge Sport. This model delivers the best performance and handling of the four trims, but its ride is decidedly firm and the big wheel/tire combo makes for more noise inside the cabin. Overall, we found all the Edge trims provided good handling, although the steering feels a bit heavy at times.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Ford Edge is not considered a luxury car like its twin, the Lincoln MKX, but step inside the Ford and you might forget you’re in the blue-collar version. The Edge’s optional MyFord Touch telematics system includes customizable displays on both sides of the speedometer, as well as an 8-inch monitor in the center stack. Learning this technology takes time, and models fitted with the large touch-screen panel can prove frustrating when all you want to do is something as simple as adjusting the climate. Front and back, passenger space is abundant and comfortable. Behind the seats, cargo room is good.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Edge has a squat, bulldog-like stance that stands apart from boxy and more traditional SUVs whose shapes are often dictated by the addition of a small 3rd-row seat. The Edge’s high beltline and gently sloping rear give the vehicle a tough yet elegant appearance. Large housings make room for wheels ranging in size from 17 inches to a whopping 22 inches. Ford’s 3-bar chrome grille makes a big statement up front, and on top-line Sport models it is blacked out for further distinction. In back, 4-inch dual exhaust outlets give the 2014 Edge a sportier look.
Favorite FeaturesHD RADIO WITH SONG TAGGINGThis subscription-free digital tuner brings in FM stations with higher quality and includes an iTunes tagging feature that lets you mark a song you like so you can download it later. The technology is part of the robust SYNC system available in higher-trim Edge models.
VISTA ROOFThis optional feature creates an open feeling to the Edge’s cabin. Over the front seats is a glass panel that slides and opens, while rear-seat passengers can peer through a fixed-window skylight.
Standard FeaturesA base 2014 Ford Edge SE comes with a 3.5-liter V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, remote keyless entry, AM/FM/CD player with audio input jack, cloth seating, reclining 60/40 rear seats, and capless fuel-filler system. SEL models add features like dual-zone automatic climate control, 10-way power driver’s seat, and 18-inch wheels.

At the top of the line is the Sport model with a powerful 3.7-liter V6 engine, 22-inch wheels and a rearview camera.
Factory OptionsFeature options vary by trim, but among them are the 2-panel Vista Roof, navigation system, adaptive cruise control, DVD rear-seat entertainment system, power liftgate, heated front seats, and a blind-spot monitoring system, as well as all-wheel drive on V6 models. All trims except Sport can be had with the smaller and more fuel-efficient 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. Those wanting to tow can equip the Edge with a Class II trailer package with sway control.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2014 the Ford Edge has a choice of V6 engines and a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that offers up to 30 mpg and more torque than the base V6. The sole transmission is a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic. The most powerful engine is the 3.7-liter V6 and is reserved for Sport models. Both V6 engines can be had with all-wheel drive, while the 4-cylinder Edge comes only in front-wheel-drive (FWD) form. All models of the Edge can be equipped for towing. The 4-cylinder Edge has a maximum tow rating of 1,500 pounds, the 3.5-liter V6 can tow up to 2,000 pounds, and the 3.7-liter V6 can handle up to 3,500 pounds.

Read Full Review","What's New?Changes are relatively minor for the 2014 Ford Edge, limited mostly to some new colors and the latest generation of Ford’s SYNC and MyTouch systems.
As gasoline prices remain high, more and more buyers are coming to the conclusion that sometimes less is more. If you don’t need 3-row seating or a big V8 engine, a vehicle like the 2014 Ford Edge may solve most of your transportation problems. With its available turbocharged EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine, the Edge returns up to 30 mpg on the highway while sacrificing nothing in the way of power and acceleration. Those who have to live with winter’s worst will appreciate the available all-wheel drive (AWD) and powerful V6, while enthusiast drivers will delight at the Sport model. However, because the Edge design is starting to age, it faces stiff competition from the likes of the Toyota Highlander, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

The Hybrid models tack on an additional $4,000 to the bottom line. In base form, the Nissan Juke undercuts the XV Crosstrek by a few thousand dollars, but does not include the same level of standard equipment. Larger compact SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V start just above $23,000 and easily surpass the $30,000 mark when fully loaded. To see what consumers in your area are actually paying for their XV Crosstreks, take a look at KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price at the bottom of this page. As for resale value, we expect the 2014 XV Crosstrek to perform slightly better than the Nissan Juke, but not as well as the increasingly popular Mini Countryman.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru XV CrosstrekBecause it’s based largely on the Subaru Impreza platform, the 2014 XV Crosstrek delivers an exceptionally stable and secure ride. The soft suspension settings do a good job of soaking up road imperfections that feel like rude jolts in other compact SUVs. Yet, despite the tall ride height and softer springs, the XV Crosstrek doesn’t bob or sway when tossed into tight turns. The Crosstrek uses an electric-assist power-steering system that lacks feedback but also requires little effort when parallel parking in the city or rock crawling in the wilds. The Crosstrek’s weakest spot is its 148-horsepower engine that doesn’t offer much in the way of passing power or rapid acceleration, especially when there are two, three or four passengers onboard. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does its best to find the optimal power band, but it causes the engine to thrash loudly at full throttle.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-size adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate. Unfortunately, the navigation radio is required if you want SiriusXM satellite radio.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many “compact” SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEThe beauty of the XV Crosstrek’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is that it is permanently engaged, sending power to all four wheels before loss of traction can occur. The system is light, compact and very reliable.
NUMEROUS DEALER ADD-ONSThose who plan on adventuring beyond a hotel parking lot will love all the additional equipment Subaru offers for the XV Crosstrek. There are bike and ski racks, roof-mounted cargo carriers and even interior upgrades including a 110-volt outlet and 10-inch powered subwoofer. The little XV Crosstrek is big on choice.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers and subwoofer from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 XV Crosstrek is powered by a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed “boxer” 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip. The XV Crosstrek Hybrid uses the same 2.0-liter engine and pairs it with an electric motor integrated into the CVT. The motor produces 13.4 horsepower from 1,500-6,000 rpm, for a total hybrid system output of 160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. The starter and alternator functions are combined into one unit, and the engine is equipped with an Auto Stop/Start feature. The hybrid can travel on pure electric power for short distances at speeds below 25 mph.

Models equipped with navigation now feature the Aha infotainment app.
If there is one thing Subaru owners love about their vehicles it is ground clearance. So, when Subaru decided to make a new SUV from its popular Impreza hatchback, they started by raising it to a whopping 8.7 inches. Toss in a little cladding, some cool colors and snappy rims, and you’ve got the 2014 XV Crosstrek. Although not terribly powerful, the XV Crosstrek is easy on your fuel budget, and it can go places most of its rivals can’t. Priced around"

With a starting price well below $20,000, the 2014 Subaru Impreza offers the same features and fuel economy as many of its compact competitors, but with the added advantage of standard Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive (AWD). While the bread-and-butter cars make up the majority of Impreza sales, the performance-oriented WRX and WRX STI account for a small but loyal audience who crave speed and agility over fuel economy and a low sticker price. Regardless of which model, the Impreza offers a lot of value for the money. However, if you don’t have a need for all-wheel drive, you can find similar front-drive compacts with better fuel economy, such as the Mazda Mazda3, Kia Forte and Chevrolet Cruze diesel.
Used 2014 Subaru Impreza PricingA base 2014 Subaru Impreza sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $19,000 plus an additional $300 fee for Partial Zero Emissions packages on cars sold in California and some other states. Five-door hatchback models are $500 extra. A well-optioned Impreza can reach about $25,000. WRX performance models start just under $27,000, and the fire-breathing WRX STI is around $35,000 and can reach about $40,000 loaded. On the low end, the Impreza’s price is in the realm of the Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra, Chevy Cruze and Ford Focus. Prices for WRX and STI models straddle that of the VW Golf R, and the WRX is in line with the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are playing for the Subaru Impreza. In the long term, the Impreza’s resale value is predicted to hold up very well, above most competitors.
Driving the Used 2014 Subaru ImprezaSubaru’s whole identity revolves around its patented Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system, which is standard on every car it makes, save for the BRZ. Unlike most AWD setups, the Impreza’s is permanently engaged, sending power to whichever wheel or wheels need it most and providing excellent traction on dry and wet pavement. The CVT transmission may not be to everyone’s liking, but it does manage to milk the little 2.0-liter engine for maximum power and fuel efficiency. Those who desire more power and less boredom can move to the turbocharged WRX, which still gets fairly good fuel economy but is much more fun to drive. The ultimate WRX is the STI, with more power, a better manual gearbox and additional settings to adjust the center differential for optimum power distribution at the wheels. The STI is not without its detractors: Key complaints are the harsh ride, loud interior and somewhat flat sport seats.
Interior Comfort“Simple” and “easy-to-use” would be the best way of describing the Impreza’s interior. “Plain” may be another. Everything here is functional, and most operations are easy to accomplish, except for the buttons for heating the front seats on models so equipped – they are awkwardly located below the driver’s-side armrest. Impreza models can be made cozier with leather-trimmed upholstery. Passenger room is good for four adults, and cargo space is especially generous in 5-door hatchback models, which can swallow more than 52 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seats folded.
Exterior StylingThe Impreza’s exterior styling could be called “polite,” with not many attributes to ruffle feathers. Among the most prominent features are the “hawk-eye” headlights and prominent wheel arches. The 5-door hatchback versions are graced with a gently sloping roof and available cargo racks. WRX and STI models retain the previous generation’s body styles and further stand out with aggressive features, including a hood-mounted air intake, deep side sills, trunk-mounted wings on sedans and four exhaust pipes.
Favorite FeaturesFUEL ECONOMYHigh fuel economy and all-wheel drive rarely go hand in hand, but the 2014 Subaru Impreza offers both. Models with CVT automatic transmissions are rated at up to 36 mpg on the highway.
TURBOCHARGED ENGINEThe high-performance 4-cylinder engines in the Impreza WRX and STI models create much more power than the engine in other Impreza models. The result is blistering acceleration and passing power.
Standard FeaturesThree major trim levels are available on the 2014 Subaru Impreza: 2.0i, 2.0i Premium and 2.0i Limited. Base models are equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, power windows and doors, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, keyless entry and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary and USB inputs and Bluetooth audio streaming. Higher-trim models include the automatic transmission, leather seating, larger wheels, heated front seats, automatic climate control and a 6-speaker audio system with HD Radio. Two wagon-only versions, the 2.0i Sport Premium and Sport Limited, have 17-inch wheels and fog lights. WRX and STI models get stiffer suspensions, and the STI has Brembo brakes.
Factory OptionsOptions for the Impreza include a CVT automatic transmission on models not already so equipped, power moonroof, voice-activated navigation system with 6.1-inch touch screen, cold-weather package with de-icer and heated seats. Other cold-environment accessories include a battery warmer and engine-block heater. WRX and STI performance models can be upgraded with satellite radio, short-throw shifter and turbo-boost gauge.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2014 Subaru Impreza models except the WRX and STI use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine connected to a 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. At 148 horsepower, the engine is adequate to get the car up to speed, but not in a hurry. WRX and STI models use a larger, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that has been turbocharged to make 265 or 305 horsepower, respectively – these are fast cars. The WRX has a 5-speed manual transmission and the STI a 6-speed manual. The Subaru engines are of a type known as “boxer,” in which the cylinders are arranged horizontally and opposed to each other, with the pistons moving somewhat as a boxer punching. These engines’ low center of gravity enhances handling, and they’re known for ruggedness, durability and performance.

Those two traits are among its best, and they remain true whichever of the three powertrains you choose. The standard 4-cylinder offers a sufficient 196 horsepower. Modifications now offer slightly higher fuel economy reaching an estimated 35 mpg on the highway. A new start-stop feature for this engine enhances efficiency in city driving by cutting power instead of idling at stoplights. Turbocharged Malibus now make a hearty 295 lb-ft of torque for better overall performance. Instead of offering a full hybrid, the Malibu Eco offers GM’s eAssist, which consists of a lithium-ion battery and small motor-generator. The system uses a start-stop feature like the one implemented for the standard engine, in addition to a motor-generator that supplies 15 extra horsepower during heavy acceleration. Intriguing as the system may be, fuel economy tops out at 36 mpg, barely beyond the standard powertrain and below that of several competitors.
Interior ComfortThe Malibu’s 5-passenger cabin has an airy, upscale feel in which available leather seating and soft-touch surfaces complement metallic silver trim and chrome accents. For 2014, Chevy has increased rear-passenger kneeroom by redesigning the front seatbacks. The front seats themselves are adequately comfortable, with the driver’s seat offering 8-way power adjustability and 4-way power-operated lumbar support. Though appealing in appearance, the placements of chrome accents are not ideal, as they create considerable glare on sunny days. At over 16 cubic feet, trunk space is impressive (Eco models have about three cubic feet less).
Exterior StylingIn addition to gaining suspension enhancements derived from the Impala full-size sedan, the 2014 Malibu’s front end aesthetics have also been influenced by its bigger brother. The Malibu’s grille is now more prominent, and the windswept headlight housings frame headlights that resemble eagles’ eyes. At the rear, the Malibu features two pairs of red taillight housings that have a familial resemblance to those of recent Camaros. Top-trim LTZ versions feature sporty dual stainless-steel exhaust tips.
Favorite FeaturesBLIND ZONE ALERTThis safety feature has finally made its way to the Malibu, and it can save your bacon on crowded roads. The system works by constantly monitoring the rear side zones where other vehicles often can’t be seen. When detected, an icon alerts the driver to the danger of changing lanes.
MYLINK INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMChevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system features one of the most user-friendly multimedia interfaces on the market. MyLink’s various features, including smartphone integration for Pandora and Stitcher, Bluetooth streaming audio and a comprehensive Gracenote database for simple music related voice-commands, are clearly displayed on a large 7-inch touch screen that flips open to reveal a hidden storage compartment.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Malibu comes in three major trims: LS, LT and LTZ, with the Eco eAssist model within the mid-trim LT grouping. On the least-expensive end, LS models come with features such as 6-speaker audio with AM/FM/CD/satellite radio, cruise control, remote keyless entry, and Bluetooth phone connectivity. Stepping up to LT trims brings a 7-inch touch-screen with MyLink, a USB port for audio devices, Bluetooth audio streaming and a power driver’s seat. Top-line LTZ versions enhance comfort with a power passenger seat, heated front seats and leather upholstery. All 2014 Malibus have 10 airbags and a 6-month trial of GM’s OnStar safety and communications system with automatic crash response.
Factory OptionsDepending on trim level, you can equip Chevy’s midsize sedan with navigation, a power sunroof, a backup camera and leather seating. The Advanced Safety Package includes blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, and a rear cross-traffic alert. Those seeking a premium audio system can opt for a 9-speaker Pioneer setup.
Engine & TransmissionThe Chevy Malibu offers a trio of engine choices: 1. The base 2.5-liter Ecotec 4-cylinder that has been enhanced for 2014 with variable intake valve actuation and auto start-stop for better fuel economy. 2. A powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. 3. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder paired with GM’s eAssist system found in Eco model. The Malibu’s lone transmission offering is a 6-speed automatic with a manual-shift mode. All models are front-wheel drive. On Eco models, the compact eAssist battery resides behind the rear seats. The 15-horsepower electric motor assists the 182 horsepower engine, though it is not capable of independently driving the front wheels like a traditional hybrid. All versions of the Malibu can run on regular unleaded, though premium is recommended for the turbo model.

The sedan’s front end design has been tweaked, while rear-seat kneeroom has grown. Suspension and chassis tweaks aim for a smoother ride.
Just one year after an all-new Malibu was launched to take on the hotly contested midsize-sedan market, Chevrolet has moved quickly to already update the car due to its lukewarm reception. It’s not that the Malibu was a bad sedan, it just didn’t shine among great ones like the Honda Accord, Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima. This segment has never been more competitive, and only a few can be the cream of the crop. For 2014, the Chevy Malibu aims to rise with sleeker design, a roomier back seat, and improved suspension. While still not the sportiest or most stylish sedan out there, the Malibu deserves kudos for its quiet ride and a variety of powertrains that includes a turbo engine and a fuel-saving mild hybrid.

That’s two to three thousand higher than the better-outfitted Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 base models. At the upper end of the price spectrum, a fully loaded Escape Titanium will exceed $37,000. While that’s almost $7,000 more than a loaded CR-V, it also includes a lot more power and technology.

Driving the Used 2014 Ford EscapeThe Ford Escape is the sporty compact car of compact SUVs – a title it shares with the Mazda CX-5. Ford has done well to infuse several of its recent passenger-car offerings with European-like driving dynamics and feel, and the new Escape also benefits from that effort. With its new-last-year 240-horsepower engine, the Escape runs away from most everything else in its class. Those same characteristics that create the fun factor also help make the Escape easy and pleasant to drive to the store and the office. The 1.6- and 2.0-liter EcoBoost engines are terrific, both delivering smooth, ready thrust around town, effortless cruising on the highway and – especially the 2.0 engine – plenty of passing power. This may not be the segment’s softest-riding entry, but most will find it plenty comfortable. Overall, the 2014 Ford Escape is arguably the best-driving compact SUV on the market today.
Interior ComfortThe inside of the 2014 Ford Escape boasts an impressive display of materials, design and available features. You won’t pass it off as a mid-size SUV, though, because the Escape’s interior is less spacious than others in the category.
Exterior StylingLike some others in the compact SUV segment now, the 2014 Ford Escape shows a strong sense of style. Exterior highlights that distinguish upper-tier Escape models include HID headlamps, fog lights, body-color mirrors and trim, dual chrome exhaust tips and big 19-inch wheels.

You could get an Acura RDX for the same money, but you wouldn’t have as many fun features to play with.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Ford Escape offers a choice of three engines (unique in the compact SUV class). The 240-horsepower rating of the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine looks irresistible, but truthfully, the 178-horsepower 1.6-liter version is still plenty powerful, just as smooth, and more affordable and more efficient in the bargain. The base 2.5-liter engine would probably be fine for many owners but it comes only in the base Escape S, which doesn’t look so grand compared to some competitors. All three engines work with a responsive 6-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control, driving either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). If you want AWD you’ll have to choose one of the EcoBoost engines. And if you want the Escape’s full towing capacity of 3,500 pounds, that requires the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine (and note that the towing package eliminates the clever hands-free liftgate option).

Read Full Review","What's New?After its complete character overhaul last year, the Ford Escape gets no significant changes for 2014, just a few minor revisions to equipment and packages.
With last year’s total makeover, the 2014 Ford Escape compact crossover SUV became one of the segment’s leaders in styling, fuel efficiency and forward-looking technology. Highlights include a choice of impressive engines, athletic suspension tuning and an updated version of the MyFord Touch infotainment system. One feature everyone will show off is the power liftgate they can open and close, even with an armload, by waving a foot under the rear bumper. Shoppers may look elsewhere if their top priorities are low price and sheer interior space, but the 2014 Ford Escape is a must-see for everyone else. That’s why we named it one of the 10 Best SUVs Under"

Audio buffs will love the straightforward Entune audio system that includes apps and Bluetooth audio streaming. Those seeking an all-electric SUV will only find it in the 2014 RAV4 EV.","ConsIf you’re looking for power, handling or off-road ability, the 2014 RAV4 won’t impress you. The AWD Subaru Forester offers a powerful turbocharged engine and is more capable when the road turns from asphalt to dirt. The Ford Escape and VW Tiguan also offer turbocharged engines and better handling.",25000,"Driving the Used 2014 Toyota RAV4A short time behind the wheel of the Toyota’s RAV4 for 2014 reveals a vehicle that is well-balanced, quiet at highway speeds and smooth riding over most surfaces. Acceleration is tepid but acceptable, with the RAV4 making the 0-60-mph run in under 10 seconds. To help when passing or merging, Toyota equips the RAV4 with a Sport mode that quickens throttle response and holds shift points longer; the Sport setting also firms up the steering feel. The system includes an Eco mode aimed at maximizing fuel economy at the expense of acceleration. Eco mode is fine if you’re not in a hurry, but we found the lazy throttle response annoying, leaving the system in the Normal mode for most of drive. The RAV4 EV, meanwhile, is surprisingly quick thanks to the peak torque of 273 lb-ft from its electric motor. In sport mode it can zip to 60 mph in seven seconds. In ordinary driving the RAV4 EV feels comfortable and composed. Its EPA-rated range is 103 miles.
Interior ComfortThe RAV4 for 2014 uses high-quality plastics and soft-touch surfaces to create a comfortable and inviting interior. Even base LE trims have contrasting colors, always a good antidote for blandness. The only piece out of step is faux carbon-fiber cladding around the doorsills and gearshift lever. Leather is no longer an option in top models, which now receive a leather-like material called Softex that’s also in the RAV4 EV. We found the driver’s seat comfortable even in base models with cloth, and especially so in the Limited trim with Softex and added lumbar support. Rear legroom is good and the one-pull folding rear seats are easy to operate.
Exterior StylingOne of the biggest aspects of the RAV4’s 2014 design is something that’s missing: the spare tire that has resided on the rear of these SUVs ever since they were tiny 2-door runabouts in the mid-1990s. That isn’t the only relevant change at the RAV4’s posterior. The compact SUV has a rear door that swings up instead of out as on previous-generation RAV4s, making it easier to access and helping shield you from rain as you load groceries. Top-line Limited models feature a power liftgate that can be adjusted to raise to a customized height. The limited-production Toyota RAV4 electric vehicle retains a modified body from the last-generation RAV4.
Favorite FeaturesBLIND-SPOT MONITORINGOnce a safety feature reserved for luxury vehicles, this option is now available in the RAV4 to warn you when drivers enter the side area of your vehicle that you can’t see. Additionally, the system has Rear Cross Traffic Alert to warn you when other vehicles are approaching as you back up.
CAVERNOUS CARGO CAPACITYToyota’s team has worked their interior design magic to create a roomy RAV4. Cargo volume behind the front seats is a class-leading 73.4 cubic feet, and with rear seats that fold flat, all that real estate is easy to fill and use.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 RAV4 is available in three trims: LE, XLE and Limited. Base LE models come nicely equipped with 6-speed automatic transmission, Entune 6.1-inch touch screen, rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, AM/FM/CD system with six speakers and auxiliary/USB inputs. XLE trims add a power moonroof, Entune with HD Radio and iTunes tagging, 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, and front seats with extra bolstering and French stitching. Limited models get a power liftgate, Softex leather-like seating (heated in front), 18-inch wheels, leather-trimmed steering wheel, Entune Premium audio with navigation and apps and push-button starting. All 2014 RAV4s have eight airbags (six for EV models), stability/traction control, and two years/25,000 miles complimentary maintenance. RAV4 EVs are loaded with dual-zone climate control, navigation and Toyota’s Entune smartphone-enabled system.
Factory OptionsAll RAV4 trims except the EV can be equipped with all-wheel drive, which enhances traction in wet weather and on dirt roads. Other options vary by trim level and include a navigation system with Toyota’s Entune telematics system that includes voice recognition and various apps for everything from making reservations to finding sports scores, JBL premium audio system with 11 speakers, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. For the RAV4 EV, a Level 2, Leviton 240-volt home charging system is available.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 RAV4 is powered by a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 176 horsepower, enough to get the SUV up to speed in a decent – but not the quickest – manner. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. The RAV4 will eagerly tow up to 1,500 pounds. The limited-production RAV4 EV has an AC induction motor, lithium-ion battery, and single-speed automatic transmission. All RAV4 EV models are front-wheel drive and not rated for towing. Charging can take over 40 hours on a standard 120-volt outlet, but decreases to as low as five hours on a 40-amp, 240-volt outlet.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2014 Toyota RAV4 gains four new Entune audio choices, including Entune Apps Suite on up-level trims. The Limited gets a new Technology Package option that includes Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Departure Alert and Auto High Beam. The battery-powered model carries over unchanged and is based on the prior-generation RAV4.
While it’s true the RAV4 started the whole compact-crossover SUV genre, lately it has taken a backseat to competitors offering more features, better fuel economy and better styling. Some buyers may not like the deletion of the V6 engine option, but we think most will appreciate Toyota’s newfound commitment to better ergonomics and interior materials. Features such as a standard rearview camera show Toyota’s push toward customer safety. Another area important to consumers is fuel economy, and while not bad, the RAV4’s EPA numbers are bested by competitors such as the Mazda CX-5 and all-wheel-drive Subaru Forester. Likewise, the Mazda CX-5 and Ford Escape offer a more dynamic driving experience, while the Subaru Forester and VW Tiguan offer more powerful turbocharged engines. An all-electric version remains for sale in California.

Styling feeling a little dated",26150,"The Toyota Tacoma is the best-selling midsize truck available, and has been for the past 15 years. There are good reasons for this, namely the Tacoma’s reputation for high quality, high resale value, and a vast variety of engine/cab/bed choices. In fact, with 33 configurations, there’s a Tacoma to suit a wide range of needs and tastes, from an economical work truck to an off-road beast with optional manual transmission.
Today’s Tacoma faces a resurgence in the midsize truck market, with the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon reborn a few years ago, an all-new Ford Ranger also re-entering the market, a new Nissan Frontier around the corner, and the just-arrived Jeep Gladiator appealing to off-road enthusiasts. In the face of these challengers, the 2021 Tacoma remains more than competitive.
The Tacoma got a freshening last year that gave it standard tech like Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and all models include Toyota’s suite of active safety and driver-assist features like automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. This year it gets minor updates like standard dual-zone climate control on V6 models, and the introduction of special editions.
The Tacoma isn’t quite as fresh as its competitors, but it’s still the go-to recommendation for the majority of midsize truck buyers.
 2021 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab PricingThe 2021 Toyota Tacoma has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) that is as wide as its lineup. At its least expensive, a 4-cylinder Tacoma SR Access Cab begins at $26,150, plus a $1,175 destination fee. At the other end, a 4-wheel-drive Tacoma TRD Pro Double Cab starts at $46,780. The rest of the models fall between this $20,000 price differential. A mid-trim Tacoma TRD Sport or Off-Road model will begin in the mid-$30,000 range.
These prices are in line with the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon and Nissan Frontier. The Honda Ridgeline and Jeep Gladiator both begin over $33,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying.
The Toyota Tacoma’s resale value is excellent. In fact, the 2020 model won the Best Resale Value Award for midsize trucks.

Driving the  2021 Toyota Tacoma Access CabFor most drivers, the Tacoma’s 159-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder base engine can get the job done, but don’t look for stellar passing power when towing or climbing steep grades. While at first glance, fuel-economy figures may seem attractive, they’re not all that much better than what the V6 delivers. This leads us to suggest that if you can afford the extra cost, the V6 is the better choice.
With 278 horsepower on tap, the 3.5-liter V6 moves the Tacoma with brisk bursts of acceleration and also enables it to tow up to 6,800 pounds. The 6-speed automatic is an older design, but it gets the job done. We know that in today’s world, the manual transmission is seen as an oddity, but if you’re still a fan of three pedals, the Tacoma is the rare truck that offers one. And it’s a surprisingly good one. The 6-speed manual connected to the V6 is offered in all TRD models, and it’s a joy to use.
The cat-back exhaust in the TRD Pro models may sound cool at first, but it can tend to drone on longer treks. Thankfully this model also includes a premium audio system.
Seating is comfortable, especially with the new power-adjustable seat, and the cabin logically arranged with all the most important switchgear within easy reach. We found the Tacoma’s ride firm but not nearly as jarring as the Ford Ranger. The steering is impressively responsive. We do think the Tacoma’s steering-wheel-and-pedal placement may prove challenging for drivers with long legs, but otherwise, we have no gripes with the cabin layout.
Interior ComfortDepending on cab configuration, the Tacoma seats either four or five passengers. Access Cab models have just two small rear seats. If you plan to use the Tacoma as a family vehicle or to regularly accommodate rear-seat passengers, you’ll want the Double Cab. This provides a roomy bench seat that can accommodate three passengers and has plenty of legroom.
As is Toyota’s tradition, build quality in the 2021 Tacoma is excellent. The interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats, and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like, and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting.
All 2021 Tacoma models include a central touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and available in either the standard 7-inch or larger 8-inch variety. As we noted in Favorite Features, the 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat that’s standard on SR5 and above models makes a big difference in comfort and accommodating a variety of body sizes. Otherwise, base models retain the old 4-way manual adjust driver’s seat – with no height adjustment.
Exterior StylingNow in its third generation, the 2021 Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015. Still, we think the Tacoma’s design has held up well. Last year it got some new details, including a redesigned grille and a new taillight design. The SR5 and above have optional day-running headlights.
The Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old-school. It is available with either the smaller Access Cab that has half-size rear-hinged doors or the Double Cab with standard-size doors. Two bed lengths are available. All Access Cab models have the longer 6-foot bed, while Double Cab models have a choice of the 5-foot short bed or long bed. Note that even as a “midsize” pickup, the Tacoma is substantial. An Access Cab model stretches 212.3 inches, while a Double Cab long-bed model spans 225.5 inches. If you plan to park your Tacoma in the garage, take some measurements first.
Modern cues include LED daytime running lights, and the separate models — SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-road, TRD Pro and Limited — each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.
A new special edition for 2021, the Trail Edition, includes built-in lockable storage bins on each side of the truck bed. The one on the driver’s side can also act as a cooler thanks to its drain plugs for when the ice melts.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SAFETY SYSTEMS
Like other new Toyotas – and unlike this one’s GM competitors — every Tacoma includes a full suite of active safety systems. Called Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), it bundles lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.
10-WAY POWER-ADJUSTED DRIVER’S SEAT
Last year Toyota finally rectified one of the Tacoma’s faults, giving it a power-adjustable front seat. This 10-way adjuster with lumbar support is standard beginning in TRD Sport trims.
Standard FeaturesThe Toyota Tacoma is available in half a dozen main trims: SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, Limited, and TRD Pro.
At its most basic, an SR model includes 16-inch steel wheels, composite bed, heated exterior mirrors, 4-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and the TSS-P safety system.
We suggest stepping up to at least an SR5 trim. This level adds 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, leather-trimmed steering wheel and shift lever, 4.2-inch information display, more advanced tire-pressure monitor, keyless entry, fog lights, and auto-dimming rearview mirror.
TRD Sport models are even more recommendable, adding the V6 as standard, a 120-volt power outlet in the bed, wireless phone charger, premium audio with navigation, LED daytime running lights, and the ability to add more options.
Factory OptionsContinuing the trim climb, TRD Off-Road models include alloy wheels, Crawl Control and terrain select on automatic transmission models, and locking rear differential. Tacoma Limited models have leather interior, 18-inch polished alloy wheels, silver grille, LED headlights, power moonroof, premium JBL audio system, surround camera system, and blind-spot monitoring. TRD Pro models have their own special wheels, heritage Toyota logo in the grille and other special badging, leather interior with heated front seats, Fox shocks, skid plate, cat-back exhaust, and multi-terrain camera system.
Options vary by trim, and they can vary a lot depending on all the dozens of configurations available. They include the V6 in SR and SR5 models, 4-wheel-drive in models that don’t already have it as standard, power moonroof, blind-spot monitoring, and JBL audio system. Of course, there are many accessories available, too, from a tonneau cover to a Desert Air Intake (aka, a snorkel).
The new Trail Edition is based on the SR5 Double Cab, while the new Nightshade with its darkened aesthetics is based on the Limited Double Cab.
Engine & TransmissionPower for the 2021 Toyota Tacoma comes from a choice of two engines. Standard is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine good for a modest 159 horsepower. Power can be routed to the rear wheels (2WD) or all four (4WD) but only via a 6-speed automatic transmission. A better choice is the 3.5-liter V6 that offers nearly 120 more horses and a significant boost in torque, yet delivers nearly identical fuel-economy figures as the smaller 4-cylinder. You’ll also get a choice between the 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmission.

Excellent fuel economy, a proven safety record and standard AWD don’t hurt, either.","ConsIf you don’t need a 3rd-row seat, there are smaller, nimbler and less expensive alternatives than the Q7, including Audi’s own Q5.",49000,"Driving the Used 2014 Audi Q7Remaining true to Audi’s performance history, engineers gave the 2014 Q7 SUV’s quattro AWD a performance-minded rear bias. This means under normal driving about 60 percent of the engine’s torque is routed to the rear wheels. Still, even with this enhancement, there is no getting away from the Q7’s vast bulk and weight. The nimble feel of the smaller Q5 is absent here, although we found the Q7’s steering to be responsive and its body inspiringly solid. In fact, the Q7 delivers the kind of driver feedback lacking in vehicles like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. Audi’s adaptive air suspension is a worthwhile option for those seeking a smoother ride or towing heavy loads. Neither the gasoline nor diesel engines are short on power, providing remarkable thrust yet also remarkably good fuel economy.
Interior ComfortTrue to recent Audi tradition, the interior is where the 2014 Q7 earns its keep. The leather is supple and elegant, and the Dark Brown Walnut wood trim is a fantastic touch. The power front seats hold the driver just so. The second row provides ample room but things get cramped in the third row. With those back two rows folded flat, there is 72 cubic feet of cargo space inside the Q7. The split-back folding seats yield more combinations (28!) than you’ll likely ever need but demonstrate Audi’s determination to coax the most out of a platform.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Audi Q7 makes quite a statement visually. There’s no denying its heritage, with the raked windshield, huge grille and aggressive stance. The Q7 is all-Audi, to be sure, though updated body styling on its sibling Touareg and Cayenne models is making the Q7 start to look a bit dated. The S-Line Plus package’s trim additions help, but a redesign will probably be in order soon. Meanwhile, the Q7’s exterior, just like its interior, shows impeccable fit and finish and excellent quality all around.
Favorite FeaturesBANG & OLUFSEN ADVANCED SOUND SYSTEMWith 14 custom-made speakers from the renowned audio brilliance of Bang & Olufsen, the Q7’s optional sound system simply needs to be heard to be believed.
3.0 TDI DIESELDiesel power is wedging its way into the American market at last, and Audi’s TDI deserves some credit for that. In the 2014 Q7 the new turbodiesel engine is stronger, lighter and more efficient than before, and it moves the big SUV around energetically while returning surprisingly good mpg.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Audi Q7 is exceptionally well-equipped. The base 3.0T and TDI turbodiesel models (called Premium trim) feature rear parking sensors, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth connectivity, Audi Multimedia Interface and a power liftgate. The Premium Plus gets additional chrome pieces, a rearview camera, navigation system (standard with Audi Connect), and Bose Surround Sound system. The TDI Prestige package comes with 20-inch wheels and Audi’s Warm Weather package. Across the line, quattro AWD, electronic stability control with roll-over mitigation, and the full litany of airbags, including side-curtain airbags that protect across all three rows, are present.
Factory OptionsThe most notable option for your conventional gasoline-powered 2014 Audi Q7 is the S-Line package. Improving the feel and responsiveness of the 5,400-pound Q7, the S-Line package coaxes 333 horsepower out of the Q7’s V6 and includes a 3-panel panorama sunroof and the Warm Weather Package with 4-zone climate control. The Multimedia Navigation unit is available as on option on Premium models. Adaptive air suspension is also available, and will go a long way toward improving your Q7’s performance no matter what the surface and conditions.
Engine & TransmissionThe entry-level 2014 Audi Q7 is powered by a 3.0-liter supercharged gasoline V6 that delivers 280 horsepower, while the S-Line version bumps output to 333 horsepower. The 3.0-liter TDI turbodiesel pumps out 240 horsepower, but more important, its remarkable 406 lb-ft of torque available barely above idle makes it feel like a genuinely lusty powerplant launching the big Q7 from a standstill. Highway mpg for the Q7, depending upon model, ranges from 22-28, helped by the standard Tiptronic 8-speed transmission found in all models. Of course, Audi’s quattro AWD system puts down power in a stable, secure fashion.

In the crowded world of luxury SUVs, the 2014 Audi Q7 is truly one of a kind. Handsome, poised and polished, the Q7 not only delivers in the areas of pampering passengers and impressing the neighbors, its powerhouse engine lineup and taut handling make it joy to drive. Two amazing supercharged V6 gasoline engines and one turbodiesel combine with standard quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) to move the Q7 around smartly yet efficiently, in any weather, on any road. The Q7’s exterior styling is subtle but distinctive, with a wide grille and rounded corners. Unfortunately, that same styling creates a somewhat snug interior, most noticeable in the 3rd-row seat and rear cargo area.

Other feathers in the Toyota’s cap are exceptional resale value and an enviable reliability record.","ConsIf off-roading is not a priority, look to a car-based crossover SUV such as the Toyota Highlander and Nissan Pathfinder, which are more comfortable and fuel-efficient. If you want rough and rugged on a tighter budget, the Nissan Xterra and Toyota FJ Cruiser cost thousands less.",33680,"Driving the Used 2014 Toyota 4RunnerThough based on a truck chassis, the 4Runner is bearable on the road thanks to a compliant suspension that soaks up bumps. The SUV accelerates briskly thanks to its standard 270-horsepower V6 engine, and its 5-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly. It shouldn’t be a surprise that the 4Runner isn’t at its best on twisty roads – it floats far more than it carves. The Toyota’s steering can feel overly assisted in low-speed settings such as parking lots and is rather slow to respond, requiring constant corrections. The brakes also take getting used to, as they tend to be ""grabby"" after the initial, mushy depression of the pedal. At highway speeds, wind noise can interrupt conversations. Outward visibility is good even with the raised rear-seat headrests, which adds confidence on road and off. Concerning the latter, the 4Runner truly excels. It’s a blast to drive on rutted trails that would make most crossover SUVs whimper.
Interior ComfortAlthough still rather simple, the 2014 4Runner’s cabin is roomy and versatile. The Toyota’s large dials and buttons for everything from the radio to low-range gearing are a cinch to use. The large center console has an available 120V AC power outlet, helpful for charging accessories. The power-adjustable front seats are comfortable and supportive. In back, a 40/20/40 split seat offers numerous cargo/seating configurations and reclines. For larger families, 7-passenger seating is available in SR5 and Limited trims, though the small third row is best suited for children. Folding the rear seats yields a flat floor and nearly 90 cubic feet of cargo space.
Exterior StylingNot much has changed on the outside for the 2014 4Runner, and that which has may not be seen as an improvement. In an effort to give the SUV a ""more rugged and aggressive appearance,"" Toyota has endowed the front fascia with large, boomerang-shaped indentations below the slanted headlights. If that gaping design is a deterrent, know that it doesn’t apply to the top-line Limited edition. The rest of the 4Runner successfully carries on the SUV’s rugged, boxy shape. We dig the 4-wheel-drive Trail model’s hood scoop and additional ground clearance that totals 9.6 inches. All trims now have a roof rack standard.
Favorite FeaturesPOWER REAR LIFTGATE WINDOWYou can gain access to the 4Runner’s rear cargo space without opening the rear liftgate – especially useful in a tight garage or when someone is parked close behind. As a bonus, you can carry long objects such as lumber out the back window without fuss.
OPTIONAL SLIDING REAR CARGO DECKThis convenient sliding deck lets you reach your gear in the back, supports 440 pounds and is handy for your next tailgate party.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Toyota 4Runner is available in three trims: SR5, Trail and Limited. The base SR5 has, the new, 8-speaker Entune Audio Plus system with AM/FM/CD/USB player and Bluetooth music streaming, HomeLink remote transceiver, rearview camera, fabric interior and 8-way-power driver’s seat. Off-road aficionados will find much to like in Trail models, which include 4-wheel drive (4WD) instead of rear-wheel drive (RWD), water-resistant seat fabric, locking rear differential, and multi-terrain select with crawl control. Limited models add leather-trimmed seats (heated and ventilated in front), dual-zone climate control, a new 15-speaker JBL sound system with navigation, moonroof, X-REAS automatic-adjust suspension and 20-inch alloy wheels.
Factory OptionsDepending on trim, extras for the Toyota SUV include a 3rd-row seat, 4-wheel drive, Entune premium audio with navigation, and the helpful sliding rear cargo deck. Trail models can be equipped with the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which can disconnect the stabilizer bars to allow more axle travel to help conquer tough terrain.
Engine & TransmissionThe sole powertrain combination in the 2014 Toyota 4Runner is a 270-horsepower V6 mated to a responsive 5-speed automatic transmission. There are three drivetrain choices: 2-wheel drive (2WD) in the SR5 and Limited, part-time 4WD (SR5, Trail), or full-time 4WD (Limited) with a limited-slip, locking center differential. Towing is a strong point for the 4Runner, with an SAE J2807-compliant rating of 4,700 pounds. A not-so-strong point is fuel economy, with 2WD models returning a combined 19 mpg and 4WD models rated at 18 mpg combined. Thankfully, the Toyota’s V6 drinks regular unleaded.

With the new audio system, the ""party mode"" rear liftgate-speaker audio setting feature has bid adieu.
The 2014 Toyota 4Runner is among the last of its kind: a rugged, mid-size sport-utility vehicle that finds purpose where the pavement ends. While others such as the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer have transformed into car-based crossover SUVs that emphasize a refined ride and better fuel economy, the 4Runner is built with adventure in mind. This SUV is still adept as a daily driver, and with its outstanding reliability record and seating for up to seven, it’s a tempting choice for lovers of the outdoors and families that would rather camp in the mountains than shop at the mall. The trade-offs for the 4Runner’s off-road capabilities come at the expense of middling fuel economy and a rather truck-like ride.

Families with big needs might be happier in a 3-row SUV like the Audi Q7.",10000,"Driving the Used 2014 BMW X6 MTo say the 2014 BMW X6 has benefitted from years of BMW performance sedans and coupes would be an understatement. Big as it is, the X6 can take its rightful place next to the best 3, 5 or 6 Series car when the tarmac diverges from straight line to serpentine. The X6’s all-independent suspension and xDrive AWD (all-wheel drive) keep its oh-so-obvious bulk in check, and its impressive engine lineup motivates the X6 forward in varying degrees of hyper acceleration. If the X6 has one drawback, you’ll find it every time you go to fill up, which will be quite often as even the most docile xDrive35i barely attains a 20-mpg combined city/highway fuel economy rating.
Interior ComfortBMW excels when it comes to driver and passenger ergonomics and the 2014 BMW X6 is no exception. Rear-seat headroom could be better, but that’s to be expected given the X6’s low roofline. The view from the driver’s seat is not unlike that of the 6 Series until, of course, you try to view what’s behind you in the next lane. Then, the blind spot that is the X6 fastback profile makes itself known. To its credit, everything is well-crafted, and the tighter cabin dimensions convey an intimacy rarely offered in more traditional SUVs.
Exterior StylingBeauty, we’d agree, is in the eye of the beholder. With that, behold a ""sporty"" fastback roofline atop an SUV platform. With the end result weighing some 5,000 pounds it becomes hard to fully appreciate the execution when built on such a shaky assumption. To its credit, the X6 is less awkward than Honda’s Crosstour, but we’re damning the 2014 X6 SUV with very faint praise.
Favorite FeaturesXDRIVE ALL-WHEEL DRIVEFew all-wheel-drive systems are more capable than BMW’s xDrive AWD. Despite the additional hardware, the 2014 BMW X6 enjoys an almost-ideal 50:50 weight distribution. Even in the Sunbelt, the very occasional rain or snow will only reinforce your purchase decision.
X6 MThe M treatment is usually always a winner and in the case of the X6 it combines raw power and truly impressive handling with styling that is both distinctive and sensuous. An M3 is fine when it’s a party of one, but those with bigger needs shouldn’t be left out in the cold, and the X6 M ensures they wont’ be.
Standard FeaturesThose with a need for all-season mobility should enjoy the standard xDrive AWD, a system that has the ability to transfer engine torque thus optimizing control in virtually any road condition. Add to that BMW’s attention to on-road dynamics and an extremely rigid body shell, and you have the makings of a 4- to 5-passenger GT. An 8-speed automatic delivers responsive acceleration and efficient cruising. Of course, features such as Adaptive xenon headlights, 10-way power front seats, a 2-way power glass moonroof, Dynamic Cruise Control, and a 205-watt 10-speaker audio system are also part of the standard equipment roster.
Factory OptionsMost significant options are bundled into various packages, and include Active Ventilated Seat Package, Cold Weather, Premium, Premium Sound, Sport/Sport Activity and Technology. Given the BMW X6’s mission of combining all-season capability with sports-coupe demeanor, we believe one of the two Sport packages goes a long way in enhancing the X6’s sport-oriented presence. Among stand-alone options, BMW’s Active Steering enhances maneuverability at lower speeds, while the Chateau Nevada Leather (in red) enhances eye appeal at any speed.
Engine & TransmissionIn its entry-level xDrive35i form, the 2014 X6 benefits from the delightful strains of BMW’s turbocharged (300 horsepower/300 lb-ft of torque) inline-6. And despite wonderful performance numbers – a 0-60 time of just over six seconds and an electronically limited top end of 130 – the 5,000 pounds of the X6 will be felt with a full passenger and cargo load. Opt for the xDrive50i and you’ll enjoy some 100 more horses and an extra 150 lb-ft of torque, which is probably the sweet spot in the X6 lineup. The X6 M offers more go, but starts north of $90,000. The xDrive35i and xDrive50i are connected to 8-speed automatic transmissions, while the ""M"" makes do with six. But at 150 mph, who’s counting?

Read Full Review","What's New?The BMW X6 receives a few minor changes for 2014, chiefly the addition of a universal garage door opener and a rearview mirror with a compass as standard equipment on the xDrive5.0i. The X6 M receives standard carpeted floor mats.
2014 marks the final year for this version of the popular BMW X6 – an all-new model is scheduled to debut in 2015. Not that the current X6 is tired or outdated in any way. Far from it. The X6’s SUV classification should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as it’s not terribly well suited for off-roading and its raked rear end negates what could be a useful cargo bay. But, if you’re an urban dweller who prefers performance to practicality, BMW’s 2014 X6 has much to offer. Standard all-wheel drive graces a lineup comprising three distinct trims, including a 555-horsepower twin-turbocharged M model. You can wait for the all-new 2015, or land a 2014 now, either way we think you’ll be quite happy with your purchase.

It’s truly fun to drive. The fuel economy is exemplary. It’s full of nice features. The pricing is very affordable. It’s one of the very best subcompacts in the segment. Check it out.,"ConsReasons to pick a different car: The Honda Fit offers more interior room and versatility, the Hyundai Accent is nicely done, the Ford Fiesta has its own considerable charms. The subcompact segment is not without choices.",15000,"Driving the Used 2014 Chevrolet SonicIt is difficult to take the Chevy Sonic for a drive and not come back mightily impressed with the comfortable ride, the nimble response, the snappy handling and the overall level of composure and refinement. All subcompact cars are better than ever, but the Sonic stands out from the crowd and drives like something bigger and more expensive than the competition. Its available 1.4-liter turbocharged engine brings exceptional fuel economy and sprightly performance, but is somewhat quirky in its power delivery. The base 1.8-liter engine costs less, is available with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, and is in some ways a more pleasant driving experience. But, with either engine, the front-drive Sonic combines class-leading road manners with remarkable handling capabilities. If there’s a canyon road in your daily commute you won’t mind so much the ride to work and back. You might even look forward to it.
Interior ComfortThere’s a lot of fresh thinking inside the Sonic and we like it, starting with the motorcycle-inspired gauge cluster that’s unlike anything else on a car’s dashboard. Another strong point is that there are no weak points, no spots that look like they just didn’t quite care enough to finish it. A few things worth mentioning are that the cupholders are good but placed too far to the rear between the front seats. The rear seat is one of the roomiest in the subcompact segment. And we really liked the dual glovebox arrangement, which is particularly thoughtful for those who use a dedicated music player, with the USB port located in the smaller, upper glove box.
Exterior StylingThe subcompact class is full of exciting designs these days, with such standouts as the Ford Fiesta and Hyundai Accent. The Sonic is rather more reserved, but it also won’t be one of those love-it-or-hate-it deals either. And it does have its interesting details, including hiding the rear door handles in the black areas of the C-pillars to make the car look more like a 2-door, at least at the first, quick glance. Another thing in the Sonic’s favor: With the exception of the base LS trim level, all models have aluminum-alloy wheels.
Favorite FeaturesMYLINK INFOTAINMENTWith MyLink, customers can use their smartphones to enable music from popular apps such as Pandora and Stitcher. Later in the model year a navigation app will be added to the mix.
OVERALL ROAD MANNERSIn any trim level, the Sonic delivers a combination of driving dynamics that is more than just a welcome surprise in a subcompact. In the LTZ trim, it’s comfy and nimble, and in the RS it’s downright sporty.
Standard FeaturesAs either a sedan or 5-door hatchback, standard equipment on the 2014 Chevy Sonic LS includes a 1.8-liter engine, 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, Bluetooth, steering wheel audio controls, 4-speaker AM/FM/aux sound system and OnStar with a 6-month subscription that includes convenient turn-by-turn navigation. Power windows and mirrors are missing from that list of standard equipment, but that’s not unusual for base-level subcompacts. A full range of standard safety equipment includes 10 airbags.
Factory OptionsA fully-loaded 2014 Chevy Sonic includes leatherette seats, heated front seats, a moonroof, cruise control, and 17-inch wheels. Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment is available on LS and LT models, and standard on LTZ and RS. A premium 6-speaker audio system is offered on LS and standard on all others, while the LTZ with the automatic transmission comes with standard remote start. The RS trim adds leather seating, 4-wheel disc brakes, a performance suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a sport steering wheel. The available advanced safety package includes Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning, and the LT Promotional Package includes MyLink radio, a power sunroof and front fog lights.
Engine & TransmissionThere are two engine choices for the Sonic, each more than merely acceptable. The base 1.8-liter 4-cylinder cranks out good power and is entirely reasonable and pleasant. The pricier alternative is a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that’s sportier and makes more torque, and thus goes quicker, but has as its main advantage a 5-mpg gain in highway fuel economy. The 1.8-liter is available with a 5-speed manual transmission, the turbo 1.4-liter with a 6-speed manual, and both can be matched with a 6-speed automatic. In our experience, we found no reason not to like any of the transmission choices.

The 2014 Sonic subcompact is the next-to-the-smallest car to carry Chevrolet’s familiar bow-tie badge (the Spark is the smallest), but it offers capabilities and characteristics that far transcend its tidy size. Coming in sedan and hatchback forms, the Sonic’s fuel economy is equal to or better than those of such rivals as the Ford Fiesta and Honda Fit, its ride and handling go from comfortable and responsive to certifiably sporty and enthusiastic, and it comes with lots of features that are pleasant surprises in this price bracket, including streaming Bluetooth audio and the MyLink infotainment system that allows for control of cell-phone-enabled apps. Add in that it looks good and is priced very affordably, and it’s a winner.

If your off-road adventures require lots of ground clearance and knowledge of what a transfer case is, check out the Toyota 4Runner, Jeep Grand Cherokee or Nissan Xterra.",30000,"Driving the Used 2014 Nissan PathfinderThis latest-generation Nissan Pathfinder is more refined than past models. This is due in large part because the old model used a truck-based body-on-frame setup, which made it a capable off-roader but not the best for highway cruising. The latest Pathfinder feels more stable in everyday driving, and its suspension and stability systems help keep body roll in check through corners. Like the Murano and other Nissan vehicles, the Pathfinder uses a continuously-variable automatic transmission (CVT). Such transmissions don’t have traditional shift points, but Nissan’s setups generally do well in mimicking them, and this particular Xtronic version is nicely matched with the Pathfinder’s strong V6 engine. Front-wheel drive is now the standard setup for Pathfinders, with an All-Mode 4×4-i intelligent all-wheel-drive system available that enhances traction and offers a full-lock setting for use on rough terrain.
Interior ComfortThe Nissan Pathfinder seats up to seven passengers across three rows. Legroom is generous in the first and second rows, but the last row will be tight for adults. Seating material is cloth or leather. We’re fans of the charcoal coloring of either seating surface that is contrasted by white stitching. Thankfully, Nissan passed on the finicky, all-touch infotainment systems used by others. Here, you can easily tune the radio or turn up the volume with the twist of a dial. The same goes for setting the temperature and fan speed. Other features we like include a hidden storage bin aft of the third row, built-in tie-downs, and flip-out coat hooks.
Exterior StylingNo longer the squared-off utility vehicle it used to be, the 2014 Pathfinder is all windswept curves and rounded edges. A large, upward sloping grille and two large headlight housings convey toughness, but for the most part the latest Pathfinder projects a friendly image. Roof racks can add functionality to the Pathfinder, and an available dual-panel moonroof does a great job of opening up the cabin, even for 3rd-row passengers. With just 6.5 inches of ground clearance, today’s Pathfinder isn’t meant for hard-core off-roading. Hybrid Pathfinder models look largely the same as regular versions, only subtly distinguished by LED taillights and hybrid badging.
Favorite FeaturesAROUND VIEW MONITORThis available feature uses four vehicle-mounted cameras to take the stress out of parking. In addition to displaying a picture of what’s in front of and behind the Pathfinder, the cameras create a composite image to give you a virtual bird’s-eye view from above.
EZ FLEX LATCH & GLIDE SYSTEMThis Nissan-patented feature allows child safety seats latched to the 2nd-row seats to remain strapped in when they are slid forward to gain access to the 3rd-row seats.
Standard FeaturesThe Pathfinder is available in six trims (S/SV/SL/SL Premium/Platinum/Platinum Premium), with each getting its own roster of standard features. Spend the least on a base S model, and you still won’t feel like a pauper with features such as 3-zone automatic climate control, push-button start, in-dash 6-disc AM/FM audio, and 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. Climbing trims brings amenities such as leather seating, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, Bluetooth streaming audio, navigation, and a power liftgate. Top trims bring a 13-speaker Bose premium audio system, the Around View Monitor, 20-inch wheels, and a panoramic moonroof.
Factory OptionsAside from the option of all-wheel drive, most other extras for the 2014 Nissan Pathfinder come as packages, which themselves are limited since many of the trims bundle the features. Among the offerings are a tri-zone entertainment system, a panoramic moonroof, Bose audio, and navigation. A tow hitch receiver is also available for those who plan to haul their toys.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2014 Nissan Pathfinder uses a V6 engine that has a good balance of power and fuel economy. It can tow up to 5,000 pounds and returns up to 26 mpg. The sole transmission is a CVT automatic. New for 2014 is the first hybrid setup used in a Pathfinder. While it won’t attain the 50 mpg of a Prius, the Pathfinder Hybrid is estimated to average 27 mpg, not bad for a 3-row SUV. Instead of a V6, the Pathfinder Hybrid pairs a supercharged 4-cylinder gasoline engine with an electric motor powered by a lithium-ion battery. In all, the system generates 250 horsepower and can still tow up to 3,500 pounds. The regular and hybrid Pathfinders come in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.

Nissan reinvented the Pathfinder last year, transforming it from a rugged body-on-frame SUV into a more car-like unibody crossover SUV. The result was a vehicle whose priorities changed from towing heavy loads and finding precarious paths to meeting the demands of a wider audience seeking a comfortable, fuel-efficient SUV that can stylishly schlep the kids to soccer practice and still have room for groceries. Not surprisingly, the latest Pathfinder has been a hit. As a softened crossover SUV, the 7-passenger Pathfinder is one of the most competent models in a segment that includes the Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Traverse, Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9. The Pathfinder’s 26-mpg highway rating is among the segment’s best, and a new hybrid model promises still-higher returns.

The suspension has the compliance to deal with all sorts of bumps and bad pavement yet, on those curving mountain roads or even just freeway onramps, it has a level of firmness and control that keeps the Journey cornering securely and with a minimum of bobbing and weaving. The first and second rows of seats drew praise from their occupants, but the consensus opinion is that the third row is more appropriate for the kids in the family. The standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder is adequate but no more, and is the best reason for choosing the much more satisfactory Pentastar 3.6-liter V6, which is one of the best V6 engines on the market today.
Interior ComfortInside is where the 2014 Dodge Journey earns your appreciation. Upholstery is in quality fabrics or soft leather, and soft-touch surface treatments are generously applied. Select the available audio system with the 8.4-inch touch screen and Uconnect communication and connectivity choices, and you’ll be operating one of the industry leaders in intuitive functions. The 3rd-row seat folds flush, the 2nd-row seats can slide fore-and-aft, and the higher trim levels feature a flat-folding front passenger seat that allows stowing extra-long cargo items all the way up to the instrument panel.
Exterior StylingIs it an SUV or the reincarnation of a station wagon? With the 2014 Dodge Journey, its long profile exceeds the length of much of the competition, but the Dodge designers have cleverly given it exterior treatments, such as the chrome-trimmed crosshair grille and some eye-catching aluminum-alloy wheel choices, that keep it from being merely bland. If a more stylish look is important, opt for the R/T version, with its 19-inch wheels, monochromatic treatment and distinctive R/T labels.
Favorite FeaturesFLIP ‘N STOW STORAGEThe 2014 Dodge Journey’s front passenger-seat cushion flips forward to expose a big storage bin that can hide valuables from prying eyes, or just keep things in place.
3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6 ENGINESmooth and responsive, the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine cranks out 283-horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque and is its own best reason for choosing it for the Journey. It’s matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission that shifts smoothly and doesn’t “hunt” for gears in uneven terrain.
Standard FeaturesStandard equipment on the 2014 Dodge Journey includes a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with 4-speed automatic transmission, power heated side mirrors, three 12-volt outlets, a 4.3-inch touch-screen AM/FM radio with a single-CD player, an audio input jack and USB port, keyless entry, push-button start, 17-inch wheels, 2nd-row in-floor storage and a covered storage bin in the rear cargo area.

Engine & TransmissionIntended for commuting and gasoline mileage, the standard 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine in the 2014 Dodge Journey provides adequate power when lightly loaded, but no more than that. Bigger loads, all-wheel-drive and enhanced driver enjoyment call for the potent 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, which makes 283 horsepower, 260 lb-ft of torque and is not only the engine many people will want, it’s our recommendation. Matched with the smooth 6-speed automatic transmission, the 3.6-liter V6 never fails to deliver power when asked and, once up to speed, keeps the Journey moving with remarkable fuel efficiency, being EPA-rated at 17 and 25 mpg, city/highway, with front drive and dropping only to 16 and 24 mpg with all-wheel drive.

The midsize 2014 Dodge Journey crossover SUV is where versatility and interior space meet with a modest budget and decent fuel economy. Prospective buyers will be attracted to its interior, which is full of clever and handy storage spaces, including under-floor compartments beneath the 2nd-row seats and a front passenger-seat bottom cushion that lifts to access yet more space for odds and ends. A big plus is the Journey’s optional 3.6-liter V6 engine, which is one of the best on the market and delivers generous power with smooth operation and noteworthy fuel economy.

At these prices, the Verano presents a very good value proposition in its niche market of entry-level luxury vehicles. An Acura ILX 4-door sedan, by comparison, starts closer to $27,000, while a base Lexus CT 200h is over $8,000 beyond the Buick’s starting price. The 2-door BMW 1 Series Coupe, meanwhile, starts around $7,500 more than the Verano. Before buying, be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Verano. News is not so bright regarding the Buick’s resale value. Its long-term residuals are predicted to be far below those of the Lexus CT 200h, and slightly below those of the Acura ILX.
Driving the Used 2014 Buick VeranoIf there’s one word to describe the Verano, it’s ""comfortable."" That shouldn’t come as a surprise since it’s a Buick, but it is a significant distinguisher among compact sedans. Where other entry-level luxury sedans strive to be sporty, this one puts on few such airs. Its non-independent torsion-beam rear suspension may seem dated, but the setup works with aplomb to soak up bumps. The Verano glides over roads like a little cloud. Sound isolation is equally impressive. With the standard 180-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, the Verano’s performance is acceptable but not exceptional. Opt for the impressive turbocharged engine and you gain 70 horsepower while sacrificing only one or two mpg. The Verano Turbo is a zippy little car that can go 0-60 mph in just over six seconds. The turbo model’s suspension is slightly stiffer, but it’s still no corner carver. Brake response and pedal feel on our test car was mushy and subpar.
Interior ComfortLike its larger LaCrosse sibling, the 5-passenger Verano’s interior is appealing thanks to high-quality materials and comfortable seats. The two lower trims use premium cloth as the covering of choice, while the top two have plush leather. The driver’s seat is surprisingly bolstered for a car of this size. The rear seats are snug, though, and legroom is at a premium. We like the Verano’s standard 7-inch touch-screen interface, but its surrounding buttons and controls could use improvement. There are many of them – including the oddly placed engine-start button on higher trims – and they are not very intuitive.
Exterior StylingThough its architecture is shared with the Chevrolet Cruze, the Verano’s outer appearance differs significantly. The compact sedan begins with a ""waterfall"" grille, has sides defined by a gently rising beltline that give it a slightly athletic stance, and wraps up nicely with a tucked-in trunk. Being a Buick, the Verano carries on the tradition of the brand’s aesthetic ""portholes,"" placed atop the hood directly beneath the A-pillars. The standard wheels are impressive 18-inch aluminum-alloys. Turbocharged Veranos are the sleepers of the line, with just a subtle ""T"" badge on the trunk and dual exhaust outlets to indicate their extra muscle.
Favorite FeaturesQUIET CABINBuick says the 2014 Verano is intended to be the quietest compact sedan on the road, and we believe it. More than mere marketing lingo, its QuietTuning technology effectively quells unwanted noise and vibration.
TURBOCHARGED ENGINEPony up to a top-line version of the Verano, and you’ll get plenty of just that. With 250 horsepower on tap, Buick’s compact 4-door can effortlessly get up to speed on freeways and breeze past slower traffic once there. Better yet, the turbo power comes on smoothly and with minimal lag.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Buick Verano offers a host of features – some not even offered by its competitors – at a lower price. Base models come with 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/USB sound system with touch screen, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a rearview camera. Spend roughly $1,200 extra for the Convenience trim, and you get much more for your money, including blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning, heated front seats, and a power driver’s seat. Top-line versions bring an invigorating turbocharged 4-cylinder, leather, a heated steering wheel, and a 9-speaker Bose sound system. All Veranos include 10 airbags, stability/traction control, and automatic crash response as part of a 6-month trial of the OnStar communications system.
Factory OptionsMany desirable amenities for the 2014 Verano are bundled among its four trim levels. Those that are available a la carte include navigation, a power sunroof, and Bose premium sound. The sedan’s outer appearance can be enhanced with premium multi-spoke wheels, diamond tri-coat paint and a spoiler. Turbo models can be equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission as a no-cost option in place of the 6-speed automatic.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engine choices are available in the 2014 Verano. Standard on three of the Buick’s four trim levels is a 180-horsepower, naturally aspirated (non-turbocharged) 4-cylinder that provides adequate power. The top-line Turbo model comes, appropriately enough, with a more powerful turbocharged engine. Though smaller in size, the turbo engine has 70 more horsepower and makes the Verano much more interesting to drive. All Veranos are front-wheel drive. The base engine can run on regular unleaded gasoline, while premium is recommended for the turbo. Like other 2014 Buicks, the Verano includes free scheduled maintenance for two years or 24,000 miles.

Think of the Verano as a Buick, condensed. As the automaker’s smallest sedan, the Verano is easy to drive and maneuver, yet it offers the high levels of comfort long associated with larger Buicks such as the Regal and LaCrosse. The Verano shares its architecture with the Chevrolet Cruze, but distinguishes itself with higher levels of fit and finish, advanced safety features, and a cloud-like ride. Though not as athletic as an Acura ILX or as fuel-efficient as a Lexus CT 200h hybrid, the Verano and its topline Turbo version stand out in the entry-level luxury segment with their refinement and value proposition.

Families with big needs might be happier in a 3-row SUV like the Audi Q7.",10000,"Driving the Used 2014 BMW X6To say the 2014 BMW X6 has benefitted from years of BMW performance sedans and coupes would be an understatement. Big as it is, the X6 can take its rightful place next to the best 3, 5 or 6 Series car when the tarmac diverges from straight line to serpentine. The X6’s all-independent suspension and xDrive AWD (all-wheel drive) keep its oh-so-obvious bulk in check, and its impressive engine lineup motivates the X6 forward in varying degrees of hyper acceleration. If the X6 has one drawback, you’ll find it every time you go to fill up, which will be quite often as even the most docile xDrive35i barely attains a 20-mpg combined city/highway fuel economy rating.
Interior ComfortBMW excels when it comes to driver and passenger ergonomics and the 2014 BMW X6 is no exception. Rear-seat headroom could be better, but that’s to be expected given the X6’s low roofline. The view from the driver’s seat is not unlike that of the 6 Series until, of course, you try to view what’s behind you in the next lane. Then, the blind spot that is the X6 fastback profile makes itself known. To its credit, everything is well-crafted, and the tighter cabin dimensions convey an intimacy rarely offered in more traditional SUVs.
Exterior StylingBeauty, we’d agree, is in the eye of the beholder. With that, behold a ""sporty"" fastback roofline atop an SUV platform. With the end result weighing some 5,000 pounds it becomes hard to fully appreciate the execution when built on such a shaky assumption. To its credit, the X6 is less awkward than Honda’s Crosstour, but we’re damning the 2014 X6 SUV with very faint praise.
Favorite FeaturesXDRIVE ALL-WHEEL DRIVEFew all-wheel-drive systems are more capable than BMW’s xDrive AWD. Despite the additional hardware, the 2014 BMW X6 enjoys an almost-ideal 50:50 weight distribution. Even in the Sunbelt, the very occasional rain or snow will only reinforce your purchase decision.
X6 MThe M treatment is usually always a winner and in the case of the X6 it combines raw power and truly impressive handling with styling that is both distinctive and sensuous. An M3 is fine when it’s a party of one, but those with bigger needs shouldn’t be left out in the cold, and the X6 M ensures they wont’ be.
Standard FeaturesThose with a need for all-season mobility should enjoy the standard xDrive AWD, a system that has the ability to transfer engine torque thus optimizing control in virtually any road condition. Add to that BMW’s attention to on-road dynamics and an extremely rigid body shell, and you have the makings of a 4- to 5-passenger GT. An 8-speed automatic delivers responsive acceleration and efficient cruising. Of course, features such as Adaptive xenon headlights, 10-way power front seats, a 2-way power glass moonroof, Dynamic Cruise Control, and a 205-watt 10-speaker audio system are also part of the standard equipment roster.
Factory OptionsMost significant options are bundled into various packages, and include Active Ventilated Seat Package, Cold Weather, Premium, Premium Sound, Sport/Sport Activity and Technology. Given the BMW X6’s mission of combining all-season capability with sports-coupe demeanor, we believe one of the two Sport packages goes a long way in enhancing the X6’s sport-oriented presence. Among stand-alone options, BMW’s Active Steering enhances maneuverability at lower speeds, while the Chateau Nevada Leather (in red) enhances eye appeal at any speed.
Engine & TransmissionIn its entry-level xDrive35i form, the 2014 X6 benefits from the delightful strains of BMW’s turbocharged (300 horsepower/300 lb-ft of torque) inline-6. And despite wonderful performance numbers – a 0-60 time of just over six seconds and an electronically limited top end of 130 – the 5,000 pounds of the X6 will be felt with a full passenger and cargo load. Opt for the xDrive50i and you’ll enjoy some 100 more horses and an extra 150 lb-ft of torque, which is probably the sweet spot in the X6 lineup. The X6 M offers more go, but starts north of $90,000. The xDrive35i and xDrive50i are connected to 8-speed automatic transmissions, while the ""M"" makes do with six. But at 150 mph, who’s counting?

2014 marks the final year for this version of the popular BMW X6 – an all-new model is scheduled to debut in 2015. Not that the current X6 is tired or outdated in any way. Far from it. The X6’s SUV classification should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as it’s not terribly well suited for off-roading and its raked rear end negates what could be a useful cargo bay. But, if you’re an urban dweller who prefers performance to practicality, BMW’s 2014 X6 has much to offer. Standard all-wheel drive graces a lineup comprising three distinct trims, including a 555-horsepower twin-turbocharged M model. You can wait for the all-new 2015, or land a 2014 now, either way we think you’ll be quite happy with your purchase.

Both are easier to maneuver when parking lots get crowded and lighter on their feet when roads turn twisty.",30495,"Driving the Used 2014 Ford ExplorerJust as the latest-gen Explorer shed its old skin for a more refined, contemporary image, and so it goes when you hop behind the wheel. The Explorer feels more like a soft-sprung sedan than a rigid truck because its underpinnings are essentially the former. This makes for a comfortable – bordering on lumbering – ride. Visibility to the front and sides is good thanks to a commanding view from the driver’s seat. But rearward visibility suffers from blind spots. We quickly became thankful for the wide-view mirrors and available blind-spot monitoring system. The 2014 Explorer’s base, 290-horsepower V6 feels adequate for routine driving, but has to work hard to move this vehicle’s 4,500-plus pounds up steeper hills. A lower-horsepower but higher-mileage 4-cylinder is available, as is a potent turbocharged V6 introduced in 2013 Explorer Sport models. Four-wheel-drive (4WD) models have the slick terrain-management system (see Favorite Features below for why we like it).
Interior Comfort2014 Ford Explorer models feature three rows of seats and hold six or seven passengers depending on configuration. Even the 2-passenger third row is livable for adults. The second row features a 3-person bench or, and for added comfort, can be had with two bucket seats. Both rear rows fold nearly flat to create a vast 80.7 cubic feet of cargo area, and both have power-folding availability. The large front seats are split by a wide transmission tunnel with built-in armrests and two of the Explorer’s eight cupholders. Seat material is cloth in lower trims and leather in higher versions.
Exterior StylingWhile not as boxy as past versions, the 2014 Explorer still has an athletic presence thanks to well-defined sheet metal that’s bolstered by bulges in just the right places. Of particular prominence are creases running along the sides just aft the front wheels that convey muscle and motion. At the rear is a one-piece liftgate. Below, dual exhaust tips lend a sporty look. Sport models are edgier with an ebony grille, darkened wheels, and headlights with blackout treatment. Wheels range in size from 17 to 20 inches.
Favorite FeaturesTWIN-TURBOCHARGED V6 ENGINEIntroduced in 2013 in the range-topping Explorer Sport trim, this 365-horsepower engine provides much-appreciated power to Ford’s big SUV while returning respectable fuel-economy figures.
TERRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMSimilar to the advanced system used in Land Rover vehicles, this feature enables drivers to optimize 4-wheel-drive Explorer models for snow, mud, or ruts with the twist of a dial.
Standard FeaturesThe 2014 Ford Explorer is available in four trims: Base, XLT, Limited and Sport. Just over $30,000 for a base version buys you quite a bit of vehicle with a V6 engine, single-zone climate control with rear auxiliary climate control and power driver’s seat. Standard audio is a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with aux and USB inputs. Walking up trim lines can net you leather, dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable pedals, and Ford’s Sync entertainment and communications system. Standard safety features include Roll Stability Control and Curve Control, the latter of which can slow the vehicle if it senses you’re taking a corner too quickly.
Factory OptionsDepending on the depth of your pockets, the Explorer can be a relatively basic people hauler or an amenity-filled technological thriller. Optional on V6 models is 4-wheel drive (standard on Sport editions) in place of front-wheel drive (FWD). The smaller, more fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engine can be had on all but Explorer Sport trims. Adaptive Cruise Control and blind-spot monitoring are available, as is a lane-departure system that can nudge you back into the lane should you wander. Rear-seat inflatable seatbelts are also noteworthy. The power liftgate with height adjustment is always appreciated when you’re arms are full. Rear-seat passengers can be spoiled with a dual-screen DVD system and dual-panel moonroof.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine choices reside under the hood of the 2014 Explorer. Standard is the 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 that is adequate for most peoples’ needs, but not overwhelming. Optional is a smaller, turbocharged 4-cylinder EcoBoost engine whose headline is a 28-mpg highway EPA rating. The top dog, exclusive to the Sport model, is the turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost good for 365 horsepower. All 2014 Explorer models have a 6-speed automatic transmission. Those with a V6 engine feature Ford’s SelectShift version that enables drivers to shift gears manually. The souped-up Sport model takes that notion further with paddle shifters for those instances you want to mimic a racecar driver. All engines can run on regular unleaded, though premium is recommended for the EcoBoost variants. Tow rating is 2,000 pounds for 4-cylinder models and 5,000 pounds for V6 versions.

Ford’s latest Explorer is a far different vehicle than those of the generations before it. What used to be a rough and rugged truck-based vehicle is now a sleeker, softer and more fuel-efficient crossover SUV. Gone are features like a 2-speed transfer case and V8 engine that enabled the old Explorer to climb mountains. In their place are more pragmatic features like a rearview camera and the MyFord infotainment system that help parents navigate school parking lots and keep the kids entertained once loaded in back. Like rivals such as the Chevrolet Traverse, Nissan Pathfinder, Dodge Durango, Toyota Highlander, and Honda Pilot, the 3-row 2014 Explorer happily accommodates families. It’s not nearly as nimble as some rivals, but the Explorer has an adventurous spirit and snazzy off-road smarts.

Driving the Used 2014 Honda AccordWith the Accord’s various powertrains come different driving experiences, but most buyers will gravitate toward 4-cylinder models with an automatic transmission. Used in this setup is a continuously-variable transmission (CVT), and it’s surprisingly refined. The Accord’s CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base sedan has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains up to 36 mpg on the highway. Ride quality in general is highly pleasing, with improved noise reduction vs. previous models. Versions with the 278-horsepower V6 are downright quick. Hybrid models offer an easy way to earn exceptional fuel economy. Their transitions from gasoline engine power to electric power are smooth, and the sedan is noticeably quiet when running on electricity alone. The only obtrusion we experienced from the hybrid models was a whine from the electric powertrain likely only to be heard by canines and human passengers whose ears can still sense higher frequencies.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Accord’s 5-passenger cabin feels familiar yet sophisticated. The familiar part comes from its roominess, excellent visibility and the fact that controls are within easy reach. You don’t have to hunt and peck to turn up the radio or fan. Among the premium touches are an 8-inch screen that sits prominently in the dash and relays audio, phone and navigation information. EX-L models and higher have a secondary screen for touch-operated audio and Bluetooth wireless streaming. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, and the rear seats are roomy for two adults (as with most midsize sedans, three in back is a squeeze).
Exterior StylingThe latest Accord sedan is curvier and shorter than the previous generation by over three inches, but it’s still easily identified. The coupe, too, has gotten slightly smaller. Especially appealing is the Accord’s grille with its classy horizontal bars and Honda’s logo floating in the middle. Sedans boast a low ""beltline"" where the side windows meet the metal. This is relevant because it improves visibility, especially for children sitting in back. Higher trims have premium touches such as LED brake lights and daytime running lights. Accord Plug-In hybrids are distinguished by an additional “fuel cap” above the front-left wheel where the charging cable is inserted.
Favorite FeaturesLANEWATCHThis safety system sees where your eyes cannot by way of a tiny video camera under the passenger-side mirror that displays what’s happening in the blind spot. LaneWatch – included in EX and Touring models – can be configured to stay on or automatically turn on when the right-hand turn signal is engaged.
HYBRID OPTIONSThe Accord offered a hybrid years ago, but it wasn’t nearly as efficient as today’s versions. The new hybrid earns up to 50 mpg. With the Accord Plug-In hybrid, initially limited to California and New York, you can drive about 13 miles on electricity before the small gasoline engine kicks in.
Standard FeaturesEven if you spend the least on a Honda Accord LX sedan, you’ll get a well-equipped car that includes an 8-inch color display with rear-view camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, 16-inch wheels, and a 160-watt AM/FM/CD stereo with Pandora Internet radio compatibility. Sport models add a power driver’s seat, 18-inch alloy wheels, and a slight increase in horsepower. EX models include a power moonroof and the LaneWatch system, while EX-L models gain leather, upgraded audio, heated front seats, and lane-departure warning. The top-line Touring model has a standard V6 engine, forward collision warning, and adaptive cruise control. Hybrid models include LaneWatch, LED daytime running lights and a 10-way power driver’s seat.
Factory OptionsExcept for choosing an automatic transmission in lower models instead of a manual, major options for the 2014 Accord are obtained by moving up trim levels. Among the most desired features are satellite navigation, the V6 engine, a 7-speaker/360-watt audio system, 18-inch wheels, leather seating, the multi-angle rear-view camera, HomeLink remote system, LED headlights, blind-spot display, and adaptive cruise control. Accessories for further personalization include a sport grille, underbody kit, rear spoiler, remote engine-starting unit, and illuminated doorsill.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines and three new transmissions are offered in gasoline-powered versions of the 2014 Honda Accord. The base is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that makes a healthy 185 horsepower (189 in Sport versions). The optional engine is a 3.5-liter V6 that makes 278 horsepower. In the sedan, 4-cylinder engines are linked to a 6-speed manual transmission or CVT automatic, and V6 engines are connected to a 6-speed auto. In the coupe, the V6 can be connected to a satisfying 6-speed manual. The Accord Plug-In uses a 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a 124-kilowatt electric motor. The lithium-ion battery recharges in less than three hours on a standard 120-volt outlet or under an hour on a 240-volt outlet. Electric-only range is rated at 13 miles, and total range when factoring in the gasoline engine is 574 miles.

Read Full Review","What's New?After an all-new sedan and coupe were introduced last year, only minor changes are made on mainstream models. The big news for 2014 Accords is the introduction of a regular hybrid model and a limited-production, plug-in hybrid variant.
For nearly four decades the Accord and Honda have gone hand in hand. What began in 1976 as a tiny, no-frills 2-door hatchback has grown into today’s full-featured family sedan and coupe. In the process it has set the benchmark for the midsize sedan segment, one that’s crowded by rivals like the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Ford Fusion. After reinventing itself in 2013 with a new design and more efficient powertrains, the 2014 Accord lineup expands with the introduction of two hybrids, a traditional version and another that can be plugged in to run on electricity alone. The additions further bolster the Accord’s something-for-everyone appeal, while a starting price of under"

If efficiency is a priority, diesel versions of the sedan and SportWagen deliver eye-popping fuel economy, and like the also-recommendable gas-electric hybrid, is fun to drive.","ConsThe sub-$18,000 price of the base Jetta S sedan is tempting, but that model still uses an anemic engine and lacks the features found in comparably priced versions of the Kia Forte, Hyundai Elantra or Mazda3. If all-wheel drive is a must, look to the Subaru Impreza.",18000,"What's New?In addition to swapping the 5-cylinder engine for a turbocharged-4 in most sedan models, Volkswagen has installed multilink rear suspension in all 2014 Jettas and introduced its smartphone-enabled Car-Net communications service. Jetta SportWagen models again carry over unchanged except for new LED license-place lighting, and diesel (TDI) models gain a rearview camera as standard.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this vehicle’s diesel engine is involved in a Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act issued by the EPA to Volkswagen for producing and selling 4-cylinder diesel cars that include a software device that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. The EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these diesel cars emit up to 40 times more pollution than emission standards allow. Recalls, investigations and litigation are currently ongoing.
The Jetta is Volkswagen’s best-selling vehicle, and it’s easy to see why. Available with a variety of powertrains that include gasoline, diesel and hybrid, a wagon body style in addition to the popular sedan, and prices that range from under $18,000 to over $32,000, there is a Jetta for just about everybody. The best news for the 2014 Jetta is a heart transplant that replaces the aging 5-cylinder engine with a peppy and more fuel-efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder, a swap that gives the VW a new lease on life. The mainstream compact-sedan segment teems with popular rivals that include the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra, Ford Focus, Mazda3, Toyota Corolla, Chevrolet Cruze and Hyundai Elantra, but the VW Jetta stands out with its Euro sophistication, and the sedan earned itself a spot on our list of the 10 Best Sedans Under $25,000 for 2014.
Used 2014 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen PricingThe Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) range can turn a Jetta into a sub-$18,000 economy car or a $30,000-plus sedan with features and performance nearing that of an entry-level luxury car. The Hybrid models range from about $28,000 to over $32,000. Those seeking a fuel-sipper can opt for a TDI diesel model, starting around $24,000. The roomier Jetta SportWagen starts around $21,600 and runs to nearly $30,000. In lower trims, the Jetta is in good company with the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda3, Chevrolet Cruze and Subaru Impreza, but can’t quite reach the lower starting prices of the Nissan Sentra, Dodge Dart and Kia Forte. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Jetta. In terms of predicted resale value, the VW Jetta’s is expected to be marginal to good, with diesels faring the best and hybrid models the worst.
Driving the Used 2014 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagenThe Jetta you experience on the road will depend on what’s under the hood. On the base end is the underwhelming Jetta S with its 115-horsepower 4-cylinder, while on the other is the invigorating Jetta GLI. With its 210-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder and sport-tuned suspension, the GLI might give its upscale cousin, the Audi A4, a run for its money. Combining the best value, efficiency and fun-to-drive dynamics are models equipped with the new 1.8-liter turbocharged-4 and TDI clean-diesel models. The former feels like a baby GLI, especially with a manual transmission, while the diesel models have loads of torque for quick off-the-line acceleration. Like other Jetta models, the Hybrid version is surprisingly agile. Its combination of a small turbocharged engine and electric motor deliver peppy acceleration while returning up to 48 mpg. Our main gripe with the Hybrid is its brake feel, which ""grabs"" too abruptly when pressing the pedal as part of its energy-regeneration system.
Interior ComfortFor a compact car, the 5-passenger 2014 Jetta has ample interior space. Especially notable is the amount of legroom in the rear seats and the trunk space. At 15.5 cubic feet, the sedan’s trunk is in a higher league, and when you need even more room the rear seats fold. Space is a big attribute of the SportWagen, too, which boasts an SUV-like 66.9 cubic feet with the seats folded. Design-wise, the Jetta’s interior could be called “minimalist-chic.” You won’t find the latest technology, but you also won’t be confused by a thousand buttons. Tuning the radio is easy, as is setting the temperature.
Exterior StylingThe latest Jetta is stylishly conservative compared to such design-focused competitors as the Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and even the 2014 Corolla. Indeed, compared to the many entrants in this segment, it’s the Jetta and Chevrolet Cruze dressed as the adults at the dinner party. Is that appealing? Depends whether you’re more Josh Groban or Bruno Mars. If you’re in the camp of the former, you’ll like the Jetta’s clean lines that we expect to age well. GLI versions increase the excitement level with a honeycomb grille, 17-inch alloy wheels, smoked taillights and dual exhaust tips. SportWagen models continue with their rounded look.
Favorite FeaturesTDI DIESEL MODELS Volkswagen is among the German automakers continuing to prove that today’s diesel engines are nothing like the sooty, sputtering versions of the past. The 2.0-liter turbodiesel available in the Jetta sedan and SportWagen – mated to an automatic or manual transmission – has power to spare and fuel economy of up to 42 mpg.
NEW TURBOCHARGED GASOLINE ENGINENo doubt we love the Jetta GLI, but its $25,000 starting price isn’t for every budget. With the introduction of VW’s new 1.8-liter 4-cylinder, Jetta buyers can now have similar turbocharged fun in models starting under $20,000. On top of that, the new powerplant delivers up to 36 mpg.
Standard FeaturesSpend the very least on a 2014 VW Jetta S, and you’ll get basics like air conditioning, power windows/doors/mirrors, keyless entry, 15-inch steel wheels, and an AM/FM/CD audio unit with auxiliary input. Spend roughly $2,000 more for an SE model and you’ll not only get a great engine, but cruise control, Leatherette interior with heated front seats and 6-speaker sound system with iPod adapter. SportWagen models come with Bluetooth, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel and 8-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with auxiliary input. Complimentary maintenance still comes with the Jetta, but it has been reduced by a year and 12,000 miles to two years/24,000 miles.
Factory OptionsAside from a 6-speed automatic transmission, most extras in the 2014 Jetta are had by climbing trims. Among them are sunroof, navigation system, VW’s new Car-Net connectivity service, push-button start, touch-screen radio, power driver’s seat and rearview camera. At around $30,000, top-line GLI and Hybrid models bring sparkling bi-xenon headlights, automatic climate control and Fender premium audio system. SportWagen models can be had with a panoramic sunroof.
Engine & TransmissionFive engines are offered among the 2014 Jetta sedan and SportWagen. Used only on base sedans is an underwhelming 4-cylinder connected to a 5-speed manual transmission or 6-speed automatic with sport mode. You can move up a trim to obtain VW’s zesty new 1.8-liter turbocharged-4, also connected to a 5-speed manual or 6-speed auto. GLI models use the most powerful engine in the lineup, a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that makes 210 horsepower, 10 more than last year. Its transmission choices are 6-speed manual or 6-speed auto. Hybrids employ a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and electric motor, and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Like the GLI, hybrid models require premium fuel. The efficient TDI models use a 2.0-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder connected to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. The SportWagen continues with the 2.5-liter 5-cylinder or the 2.0-liter turbodiesel.

If you take the longer, curvy roads just for the joy of it, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere.",21000,"Driving the Used 2014 Subaru LegacyWhile the 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines in the 2014 Subaru Legacy offer differing acceleration, the Legacy 2.5i, and 3.6R share the same suspension, meaning the ride and handling are fairly consistent regardless of model. We found the Legacy’s ride to be exceptionally smooth and its cabin sufficiently quiet. The boxer engine’s low center of gravity coupled with all-wheel drive make for stable handling with a slightly sporty edge. The 2.5-liter engine’s 173 horsepower provides adequate though unspectacular acceleration and passing, though its optional CVT works better than most and features a set of paddle shifters that allow manual-style gear changes. Fuel economy with the CVT is actually quite a bit better than with the manual, and you’ll get a more sophisticated AWD setup to boot. The 3.6R is, as expected, better at moving the Legacy, but with a sizeable penalty in fuel economy (18/25 vs. 24/32).
Interior ComfortThe spacious interior in the 2014 Subaru Legacy is elegant in both its design and function. The front seats are superbly comfortable and, on all but the base model, include one of the best driver-seat lumbar supports we’ve tested. Legroom and headroom are excellent front and rear, and split-folding rear seats expand the cargo space from large to huge. The thick tilt/telescoping steering wheel includes controls for audio and cruise, as well as Bluetooth. Gauges are stylish, legible and include a trip computer and fuel-economy gauge; Limited trims have an electroluminescent cluster with a proper temperature gauge.
Exterior StylingOther than wheels, foglights and, on all but the base model, color-keyed mirrors, there is little to distinguish the various trim levels of the 2014 Legacy. Unlike its Outback cousin, the Legacy sits low to the ground – a design that permits it to appear similar to any other family sedan but also somewhat limits its ability to engage in deeper snow. However, features such as the available windshield wiper de-icer (included in the All-Weather Package) solidify the Legacy’s winter-warrior credentials.
Favorite FeaturesSYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEHow can the Legacy’s favorite feature not be the highly-capable Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive? For many owners, who live in places where winter can dish out some real weather, this will be the primary reason they buy a Legacy in the first place.
EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSIST SYSTEMAvailable on the Limited and Premium trim levels, the Subaru’s EyeSight system includes Pre-Collision Braking, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure and Sway warning, and a pedestrian-detection system.
Standard FeaturesFeatures on the 2014 Legacy 2.5i sedan include all-wheel drive, a 6-speed manual transmission, 16-inch wheels, USB/iPod control and Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming. A 6-cylinder 3.6R version is similar, though with a 5-speed automatic and 17-inch alloy wheels. The 2.5i Premium models include the CVT transmission, All-Weather Package (heated front seats, heated side mirrors, windshield wiper de-icer), a 10-way power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and an audio system with 4.3-inch touch screen, six speakers and SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The 2.5i and 3.6R Limited trims add a power passenger seat, dual-zone climate control, leather seats, a 440-watt harman/kardon premium sound system, rear A/C vents and an electroluminescent gauge cluster with 3.5-inch LCD information display.
Factory OptionsThe Subaru Legacy options are clustered according to trim levels. The base 2.5i offers only the CVT automatic, while the Premium trim can be equipped with the 440-watt harman/kardon audio system, a power moonroof and rearview camera package that’s compatible with the audio system’s display screen. Limited trims offer voice-activated navigation with rearview camera and a power moonroof. Both Limited and Premium trims are available with the EyeSight driver-assist system. Subaru dealers also offer a relatively wide array of accessories including an auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a remote starter, all-weather floor mats, puddle lights and a roof rack system with numerous attachment options.
Engine & TransmissionThe Legacy’s 2.5-liter boxer engine delivers 173 horsepower, good low-end torque, and relatively smooth and quiet operation. Matching this engine with the literally seamless CVT automatic will produce the best fuel economy (24/32 mpg city/highway), but the 6-speed manual is a better choice if saving money is a bigger priority. The most refined engine choice for the Legacy is the 3.6-liter 6-cylinder, which offers strong acceleration and passing power, but with a bit less fuel efficiency. Manual-equipped cars feature a viscous coupling center differential that splits torque in a constant 50/50 front-to-rear distribution. Legacys equipped with an automatic transmission use a more sophisticated electronic setup that, on the 3.6R, can even vary the torque split according to need.

The 2014 Subaru Legacy sedan is in a category of its own. Wrapped in styling that’s pleasant, if unexciting, its doors open up to a remarkably spacious interior with a very roomy back seat and a commodious trunk. It’s powered by a proven and rugged 4-cylinder engine that, matched with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) delivers noteworthy fuel economy. It also has high safety ratings, competitive pricing and commendable resale value. But what really sets the Legacy apart is its standard All-Wheel Drive (AWD), which gives it the capability to deal with just about any turn of the weather. If you’re looking for an all-around sedan that makes a lot of sense, it’s difficult to beat the Legacy, particularly for those who live in harsher climates.

A GT model comes in at around $31,500 and a GT500 at $55,400. Convertible versions add about $5,000 to the price tag. At its base cost, the 2014 Mustang is priced about $1,200 below a base Chevy Camaro and roughly $3,500 below a base Dodge Challenger, making it the bargain of the trio and even undercutting a 4-cylinder Hyundai Genesis Coupe by more than $2,000. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their 2014 Ford Mustangs. Resale value of the Mustang is expected to be slightly below that of the Camaro and Challenger.
Driving the Used 2014 Ford MustangThough it still uses an old-fashioned solid rear axle, the 2014 Mustang performs well on twisty roads and on open highways. As always, you don’t have to spend a bundle on a Mustang to have fun. Even a base coupe with the 3.7-liter V6 gives you 305 horsepower to play with. The standard 6-speed manual transmission feels satisfying, and the hill-start control works well in preventing the car from rolling backward when you let off the brake and engage the clutch. A 6-speed automatic is optional except in the fire-breathing Shelby GT500. Road noise is plenty apparent on rougher roads. Steering effort and feel can be set to sport, comfort and standard modes, a nifty trick. Rear visibility in coupe models isn’t great, but it’s better than that of the Chevy Camaro.
Interior ComfortThe 2014 Ford Mustang’s cabin is cozy and comfortable for a performance car. Soft-touch surfaces lend a more premium feel, offsetting the impression of swaths of flat surfaces and plastic panels. Recaro racing-style seats are available, but even the standard front seats are nicely supportive. The two rear seats look appealing with their deep sculpting, but legroom and headroom are very tight for normal-size adults. Think of the back seats as handy stowage space. Controls are logically arrayed and easy to use. In the Premium and GT500 models, the Electronics Package adds an 8-inch color touch screen and navigation system.
Exterior StylingNot looking a whole lot different from prior years is one of the things that keep the Ford Mustang iconic. For 2014, the Mustang gets some new paint colors. The front and rear treatments introduced last year, including high-intensity-discharge headlight and LED taillights, carry on. Along the sides, body-color rocker panels make the car look more cohesive. For those who like to let the outside in, base V6 and GT V8 models can be had as convertibles, and the coupe offers an optional glass roof. GT500 models have quad tailpipes and an aerodynamic front end.
Favorite FeaturesLCD PRODUCTIVITY SCREENThis 4.2-inch color screen in premium models sits directly in front of the driver, between the retro-style circular speedometer and tachometer. The screen works in tandem with the Track Apps software to measure performance, and displays useful information including fuel economy.
5.8-LITER SUPERCHARGED V8The Shelby GT500’s engine is a monster, the most powerful production V8 in the world, Ford says. Its 662 horsepower gives the car massive acceleration, of course, but also a menacing attitude even when flowing smoothly with traffic.
Standard FeaturesA base 2014 Mustang comes equipped with air conditioning, power windows and doors, AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary inputs, selectable steering feel, 50/50 folding rear seats (in coupes), and remote keyless entry. Higher-trim models add a 4.2-inch color information screen, ambient lighting, Recaro cloth seats, a Shaker audio system and universal garage door opener. Convertible models feature a power-operated cloth roof.
Factory OptionsMost extras for the 2014 Mustang are bundled in packages specific to trim. Among the options available are heated front seats, leather trim, voice-activated navigation, side scoops, and nifty side mirrors that project the image of a pony on the ground below. Performance packages can further crank up the Mustang’s capability with Brembo brakes, stiffer suspension, leather Recaro seats, and bigger wheels with extra-grippy tires.
Engine & TransmissionModern technology makes power and fuel efficiency less mutually exclusive than they used to be. Mustangs with V6 engines put out 305 horsepower yet they’re rated at 31 mpg highway. The 5.0-liter V8 in GT models makes 420 horsepower and has a 26 mpg highway rating. The King of the Hill Shelby GT500 with its supercharged 5.8-liter V8 makes an unbelievable 662 horsepower, yet still gets a pretty thrifty 15/24 EPA rating. The standard transmission for V6 and GT is a 6-speed manual, with a 6-speed automatic option. The Shelby GT500 uses a heavy-duty Tremec 6-speed manual. All Mustangs are rear-wheel drive and have a traction-control system.

The Boss 302 model is dropped and the Shelby GT500’s horsepower rating climbs to 662 (previously the temporary “over-rev” spec).
One more model year before a complete makeover to celebrate its 50th anniversary: That’s the story for the 2014 Ford Mustang. Almost nothing changes this year for the original ponycar, that iconic symbol of affordable performance that blends modern efficiency with a strong 1960s-America vibe.

The 310-horsepower, 4.6-liter V8 is totally adequate for lighter duties, while the 381-horsepower, 5.7-liter V8 is up for almost any task (yes, it even pulled the Space Shuttle over a bridge). The 270-horsepower V6 has acceptable performance in regular-cab models, but its capability declines with the added weight of double-cab setups. On the highway, the Tundra scores points with its quiet cabin. This half-ton truck isn’t exactly nimble, but it drives smaller than its dimensions otherwise suggest. The Tundra’s 6-speed automatic transmission on V8 models is smooth, though not as buttery at Ram’s new 8-speed. The Tundra does not offer a locking rear differential, but the big truck had no traction problems in our tests in which we drove a 4-wheel-drive TRD edition up muddy embankments, crawled down steep hills and waded through several feet of water.
Interior ComfortThe most notable differences in the new Tundra come on the inside. The truck’s big knobs remain (easier to use with gloved hands), but the controls and layout are sleeker. They’re also within easier reach of the driver. To be exact, controls for audio and climate functions have been moved 2.6 inches closer. Regular-cab models seat three passengers across, while the 2-row double cab and even larger CrewMax 4-door models seat five or six passengers, depending on whether the front is configured for a bench or two bucket seats. A helpful feature from the past model that did not find its way into this one is a driver’s-side grab handle.
Exterior StylingThe 2014 Tundra is available in three cab configurations and three bed lengths. Regular-cab and double-cab models can be had with a standard bed (78.7 inches) or long bed (97.6 inches). The CrewMax has the biggest cab of the bunch and is only available with a short bed (66.7 inches). The new Tundra’s hood has been raised slightly and is better integrated into the grille. As with other full-size trucks, the Toyota’s gaping grille appears to just get bigger and bigger. At the other end, the lockable tailgate automatically lowers slowly to prevent the dreaded tailgate slam.
Favorite FeaturesREPLACEABLE BUMPER PANELSTreat a truck like a truck and it’s almost bound to happen: bruising a bumper. The 2014 Toyota Tundra features a 3-piece design for its front and rear bumpers that makes them easier and less-costly to replace should/when they get banged up.
BLIND-SPOT MONITORING SYSTEMDriving a big truck means dealing with a wider zone in which you can miss spotting other vehicles to the rear left and rear right. Sedans have been offering electronic monitoring of these areas for years, but Toyota claims the title of being first to bring the technology to a full-size truck.
Standard FeaturesLike most of its competitors, the Tundra spans from basic work truck to leather-laden luxo hauler. Spend the least on an SR model and you’ll get power windows, cruise control, and Toyota’s Entune 6.1-inch touch-screen audio system, a USB port, Bluetooth and a backup camera. The more popular SR5 brings a manual sliding rear window and a high-resolution 7-inch touch-screen display with HD Radio and Traffic. Limited models add navigation, dual-zone climate control and leather with power-operated and heated front bucket seats. Premium and 1794 Edition trims use plusher leather like that found in the Lexus LS, heated and ventilated front seats, a moonroof and JBL premium audio.
Factory OptionsMost extras for the 2014 Tundra are bundled into trims. Those that are available as options include a segment-exclusive blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, power-operated tow mirrors, running boards and a deck rail system with tie-down cleats. The TRD Off-Road Package brings Bilstein shock absorbers and skidplates to further protect the engine and fuel tank.
Engine & TransmissionThree engines are available in the 2014 Tundra. The base 4.0-liter V6 is standard in SR rear-wheel-drive regular cab and double-cab configurations. It is connected to a 5-speed automatic transmission. A 4.6-liter V8 is standard in both rear-wheel-drive and 4-wheel-drive SR5 models. The most powerful engine in the Tundra’s stable is the 5.7-liter V8 that is standard in the Limited trim and up, and available all the way down to base regular cab models for those who want to take advantage of the truck’s 10,400-pound tow rating. Both V8s are connected to a 6-speed automatic. All Tundra engines run on regular gasoline, and the thirsty 5.7-liter is E85-capable.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Tundra has been significantly updated for 2014 with a more ergonomic interior and a freshened exterior that includes a higher hood and replaceable bumper panels. The Western-themed 1794 Edition joins the top-line Platinum model. Its name is derived from the founding date of the Texas ranch where the truck’s factory now resides.
The Tundra is Toyota’s entry in the full-size truck market, a segment long dominated by GM, Ram and America’s best-selling vehicle, the Ford F-150. For now, the revamped 2014 Tundra remains competitive, especially when fitted with a 5.7-liter V8. But in today’s world, power isn’t all that makes a model king. Even among full-size trucks, fuel efficiency is becoming just as important as firepower. And this is where the Tundra’s luster fades. For its 2014 update, Toyota did little to address the Tundra’s aging and thirsty engines. While competitors introduce potent V6 powerplants and 8-speed transmissions, the Tundra soldiers on with the same powertrains. The truck remains a workhorse with stellar resale value, but faces an uphill battle, especially with an all-new F-150 around the corner.

A look at the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price shows the typical transaction price paid for an Armada in your area, so be sure to check it out before you begin negotiations. Also be sure to check the Incentives tab to see what deals the manufacturer may be offering. In the all-important world of resale, the 2013 Nissan Armada SUV is projected to retain an average residual value, slightly lower than the 2012 Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition, and well below the value retained by the Toyota Sequoia.
Driving the Used 2013 Nissan ArmadaThe 2013 Nissan Armada SUV’s hefty bulk and truck-like build might have you thinking that handling and ride comfort are not going to be its strongest attributes, and you would be half right. Nissan’s adept double-wishbone suspension and speed-sensitive power steering make the Armada as easy to operate as a mid-size Nissan Pathfinder. Tight confines are still a bit tricky given the Nissan Armada’s length, but its short front and rear overhangs make maneuvering in tight corners a bit less worrisome. On smooth pavement, the Armada sails along with little drama, but upon encountering rough seas like uneven pavement or large expansion joints, the Armada’s Titan-based roots quickly make themselves – and the offending road surfaces – known. The 2013 Nissan Armada SUV’s 317-horsepower V8 engine delivers great power and never feels tepid or short of breath, and its 5-speed automatic delivers decisive, nearly imperceptible shifts.
Interior ComfortNissan’s 2013 Armada’s interior is designed to adapt to multiple needs, able to shuttle up to eight passengers, or just two people and 97 cubic feet worth of their stuff. The Armada’s second row can be outfitted with either a 3-person bench seat or a pair of Captain’s-chair-style seats divided by a removable center console creating a clear and easy pathway for the 3rd-row passengers to enter and exit. Passengers in the Armada SUV’s 3rd-row seat have a slightly elevated perch designed to give them an equally good view ahead as well as make the area feel less claustrophobic.
Exterior StylingNissan took a bit of a risk with the 2013 Armada SUV. Expressive body arches and door frames stand out from the 90-degree-angle designs expressed on the Armada’s competitors, as do its raised roof and enormous side fender flares. Nissan’s 3-opening chrome grille so familiar on their truck line is present on the Armada SUV as well, adding a bit of ruggedness on an otherwise luxurious SUV. Some of the styling cues actually hinder functionality, such as the high-mounted rear door handles that can be difficult for little kids to reach.

The SL adds Intelligent Key keyless entry and start, leather seating, RearView Monitor, Bose audio, power-folding 3rd-row seat, power liftgate, heated front seats and auto-leveling rear air suspension. The Platinum Edition includes all of these features plus heated 2nd-row seats and steering wheel, a power moonroof, a hard-drive-based navigation system and rear-seat DVD entertainment.

The Armada SV can be equipped with the Driver Package that adds a 12-speaker Bose audio system, Bluetooth, power liftgate, RearView Monitor, fog lights and a power-folding 3rd-row seat. Also available on the SV is the Tow Package and a number of dealer-installed options. The Nissan Armada SL and SV can be equipped with a rear-seat DVD entertainment system and to the SL, a power moonroof, while the Platinum Edition offers 2nd-row captain’s-chair seating. All models offer the option of 4-wheel drive.

Virtually all competing automakers – most notably Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Lexus – have tried to match (or surpass) its beautifully balanced dynamics, upscale image and enthusiast appeal with luxosport compacts of their own, and some have come close. But none so far has quite bulls-eyed that elusive target. Making that challenge even more difficult is the 2013 addition of available xDrive all-wheel drive (AWD), a still-quick but more fuel-efficient ActiveHybrid 3 model and (soon) a sports wagon. To make the nameplate more accessible to the masses, BMW offers a new entry-level 320i model that delivers 3-Series prestige at a buyer-friendly price. The previous-generation coupe, convertible and performance-based M3 variants are carried over as 2013s for now, but all-new versions on the new platform are not far away.
Driving the Used 2013 BMW 3 SeriesA major element of the 3 Series’ appeal is its grin-inducing driving dynamics. We’ve tested the sedans and coupes on slow, fast, twisty and hilly roads and on challenging race courses, and they go, steer, corner and brake as well as, or better than, anything in their segment. Especially impressive is the balance of cornering prowess with comfortable ride. The fuel-saving stop-start feature shutters when it kills the engine at rest, and again when it restarts as the brake is released, but it can be switched off. The delightfully torquey turbo-6 is good for 5.4-second 0-60 bursts, but the surprising turbo-4 is only about a half-second slower, with the down-powered 320i version turning in a time of roughly 7.1 seconds. As a bonus, the twin-scroll turbo used on both powerplants are virtually free of turbo lag. But if the standard variety fails to arouse your senses, the 414-horsepower M3 is sure to plaster a smile on the face of even the most discerning enthusiast.
Interior ComfortBMW calls its 2013 3 Series interior ""straight out of the BMW design handbook,"" meaning an uncomplicated look with tight fits, simple shapes and upscale materials. The cockpit, angled toward the driver by seven degrees, presents important controls within easy reach, and the rear cabin is a bit roomier than before. The four circular dials are speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge and oil temperature – but there’s no coolant-temperature or oil-pressure gauge. The console-mounted iDrive controller is handy to both driver and front passenger, and its freestanding central screen boasts a flat-TV-like trans-reflective, high-resolution display.
Exterior StylingWhen BMW’s 1977 3 Series replaced the respected but ungainly 2002, its styling was a pleasant surprise. Thirty-six years later, its evolving design has never again surprised, and that’s a good thing. Line up all six generations, and the evolution is apparent. Each new 3 Series logically follows the one before it, remaining conservative but contemporary for its time. Even to the casual observer, there is never a doubt what it is. Today’s slightly longer and taller model differentiates itself mostly by adding more character lines and creases and visually connecting its headlamps to its signature twin-kidney grille. Similarly, the equally-iconic M3 maintains its long-standing tradition of elevating the 3 Series’ athletic looks to the next level by way of distinctive front and rear fascias, quad exhaust outlets, and a wider, more aggressive stance.
Favorite FeaturesBMW PARKING ASSISTANTThis feature helps you to maneuver into parallel parking spaces by first measuring a potential space’s size to be sure the car will comfortably fit, then automatically steering into it. The driver just has to operate the accelerator and brake and keep an eye on the area around the car.
SURROUND VIEW SYSTEMCameras in the outside mirrors provide a bird’s-eye top view of the area around the car to aid maneuvering in tight spaces, while the selectable Side View function uses cameras in the sides of the front bumper to monitor traffic crossing in front of the car.
Standard FeaturesAs expected, 2013 BMW 3 Series sedans come well equipped with Leatherette upholstery, automatic climate control, cruise control, a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel, halogen head- and fog lamps with automatic headlight control, rain-sensing wipers, adaptive brake lights, run-flat all-season tires on 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, and a 9-speaker audio system with HD Radio and a USB port. Still, a power driver seat and a fold-down rear seat are extra-cost options. Standard Driving Dynamics Control offers ECO-PRO, Comfort and Sport settings, while standard safety features include stability and traction controls, anti-lock braking, active head restraints and eight airbags.
Factory OptionsThe 3 Series option list boggles the mind. Among the more interesting are a Parking Assistant and the Surround View camera (see Favorite Features), navigation with real-time traffic, Active Blind Spot Detection, lane-departure warning, collision warning and automatic collision notification. Available Comfort Access pops the trunk lid when you wave your foot under the bumper, Variable Sports Steering offers different steering ratios for varying conditions, and a head-up display projects key information in the driver’s line of sight. An M Sport package adds adaptive sport suspension, aero aids and M wheels, while three packages called ""Lines"" (Luxury, Modern and Sport) let buyers customize their car’s appearance.
Engine & TransmissionThree gasoline engines are offered in 2013 3 Series lineup: A 2.0-liter turbo-4 in 320i and 328i models (detuned in the 320i), the 3.0-liter inline turbo-6 (now available in nearly all BMWs) in 335i models, and a potent 414-horsepower naturally-aspirated V8 reserved for the range-topping M3. Each boasts the unique combination of BMW ""Valvetronic"" fully variable intake-valve lift, ""Double Vanos"" dual-cam phasing, and direct gas injection. Both turbocharged mills offer a choice of 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission driving the rear or (with newly-available xDrive) all four wheels. A 6-speed manual gearbox or a quick-witted dual-clutch 7-speed automatic is available on M3 models. Unlike its high-performance challenger, the Audi S4, the M3 is not available in all-wheel-drive configuration. The new ActiveHybrid 3 marries a 55-hp electric motor (packaged inside the 8-speed automatic housing and driven by a lithium-ion battery) to the turbo-6 for a combined 335 hp (not the sum of both peak outputs, since both engine and motor can’t operate at max power simultaneously).

Even the base Focus S feels comfortable yet confident and responds quickly and predictably to all driver inputs. Although ride compliance suffers a bit as you move up through the model hierarchy – and particularly on Titanium versions fitted with the optional 18-inch wheels and 40-series tires – the Focus still merits above-average handling marks across the board. Its AdvanceTrak stability control is complemented by a torque-vectoring control system that helps the Focus slice through corners with enthusiastic competence, and well-modulated anti-lock brakes (front discs and rear drums on the S, 4-wheel discs with the SE, Titanium and Electric) deliver solid, drama-free stops. While the Focus Electric does trade a measure of dynamic sportiness for its more overtly-efficient character, even this super-green sibling leaves no doubt as to its basic heritage.
Interior ComfortWhile not the roomiest in its class, the cabin on the Focus boasts the look and feel of a more expensive car, reinforcing that premium character with loads of soft-touch surfaces and an abundance of sound-attenuation materials. Legible instrumentation and well-positioned controls in all versions are complemented by an 8.0-inch full-color touch-screen that replaces the normal multifunction display on Titanium models with the MyFord Touch infotainment and navigation system. The rear seat is scaled for two mid-sized adults but decently padded for three kids. Folding the 60/40 rear seatbacks to a semi-flat position adds utility to the regular Sedan’s 13.2-cubic foot conventional trunk and raises the capacity of the Hatchback’s cargo area from 23.8 to 44.8 cubic feet. However, the battery pack puts a big dent in cargo space on the Focus Electric.
Exterior StylingBoth the Focus sedan and hatchback embody the latest iteration of Ford’s ""kinetic design"" styling language that gives each one a more aggressive and aerodynamic appearance. The look is effectively reinforced by a lower, sleeker windshield rake and flowing roofline set off by smartly-stylized headlamp and taillamp treatments. A relatively long wheelbase and generous front and rear track dimensions contribute to an even more planted stance. Filling its tastefully-flared fenderwells are wheel and tire packages that range from 195/65 all-season tires on 15-inch steel wheels on the Focus S Sedan to 215/55 tires with 17-inch aluminum rims on Titanium models. The top-line Focus Titanium is also available with an optional 18-inch wheel upgrade that includes 235/40 performance tires as well as a sport-tuned suspension.
Favorite FeaturesMYFORD TOUCH Standard on Titanium trim levels, Ford’s top-line infotainment and telematics package is based on an even more advanced – and now more user-friendly – application of the automaker’s acclaimed SYNC voice-command system and includes a premium 10-speaker Sony sound system, with HD Radio, media hub, in-car Wi-Fi access and more.
SUPER FUEL ECONOMY (SFE) PACKAGEAvailable on the auto-shifted SE 4-door sedan, the SFE Package includes auto-articulated, aero-optimizing grille shutters – an unseen mileage-enhancing element also found on most other Focus models fitted with the PowerShift transmission – as well as low rolling-resistance tires, wind-cheating wheel covers and a tasteful rear spoiler that collectively bring the car’s EPA highway figure up to 40 mpg.
Standard FeaturesEven the base Focus S sedan boasts an impressive complement of power assists, air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless remote entry, AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio, anti-lock disc/drum brakes and front, front-side and side-curtain airbags, while the SE – now infused with many ex-SEL features – adds SYNC with MyFord Driver Connect, cruise control, folding rear seat, 4-wheel discs, programmable MyKey and 16-inch tires on alloy wheels. The Titanium trim level has leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, push-button starting, SYNC/MyFord Touch, a 10-speaker Sony HD sound system, Sirius Satellite Radio and a 17-inch wheel and tire package. The richly-appointed Focus Electric features unique eco-fabric seat covers and adds voice-activated navigation.
Factory OptionsThe Focus offers an impressive selection of model-specific upgrades. While the 6-speed dual-clutch auto-shifter and remote starting lead an intentionally modest list on the S four-door, the SE offers a comprehensive Appearance Package (leather, 17-inch alloys, foglamps, satellite radio, rear spoiler and more) and a Style Package (custom-colored leather, power moonroof, navigation, MyFord Driver Connect and Super Fuel Economy, Winter and Handling Packages); all those options are offered on all but the SFE 5-door model. Titanium buyers can choose a 5-speed manual transmission, moonroof, navigation, the Technology Package (Active Park Assist, front and rear sensors, rearview camera), Style Package, Winter Package and a Handling Package with dedicated sport suspension and 18-inch wheels and tires.
Engine & TransmissionAll conventional 2013 Focus models are fitted with a naturally-aspirated, direct-injected 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that uses Ford’s twin-independent variable camshaft timing (Ti-VCT). This smooth, free-revver makes 160 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque and can be paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic. On the SE with Sport Package and Titanium models, the automated-manual transmission adds SelectShift capability via a rocker switch on the shift lever. Auto-shifted SE sedans with the mileage-maxing SFE Package rate a 40-mpg EPA highway rating but the economy star is the Focus Electric. With a 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motor energized by a 23 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, this ultra-clean hatchback returns a remarkable 105 MPGe combined rating from the EPA.

Confident cornering aided by nicely-weighted steering encouraged us to push the Optima sedan hard, and the electronic traction and stability controls always intervened when we pushed a bit too hard. The naturally-aspirated 2.4-liter engine develops an impressive 200 horsepower. This gasoline direct-injection engine is smooth, powerful and able to deliver 35 highway miles on a single gallon of gasoline. Whether it was passing slow-moving traffic or climbing steep grades, the 2013 Kia Optima’s 4-cylinder engine never failed to impress us. There is also a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine for those who crave more power. Equally as smooth and quiet as the 2.4-liter engine, the 2.0 turbo pumps out 274 horsepower, but is mated to the same 6-speed Sportmatic manually-shifting automatic transmission.
Interior ComfortOn upper-end EX and SX trims, customers can opt for such extravagant features as a dual-panel moonroof, heated and cooling front seats, heated rear seats and a voice-activated navigation and infotainment system similar to Ford’s SYNC. While we love the look of the 2013 Kia Optima sedan’s interior, some of the plastic on the dash and steering wheel still lack the quality look and feel found in Honda, Mazda and even some GM and Ford products. The front seats are pretty comfortable for tall folks, but the Optima’s sharply-raked rear roofline may cause some headroom issues for the rear-seat passengers.
Exterior StylingLooking a bit like something from the sci-fi movie Tron, the Kia’s 2013 Optima is a bold and original piece of work from the ground up. From its cross-hatch front grille and long sweptback headlight housing, to the weather-vane-style wheels on the SX trim, the Optima looks likes it’s going fast even when it’s parked. There is a duality about the Optima sedan for 2013, speaking to both luxury and performance all while masking its true nature to serve duty as a humble family sedan. Even base trims offer such nice features as heated side mirrors, chrome door-handle inserts and 16-inch wheels.
Favorite FeaturesEXTERIOR STYLINGThe 2013 Kia Optima sedan is one of the sportiest, most stylish mid-size sedans out there. We’d even put it up against the styling of some $40,000 European luxury brands.
TURBOCHARGED 2.0-LITER ENGINEWho needs a V6 anyway? This four-cylinder engine has 274 horsepower and an EPA highway estimate of 34 mpg.
Standard FeaturesEvery 2013 Kia Optima family sedan offers Bluetooth phone connectivity, iPod/USB audio connectivity, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls and a cooling glove box that keeps drinks chilled. As for safety, the Optima has an impressive array of features including six airbags and electronic stability control. Like other base-priced models in its class, the entry-level Optima includes 16-inch steel wheels and a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Factory OptionsOptional equipment highlights include a panoramic sunroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, Nappa leather seating, Infinity sound system, touch-screen navigation system, UVO infotainment voice-active system and rearview camera. In addition to a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, the top-of-the-line 2013 Kia Optima SX and SX Limited models offer a lightly sport-tuned suspension and more aggressive styling cues. The 2013 Kia Optima Hybrid features lightweight wheels in your choice of standard 16-inch or sporty 17-inchers, as well as the EcoMinder LCD panel with graphics and lighting that change to show when the car is achieving maximum fuel economy.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Kia Optima sedan doesn’t offer the option of a V6, and why should it? The standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder is nearly as powerful as some V6 engines and gets far better fuel economy. In fact, it has more power and better fuel economy than many other 4-cylinder cars in the category, as well. Those wanting more power can opt for the turbocharged 2.0 liter (SX trims only). Only one transmission is offered: A 6-speed Sportronic automatic with manual-shift mode. The Optima Hybrid uses the 2.4-liter engine mated to a 40-horsepower electric motor for a combined output of 206 horsepower.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2013, Kia has added a Limited model to the SX trim than includes Nappa leather seating, LED daytime running lights, red brake calipers and 18-inch chrome wheels. The manual transmission on the LX trim has been dropped, as has the turbo version of the EX.
The famous automotive leader Bob Lutz once said it costs as much to build an ugly car as it does a beautiful one. In the 2013 Kia Optima sedan, Mr. Lutz’s words have been proven spot on. Costing no more than a comparably-equipped Toyota Camry or Honda Accord, the Optima for 2013 outshines its competition with stunning good looks, compact car-like fuel economy, a great warranty and ever-improving resale figures. Add to the mix a panoramic sunroof and heated and cooling seats, and the Optima might appear to be the bargain of the century. Models range from the well-equipped entry LX to the luxurious EX to the fuel-efficient Hybrid. There’s even a high-performance turbo model that will shame some premium brands costing tens of thousands more.

Its design is rich but contemporary, tech options are category-leading and it strikes an impressive balance of around-town ease and at-the-limits poise.","ConsThe 2013 Audi A6 sedan is not an easy sell for hard-core performance fans. While a base BMW 5 Series offers an 8-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive, the entry-level A6 features front-wheel drive (FWD) with a ""gearless"" continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).",43095,"Driving the Used 2013 Audi A6The 2013 Audi A6 requires a lighter touch around town than a BMW 5 Series sedan. At the same time, it feels more athletic than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. But more than a meet-in-the-middle compromise, the Audi A6 satisfies on both the comfort and performance fronts. The available supercharged 3.0-liter engine is delightfully responsive throughout its rev range. The 8-speed automatic transmission is smooth and flexible. The rear-biased quattro AWD system effortlessly puts power to pavement. No matter the situation, driving the A6 is an exercise in ease. Wheeling into a tight parking space or charging a favorite onramp, this Audi never asks too much and always returns much more. If we could change one thing, we’d like better road feel and response from the fuel-saving but quirky electric power steering. Obviously, the sport-oriented S6 changes the equilibrium, with its lusty 420-horsepower turbo V8 and firmer suspension.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Audi A6 boasts not only our favorite interior in the segment, but one of the finest passenger cabins money can buy: an unmatched mix of contemporary design, high-quality materials and impeccable build quality. The A6 is also the choice in the segment for tech-lovers, offering dedicated Internet access that enables Google-powered maps and location information, and turns the car into a Wi-Fi hot spot for up to eight personal devices. The center console-mounted volume knob, placed conveniently adjacent to the main MMI (Multi Media Interface) control, remains a favorite small touch.
Exterior StylingThe sheetmetal of the Audi A6 sedan, completely redesigned last year, is clean and restrained, and very familiarly Audi. The profile of the car is remarkably similar to that of its predecessor and its A4 and A8 stablemates, but it still looks fresh, athletic and purposeful. Bright, crisp LED lighting options perfectly complement the modern aesthetic. Audi claims a remarkably low 0.26 drag coefficient for the A6, which helps the car slide through the air efficiently. Befitting its brawny, sporting role, the powerful S6 has identifying lower-body aero aids and a distinctive face.
Favorite FeaturesDEDICATED INTERNET ACCESSFor $25-$30 per month through T-Mobile, the 2013 Audi A6 gets its own connection to the Internet, providing access to Google maps and location data, traffic and weather information, and the ability to connect up to eight Wi-Fi devices, like computers, iPads and smartphones.
STOP & GO CRUISE CONTROLUsing video cameras plus short- and long-distance radar sensors, the 2013 Audi A6 will gas and brake itself along in stop-and-go traffic. All you have to do is stay awake and steer.
Standard FeaturesAlthough the 2013 A6 2.0T Premium boasts one of the lowest starting prices in the category, there’s not a single glaring omission from its standard-equipment set. It includes all the luxuries you’d expect in the segment – leather, sunroof, automatic headlights, seat memory, etc. – plus many of the newer niceties like keyless start (but not keyless entry), Bluetooth phone/audio connectivity and iPod/iPhone integration. Outstanding EPA fuel-economy ratings (25/33 mpg city/highway with front-drive) make the entry-priced A6 one of the best values going in the luxury class.
Factory OptionsThe 2013 Audi A6 offers an impressive array of comfort, convenience and safety technologies. In addition to all the benefits of dedicated Internet access, the A6 offers adaptive cruise control that can stop-and-go the sedan through a traffic jam. Audi Night Vision Assistant can detect nearby pedestrians on dark roads. A color head-up display projects speed and navigation information onto the windshield, close to your field of vision. Audi Pre Sense Plus monitors the road ahead and can warn of a potential collision. For this year, the parking assist system gets new top- and corner-view cameras.
Engine & TransmissionAudi’s supercharged 3.0 V6 is one of our favorite engines. With 310 horsepower and the 8-speed Tiptronic automatic in the A6, Audi says it runs 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds. The 2.0T standard engine delivers flexible thrust that will satisfy most drivers, though obviously, it’s working harder in this car than it does in the smaller A4. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) attached to the 2.0 in FWD applications remains an acquired taste: functional and calibrated for good fuel efficiency but not the stuff of enthusiasts’ dreams. The 8-speed Tiptronic automatic accompanies all quattro AWD applications, with both engines. Speaking of dreams, the 420-horspower 4.0-liter turbocharged V8 in the S6 launches the 4400-pound car to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds.

Read Full Review","What's New?All-new last year, the Audi A6 is little changed for 2013. Quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) is now available with the base 2.0 turbo engine, an economizing stop/start feature is added to the 3.0 supercharged engine and top- and corner-view cameras are available for the parking-assist system.
Audi is on a tear, with striking new models generating record sales. The 2013 Audi A6 sedan, redesigned last year, exemplifies Audi’s strategy of going after BMW and Mercedes-Benz by confidently sticking to its own path. While the BMW 5 Series has long been the obvious choice for enthusiasts, and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the preferred ride for those seeking more traditional luxury, Audi’s A6 strikes a unique balance: technology and design, performance and efficiency. Its engines – a 2.0 turbocharged four and a 3.0 supercharged six – are strong and efficient, its sheetmetal is crisp and distinctive, and its interior is as good as modern automotive cabins get. For a stronger bias toward speed, the family also includes the 420-horsepower S6 sports sedan.

ConsThe 2013 Toyota Tacoma pickup can’t tow as much as a full-size V8-powered truck, and its narrower bed won’t hold as much cargo. If you don’t need to haul that much and you’re looking for a smooth, comfortable ride, the Honda Ridgeline may be a more friendly choice.",18000,"Driving the Used 2013 Toyota Tacoma Access CabFrom behind the wheel, a 2013 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab pickup definitely handles more easily than a full-size truck, but don’t expect miracles. Around town it can still seem a little bulky and clumsy. Controls feel refined and responsive, and ride quality is generally good though some payload in the bed helps, especially if you’ve specified one of the TRD (Toyota Racing Development) off-road suspension packages. Smoother and stronger than the standard 159-horsepower 4-cylinder – and without much penalty in fuel economy – the 236-horsepower V6 engine answers eagerly to the throttle. Both the standard 6-speed manual transmission and the optional 5-speed automatic work smoothly. Some people may feel the front seats place them oddly low to the floor but you get used to it.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Toyota Tacoma pickup’s interior has a modern urban feel, with 2-tone gray or beige plastic panels highlighted with metal-look trim. The Tacoma’s front seats are wide and supportive, but the rear seats in the Access Cab are useful only for short trips and smaller people. (Seating improves greatly in the Double Cab model, which has a full bench seat in back with adjustable head restraints and under-seat storage.) Steering-wheel-mounted controls for the audio and available Bluetooth are a welcome touch.
Exterior StylingA new grille and front-end treatment graced the Toyota Tacoma in 2012 and, for 2013, they continue to help make this compact pickup look as brawny and tough as the domestic full-sizers. Choose the base truck and you get a simple work vehicle with black bumpers and plain wheels. The Pre-Runner displays the look of a rugged off-roader in a less-expensive rear-drive-only package, while the X-Runner takes the pickup to a new urban-street place, with lowered suspension. Build quality and finish are above reproach.
Favorite FeaturesSUPERCHARGER KITA factory-provided supercharger! The accessory kit increases the V6’s output to 304 horsepower and 334 lb-ft of torque (from 236 and 266). It has to be purchased after new-vehicle delivery, and be installed by a Toyota dealer to be warrantied (5-years/60,000-miles or whatever existing powertrain warranty remains). 
FUNCTIONAL BEDAll Tacomas feature a composite inner bed with built-in storage compartments and four rail-mounted sliding tie-down cleats. Very handy and functional.
Standard FeaturesThe 2-wheel-drive 2013 Toyota Tacoma’s base 4-cylinder engine displaces 2.7 liters and makes 159 horsepower. Other standard equipment includes air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD system, anti-lock brakes (ABS), front side-impact and side-curtain airbags, traction and stability control, tachometer, two instrument-panel powerpoints and rear mudguards. Regular Cab 4×4 models with the automatic transmission add standard bucket seats. Access Cab, X-Runner and Double Cab models include bucket seats with a center console, power mirrors, power windows and power door locks.
Factory OptionsMany options for the 2013 Toyota Tacoma compact pickup are grouped in packages, and not all are available on every model. But the list includes a 4.0-liter V6, 4-wheel drive, JBL GreenEdge audio with Bluetooth connectivity, Entune infotainment system and the SR5 Package, which adds color-keyed over-fenders and front bumper, chrome grille surround and a chrome rear bumper. Double and Access Cabs can be fitted with a rearview camera while transmission upgrades from the base 5-speed manual include a 4-speed automatic, 5-speed automatic and 6-speed manual. Hill-start Assist (HAC) is available on V6 models with automatic transmissions.
Engine & TransmissionBoth the 4-cylinder and the V6 Tacoma engines feature Toyota’s VVT-i technology (Variable Valve Timing with intelligence) that minimizes the compromise between low-end torque and peak horsepower. Combined with a choice of four available transmissions, 2- or 4-wheel drive, three cab styles and more, Toyota makes it easy to get exactly the pickup you want. Maximum towing and payload capacities are 6,500 pounds and 1,535 pounds, respectively.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Toyota Tacoma rolls into 2013 without significant changes after it got a mild facelift, minor interior upgrades and some new audio systems just last year. As before, some top-line options, including the JBL-equipped audio system and Toyota’s Entune infotainment system, are reserved for the V6/automatic Double Cab versions.
The Toyota Tacoma is America’s best-selling compact pickup and for several good reasons. It’s a modern, capable, high-value vehicle with few real competitors. The Dodge Dakota and Ford Ranger are gone, and the Chevrolet Colorado (and GMC Canyon) is aging and feels cheap. (A modernized Colorado is a year or more away.) That leaves Nissan’s Frontier (getting dated, and better as a rugged worker than a family transporter) and Honda’s Ridgeline (just the opposite; a car-based platform that is comfy but limited in its hauling ability). Only the 2013 Toyota Tacoma delivers on all the work and play expectations that make Americans love their pickups, and does it in a more manageable, fuel-efficient form than a full-size pickup while offering a wide range of trims, powertrains and cab configurations.

Dial their standard Driving Dynamics Systems up to Sport+ mode, and the transmissions kick down, the revs go up, the suspensions gets tight, and they begin to feel like smaller, lighter performance coupes. Capable of 4.6-second 0-60-mph bursts, they are as fast as you’d expect 445-hp cars of this size to be, and a small turbo step – not really lag – is the magnificent turbo V8’s only mentionable quirk. The 640i models’ turbo-6 is no slouch at 5.4 seconds from 0-60 and more fuel efficient, especially in ECO-PRO dynamics mode. Buyers seeking to err on the side of comfort might want to stick with the smaller 18-inch standard wheels and tires. The multi-configurable, track-developed M6 versions are as docile as you want them to be around town and on the highway, but fierce-cornering, performing and braking tigers when turned loose on a racetrack.
Interior ComfortWe appreciate BMW’s evolutionary if-it-ain’t-broke, don’t-fix-it approach to interior design, but we’d still rather ride in an Audi cabin. That said, we’re beginning to see more color, more premium materials and more interesting shapes in new BMWs, and this new-generation 6 Series might represent the pinnacle so far. From a practical standpoint, the coupe/convertible back seat is tight, but the trunk is surprisingly sizable, and the soft convertible top doesn’t use as much cargo area as a retractable hardtop would. The new longer-wheelbase Gran Coupe can accommodate five adults in reasonable quiet and comfort.
Exterior StylingWhile the 2013 BMW 6 Series design is evolutionary, it represents a major improvement over the outgoing models. This third-generation’s hood is long, its front overhang fashionably short, its roofline low and sleek, its stance wide and athletic, its face instantly recognizable and its high-performance M6 versions appropriately hunkered down and sporty. The new-for-2013 Gran Coupe joins the curious (primarily German) ""4-door coupe"" club to take on Mercedes’ CLS and Audi’s A7, and while it’s not as sexy as the actual (2-door) coupe, it’s nicely proportioned despite its 5-passenger seating mission.
Favorite FeaturesBMW PARKING ASSISTANTThis feature helps maneuver into parallel parking spaces by first measuring a potential space’s size to be sure the car will comfortably fit, then automatically steering into it. The driver just operates the accelerator and brake while keeping an eye on the area around the car.
SURROUND VIEW SYSTEMUsing cameras in the outside mirrors, it provides a bird’s-eye Top View of the area around the car to aid maneuvering in tight spaces, while its selectable Side View function uses cameras in the sides of the front bumper to monitor traffic crossing in front of the car.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 BMW 640i Coupe pairs a 315-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder engine with an 8-speed ""sport"" automatic transmission with shift paddles on its standard leather-wrapped sport steering wheel. The rest of the impressive list includes Driving Dynamics Control with ECO-PRO, Comfort, Comfort+, Sport and Sport+ modes, Dynamic Damper Control, adaptive LED Headlights that follow curves in the road, BMW’s iDrive central controller with Navigation and a 10.2-inch central flat-screen display, a rearview camera, front/rear parking sensors and four years of the BMW Assist Safety Plan with automatic crash notification and other services.
Factory OptionsThe 2013 BMW 650i xDrive Convertible begins with the 445-horsepower turbo V8 with all-wheel drive (AWD), and an available Driver Assistance Package adds Lane Departure Warning, Active Blind Spot Detection, Side and Top View Cameras, Parking Assistant and a new-generation Head-Up-Display. Among the many other interesting options are BMW-exclusive Active Roll Stabilization, Integral Active Steering, a Premium Sound Package, a Luxury Seating Package, an M-Sport Package and a range of ""BMW Individual"" appearance features that allows customers to tailor their 6 Series exteriors and interiors to their personal style.
Engine & TransmissionNever has BMW offered the 6 Series in so many flavors. The higher-output turbo V8 650i models will likely be the volume sellers, but the Turbo-6 640i models will appeal to those wanting lower prices and/or better fuel economy, while xDrive AWD will attract buyers in the Snow Belt. Both engines are upgraded for 2013, the turbo-6 primarily for around-town fuel efficiency, the V8 for higher power and torque, and both drive the rear (or all four) wheels through an 8-speed ""sport"" automatic transmission, manually shiftable via paddles on the standard sport leather steering wheel.

Alongside its luxury-sports sedans, crossover SUVs and 2-seat sports cars, BMW proudly offers high-priced, high-performance, low-volume 6 Series luxury sports coupes, convertibles and now ""4-door coupes"" for affluent buyers more interested in style and image than practicality. The first 6 Series succeeded the 3.0CSi coupe for 1977 and ran through 1989. The second generation debuted in 2003. For 2012, the Gen-3 6 Series raised the ante in style and performance, and for 2013 the coupe and convertible are joined by high-performance M versions and fastback 4-door, 5-seat Gran Coupe models. Offering turbo-6 or turbo-V8 power driving the rear (or all four) wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission (or the M models’ 7-speed DCT), they look great, go like rockets and handle at least as well as anything in this small-volume segment.

And though many of its competitors like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape can absorb road imperfections with greater poise, the Outlander’s lively handling characteristics are worth the small trade-off in ride quality. While the standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is right-sized for basic daily driving tasks, most buyers will prefer the available 230-horsepower V6 for heavy loads and spirited driving. Outlander GT models offer a unique piece of fuel-saving technology called Idle Neutral Logic that automatically shifts the transmission into neutral when the vehicle arrives at a complete stop.
Interior ComfortInside the Mitsubishi Outlander is a clean layout with clear, functional controls and plentiful storage space. With the rear seats folded, the Outlander provides nearly 73 cubic feet of cargo space. The versatile interior offers a variety of configurations for occupants and their gear, thanks to a 60/40 split/fold-flat rear seat that slides fore and aft and (on SE and GT trims) a small yet handy stowable third-row seat. The Outlander’s principal shortcoming is the stark, hard-plastic surfaces in the ES and SE models. They could charitably be called Spartan or functional but they just look low-budget.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 Outlander looks bigger than it is, with a stronger presence than most vehicles in this category. Credit its ""jet fighter""-inspired trapezoidal grille and bulging fender arches. LED taillights and available xenon headlights (standard on GT trims) help communicate a level of refinement while GT models step up the Outlander’s athletic demeanor with a pair of chrome exhaust tips and a black-out front-bumper insert that makes the big grille look bigger still. The wheel lineup ranges from the ES’s 16-inch steel wheels to the 18-inch 7-spoke alloys found on SE and GT models.
Favorite FeaturesFUSE VOICE RECOGNITIONSimilar to Ford’s voice-activated Sync system, Mitsubishi’s FUSE allows voice control of Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones for hands-free calling capability as well as streaming audio. The system also manages voice commands for iPods, including Genre, Artist, Album or Playlist.
FLAP-FOLD LIFTGATEAn SUV with good cargo space and fold-flat seating is great for accommodating cumbersome objects, but a protruding rear bumper can complicate the loading. Every 2013 Outlander features a unique tailgate-style rear bumper that folds level with the cargo floor, making it easier to slide bulky objects in and out.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander is offered in three trims: ES, SE and GT. Standard across the board is rear privacy glass, LED taillights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a 60/40-split folding second-row seat and auto-off headlights. SE models add magnesium paddle shifters, 18-inch alloy wheels, a Fast Key entry and starting system – the key fob never needs to leave your pocket or bag – and a fold-flat third-row seat. The range-topping GT models add a 230-horsepower V6 engine, xenon headlights and automatic climate control. Safety features include six airbags and active front head restraints.
Factory OptionsAll Outlander trims offer an available 40GB hard drive-based navigation system with real-time traffic, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones, and Mitsubishi’s FUSE voice recognition system. SE and GT models offer a technically sophisticated AWD system, a rearview camera, a power tilt/slide moonroof, and a 710-watt Rockford Fosgate audio system with a 10-inch subwoofer. The GT’s exclusive Touring Package includes leather-trimmed seating, heated front seats, and a power-adjustable driver’s seat.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander offers the choice of a 168-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with variable valve timing (ES and SE trims), or a more powerful 230-horsepower V6 (GT). The 4-cylinder engine drives through a continuously variable transmission (CVT) while the V6 is fitted to a manually selectable 6-speed automatic accompanied by steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. The base ES trim comes in 2-wheel drive (2WD) only while both SE and GT trims can be had with either 2WD or AWD. Regardless of powertrain, the Outlander runs well and has a spirited, sporty feel, though fuel efficiency is only about average for the category. The 3.0 V6 in the Outlander GT has a Neutral Idle Control feature, which automatically shifts into neutral at stops to conserve a little fuel.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Mitsubishi Outlander is in its final year of production before a major redesign so changes for 2013 are limited to feature offerings. Heated outside mirrors and front seats, Sirius/XM satellite radio, automatic climate control, the FUSE voice-operated command system and a rear-seat DVD player become available, depending on trim.
As one of the larger vehicles in its segment, the 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander strikes a satisfying balance between compact and mid-size SUVs. The Outlander differentiates itself from the competition with an array of optional tech features along with aggressive styling, generous cargo space and available (if snug) seating for seven. Its mechanicals allow the Outlander to fulfill the promise of its bold exterior design: a sport-tuned suspension system, lightweight aluminum roof and available all-wheel drive (AWD) with three driver-selectable modes help deliver a sporting, dynamic driving experience unusual among small SUVs.

On the low end, the Impreza’s price is in the realm of other compact sedans and hatches, including the Mazda3, Toyota Matrix, Chevy Cruze and Ford Focus.

Driving the Used 2013 Subaru ImprezaSubaru’s calling card has long been the sophisticated all-wheel-drive system that is standard in almost all its cars. The system puts power to wheels according to need and greatly helps the car maintain control on varying road surfaces. Drivers who live in locales where it snows love these cars for their surefootedness. The new engine and continuously-variable transmission (CVT) introduced for 2012 models carry over for 2013 Imprezas. The CVT improves fuel economy commendably, but makes acceleration feel a bit leisurely. WRX and STI models retain their turbocharged engines and are available only with manual transmissions. The WRX is fast; the STI is even faster and has additional settings to adjust the center differential for optimum power distribution to the wheels. The STI’s extra dose of power and handling come at the expense of ride comfort, and you might want to get a good chiropractor if you plan to travel long distances in it. The WRX better blends performance and ride comfort, though its shifter feels a bit rubbery. 
Interior ComfortSimple and easy-to-use would be the best way of describing the Impreza’s interior. Plain may be another. Everything here is functional, and most operations are easy to accomplish, except for the buttons for heating the front seats on models so equipped – they are awkwardly located below the driver’s-side armrest. Impreza models can be made more cozy with leather-trimmed upholstery. Passenger room is good for four adults and cargo space is especially generous in 5-door hatchback models, which can swallow more than 52 cubic feet of stuff with the rear seats folded.
Exterior StylingThe new sheetmetal that arrived with last year’s revamp could be called ""polite,"" with not many attributes to ruffle feathers. Among the most prominent features are the ""hawk eye"" headlights and prominent wheel arches. The 5-door hatchback versions are graced with a gently sloping roof and available cargo racks. WRX and STI models retain the previous generation’s body styles and further stand out with aggressive features, including a hood-mounted air intake, deep side sills, trunk-mounted wings on sedans and four exhaust pipes.
Favorite FeaturesFUEL ECONOMYHigh fuel economy and all-wheel drive rarely go hand in hand, but the Subaru Impreza offers both. Models with CVT automatic transmissions are rated at up to 36 mpg on the highway.
TURBOCHARGED ENGINEThe high-performance 4-cylinder engines in the Impreza WRX and STI models create much more power than the engine in other Impreza models. The result is blistering acceleration and passing power.
Standard FeaturesThree major trim levels are available on the 2013 Subaru Impreza: 2.0i, 2.0i Premium, and 2.0i Limited. Base models are equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, power windows and doors, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, keyless entry and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary and USB inputs and Bluetooth audio streaming. Higher-trim models include the automatic transmission, leather seating, larger wheels, heated front seats, automatic climate control and a 6-speaker audio system with HD Radio for receiving digital broadcasts. Two well-equipped wagon-only versions, the 2.0i Sport Premium and Sport Limited, have 17-inch wheels and fog lights. WRX and STI models have more powerful engines and stiffer suspensions, and the WRX STI has Brembo high-performance brakes.
Factory OptionsOptions for the Impreza include a CVT automatic transmission on models not already so equipped, power moonroof, voice-activated navigation system with 6.1-inch touch screen, cold-weather package with de-icer and heated seats. Other cold-environment accessories include a battery warmer and engine-block heater. WRX and STI performance models can be upgraded with satellite radio, short-throw shifter and turbo-boost gauge.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2013 Subaru Impreza models except the WRX and STI use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine connected to a 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. The CVT in all but base models has paddle shifters for manual shifting. At 148 horsepower, the engine is adequate to get the car up to speed, but not in a great hurry. WRX and STI models use a larger, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that has been turbocharged to make 265 or 305 horsepower, respectively; these are fast cars. The WRX has a 5-speed manual transmission and the STI a 6-speed manual. The Subaru engines are of a type known as ""boxer,"" in which the cylinders are arranged horizontally and opposed to each other, with the pistons moving somewhat as a boxer punching. These engines have a low center of gravity, which enhances handling, and are also known for ruggedness, durability and performance. Impreza models with the 2.0-liter engine can run on regular unleaded, while WRX and STI models require premium unleaded of 91-octane or higher.

And if you’re looking to make a visual statement, the sharp-looking Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima will draw more attention.
What's New?After its thorough remake last year, aimed specifically at attracting more American consumers, Volkswagen’s mid-size Passat sedan is little changed for 2013. Some tweaking inside makes the center console’s cup holders and storage space more functional, and a rearview camera is now offered on the top SEL trim level.
Last year, Volkswagen completely reinvented the Passat mid-size sedan, and aimed it straight at the heart of American shoppers. Bigger, conservatively styled, with lots of standard equipment and a lower price, the Passat retained its German driving feel even though VW now builds it in Chattanooga, Tennessee. For 2013, the Passat continues to deliver great value for money. It plays in the tough heart of the market, where the iconic Toyota Camry and Honda Accord set the beat and more edgy upstarts like the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima play counterpoint. But the new VW Passat is carving out its niche as a comfortable, affordable 4-door with good space, lots of features, great road manners, and an honored spot on KBB’s list of the 10 Best Family Cars of 2013.
Used 2013 Volkswagen Passat PricingA base 2013 Volkswagen Passat S, with the 2.5-liter engine and manual transmission, starts at a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $21,640. If you prefer an automatic, that means the Appearance Package (includes alloy wheels) for another $2,100. A full-boat SEL Premium package tops $31,000. The TDI turbodiesel Passat spans a range of $27,000 (SE) to $33,700 (SEL Premium). The 3.6-liter V6 engine (DSG automatic only) starts around $30,000 for an SE and climbs past $34,000 for an SEL Premium. The Passat competes in the crowded mid-size segment, which includes heavyweights like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, as well as value-oriented rides like the Kia Optima and Hyundai Sonata. Check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what local transaction prices are running. In resale value, the Passat falls behind the Camry and Accord but bests the Optima and Sonata over time.
Driving the Used 2013 Volkswagen PassatThe Volkswagen Passat sedan has grown substantially to appeal to North American sensibilities, but even though it’s now a larger, heavier car, you’ll still be rewarded with a refined road-going experience. Its suspension – including a 4-link independent rear setup – cancels out most road imperfections, and body roll is nicely controlled on tight, curvy roads. The base 2.5-liter 5-cylinder is the volume leader of the Passat’s engines and is a perfectly fine around-town commuter, but if you want more zip in your drive, the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder diesel engine is where you’ll get your smiles. Its minimal turbo lag and lusty low-end torque make a trip of any length a more pleasurable experience. The final feather in the VW Passat’s cap: Whether you choose the inline-5, the TDI or the V6, this German sedan is one quiet ride. That’s a good thing, because with segment-leading rear legroom, passengers sitting there won’t need to yell to be heard.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 VW Passat isn’t flashy inside. Think clean lines and tasteful – but not overdone – chrome highlights. Lower-end Passats can look vanilla, but moving up to the Premium level adds an Autumn Nut Burl wood-trim detail that brings some visual interest to the cabin. Base S models come with standard cloth seating surfaces while SE models get V-Tex Leatherette and SEL models receive the full leather treatment with suede-like ""Dinamica"" inserts. And on the subject of seats, thanks to the Passat’s longer wheelbase, rear-seat passengers now enjoy more legroom than in any other current mid-size sedan.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 Volkswagen Passat may not be as distinctive-looking as the Passats that came before it, but its clean styling should serve it well over time. It is sleek and subtly angular in appearance, sporting a 3-bar horizontal grille and pronounced side crease lines that draw attention to the sedan’s increased length. This length also allows for a more sizable trunk – with 15.9 cubic feet of space, it’s a nearly a cubic foot larger than the trunk in the Honda Accord, which the EPA classifies as a large car.
Favorite FeaturesFENDER SOUND SYSTEMFender, the electric-guitar icon, is making its first foray into automotive audio. The Passat’s optional 9-speaker, 400-watt system developed with Panasonic provides clear, well balanced sound.
TDIOffering up to 43 miles per gallon on the highway, this clean-burning diesel engine can return nearly 800 miles per tankful. Whether you can survive for that long without a rest-stop break is another matter.
Standard FeaturesFor just over $21,000, a 2013 Volkswagen Passat S sedan (inline 5-cylinder) comes equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, hill-hold control, cloth seating, automatic dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls and a 3-year/36,000-mile maintenance program. Hoping for a USB port to plug your mobile device into? You’ll have to move up to the top SEL trim to get it.
Factory OptionsWith a lot of available options, packages and trim levels, it’s easy to equip a 2013 VW Passat the way you want. Noteworthy items include Vegan-friendly V-Tex Leatherette seating, a Fender Premium audio system, an iPod interface and the quick-shifting 6-speed dual-clutch DSG automatic transmission. For a little more oomph in your daily drive, a 3.6-liter V6 or the strong but frugal 2.0-liter 4-cylinder clean turbodiesel engine are also on the menu.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 VW Passat sedan offers three engine choices, which greatly affect the character of the car: a 2.5-liter inline-5 shared with the smaller Jetta, a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 diesel (TDI), and a 3.6-liter V6. There are four transmissions available: a 5-speed manual (with the 2.5), a 6-speed manual (TDI), a 6-speed automatic (2.5) and the DSG 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (TDI and 3.6). If how much you spend at the pump is important to you, you’ll be interested to know that the TDI can return a class-leading 43 mpg on the highway when matched with the manual transmission. In order to get comparable fuel economy in any other sedan, you’d have to move down out of the mid-size segment.

And if you want a coupe version, like what Honda offers in its Accord, you’re out of luck there as well. Those seeking the lowest price in the segment, meanwhile, may be attracted to a Hyundai Sonata or Subaru Legacy.",22495,"Driving the Used 2013 Ford FusionThe 2013 Ford Fusion stands out in the mid-size sedan segment with its athletic driving character. While the base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is adequate, the sedan really shines with the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder or the even more potent 2.0-liter turbo that boasts 240 horsepower. A smooth shifting 6-speed automatic transmission is standard except in the hybrids, which use a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the 1.6 turbo which offers a sterling 6-speed manual as a no-cost option. An optional fuel-saving start/stop system on the 1.6-liter model takes getting used to and can decrease the efficiency of the climate-control system at idle. All-wheel drive, available with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine, offers extra grip. The Fusion Hybrid, meanwhile, is among the best we’ve driven. The system’s transition between the gasoline engine and electric motor is nearly seamless, and the car can travel up to 62 mph on electric power alone. The Energi plug-in hybrid’s electric-only top speed is 85 mph, and the car is rated to travel up to 21 miles on electricity alone and up to 620 miles total.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Fusion’s cabin is comfortable but feels slightly narrow, despite interior space growing compared with the last model. Four adults can sit comfortably in the Fusion, or three kids can squeeze in the back seat. At 16 cubic feet, the new Fusion’s trunk is a tad smaller than its predecessor. In hybrid models, some space is eaten up by under-floor batteries. Still, even hybrid models allow the rear seats to fold for added cargo room. The cloth seats and foam inserts in Fusion Hybrid models are made from recyclable or renewable materials. Supple leather seating and an audio/climate-control system with touch controls can be had in higher trims.
Exterior StylingFord has taken the Fusion’s outer styling to a new level for this 2nd-generation, 2013 model. The car looks like a design from Aston Martin – which Ford previously owned – rather than your average 5-passenger family sedan. Bland this is not. 2013 Fusions are distinguished by a large trapezoidal grille up front. The EasyFuel capless gas filler system means you’ll never again have to wrestle to open a fuel cap or wait for it to ""click"" into place. Energi versions have what looks like an additional fuel door on the front driver’s side that covers the port for the charging cable. An innovative light ring indicates the level of charge, with a full circle equating a full charge.
Favorite FeaturesHYBRID VERSIONPerhaps the best thing about the hybrid version of the Fusion is that you may not know it is one until you realize how little fuel you’re using. The Fusion Hybrid yields an EPA-estimated 47 mpg combined, and is a smooth operator while earning that lofty figure.
1.6-LITER TURBOCHARGED ENGINEAs with its use in the 2013 Ford Escape, this small-yet-mighty powerplant feels like the Goldilocks of the Fusion’s gasoline engine choices. Connected to either the easy-to-use 6-speed manual transmission or the 6-speed automatic with auto start/stop, this engine returns up to 37 mpg.
Standard FeaturesThe new Fusion debuts in four trims: S, SE, SE Hybrid, and Titanium. The Fusion Energi is set to arrive in early 2013. Base S models include manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary input, 16-inch wheels, and Ford’s SYNC wireless communication system with voice control. SE models add 10-way power driver’s seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system, and 17-inch wheels. Moving up to the Titanium model nets the powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, 12-speaker Sony premium audio system with HD and satellite radio, dual-zone auto climate control, a rearview camera, leather seating, and 18-inch wheels.
Factory OptionsIn addition to more powerful turbocharged engines, features available on the 2013 Ford Fusion emphasize technology for making the car safer and commutes more comfortable. Among the offerings are a reverse-sensing system, Active Park Assist to help with parallel parking, adaptive cruise control, a navigation system, and a blind-spot monitoring system. One particularly interesting and potentially life-saving feature is the Lane Keeping System. Using a windshield-mounted camera, the car keeps a digital eye on road markings to detect if the car drifts into another lane. If that happens, the system alerts the driver by sounding a warning, vibrating the steering wheel and, ultimately, applying steering torque to get the car back into the lane.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2013 Ford Fusion is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder carried over from the previous generation that makes 175 horsepower. Better engine options are the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder EcoBoost or the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which make 178 horsepower and 240 horsepower, respectively. Both turbo engines can run on regular unleaded gasoline. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive limited to the 2.0-liter engine. The new Fusion is offered in two hybrid versions. The regular hybrid uses a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor to achieve 47 mpg and a total output of 188 horsepower. A plug-in version called the Energi uses the same engine and motor setup but offers a larger lithium-ion battery pack that can be recharged via an AC outlet. The Energi is estimated to travel up to 21 miles in EV mode, and up to 620 miles total before having to recharge the battery or fill up the gasoline tank. Recharge time for the battery is projected at 7 hours on a standard 120-volt outlet, or 2.5 hours on a 240-volt outlet.

Two different turbocharged 4-cylinder engines replace the V6 choices in previous models, and a plug-in hybrid called the Fusion Energi joins the regular Hybrid model, which is now rated at 47 mpg.
The 2013 Fusion marks the second generation of Ford’s mid-size family sedan. What was a good-looking car to begin with has become a dazzling one now with fresh sheet metal and slightly larger dimensions. At first glance, you might think it’s an Aston Martin. The Ford Fusion’s positive traits are more than skin-deep. Under its sleek hood, Ford has replaced the past V6 engine options with a choice of two small-but-powerful and fuel-efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder powerplants. Those seeking the greatest fuel-economy will be drawn to the Ford Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Energi, a plug-in hybrid. With great looks, solid driving dynamics and a wide variety of features at competitive prices, the 2013 Fusion can more than hold its own against rivals like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.

Driving the Used 2013 Nissan Titan Crew CabThe 2013 Nissan Titan’s engine isn’t the most powerful V8 in its class, but still offers more than enough oomph to get the job done, whether that’s passing slower traffic or hauling cargo uphill. The powertrain is responsive at all speeds, and we appreciate Nissan’s gated 5-speed automatic transmission that comes on models with front captain’s chairs. That transmission setup is particularly handy on steep descents and when towing because it allows you to shift to lower gears to spare the brakes. In our tests, we sensed some vibration coming through the steering wheel, but overall the Titan exhibits a smooth, controlled ride with better-than-average steering and handling.
Interior ComfortWith a wide array of trims and options, the 2013 Nissan Titan’s cabin can range from that of a simple work truck to something with a near-premium feel. Base models use a cloth-covered bench seat up front and offer seating for up to six people. Higher trims have a pair of leather-covered captain’s chairs up front, reducing seating capacity to five, but offering greater comfort. The Titan’s rear bench seat folds up to create more cargo space. Also offered is a front passenger seat that folds flat to create a mobile workstation. The Titan’s steering wheel tilts but does not telescope, which can compromise your driving position. Power-adjustable pedals are available, though.
Exterior StylingThe Nissan Titan can be had as a King Cab or Crew Cab – unlike competitors, there is no regular cab version. The larger Crew Cab models are available in long- or short-wheelbase configurations to accommodate a long or standard truck bed. If there is one category of vehicle in which exterior style takes a back seat to utility, it’s the pickup. It makes sense, then, that Nissan focused on adding practical features to the Titan to better help it do the work for which trucks are known: hauling stuff. To that end, available features include a 120-volt AC outlet, recessed lights and the Utili-track cargo system in the truck bed, and a lockable compartment behind the left rear wheel.
Favorite FeaturesWIDE-SWINGING REAR DOORThe rear door of Titan’s King Cab model swings out 168 degrees, making it much easier for passengers to enter and exit. And when the rear bench seat isn’t holding passengers, it folds up to create additional interior cargo space.
UTILI-TRACK CARGO MANAGEMENTThis available feature endows the Titan’s truck bed with two rails and four cleats to help lock cargo in place, a great system to have when you need to tie down and haul uneven loads.
Standard FeaturesA base 2-wheel drive (2WD) 2013 Nissan Titan S King Cab comes with air conditioning, cloth seating, a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system, a fold-up rear bench seat, washable vinyl floors, and a lockable tailgate. Even with an asking price of nearly $30,000, you might be surprised to find a column shifter (due to the 40/20/40 split bench seat) and manual-adjust mirrors in your base Titan. Also lacking in those models are features such as cruise control, Bluetooth wireless connectivity and even power windows. To get those goods on a 2013 Titan, you’ll need to spend more money on options or step up to another trim.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2013 Nissan Titan vary by trim, with most major features bundled into packages. All Titans can be had with 4-wheel drive (4WD). Other options include comfy captain’s chairs in place of the bench seat, a navigation system, Nissan’s Utili-track tie-down system, spray-on bedliner, a Rockford Fosgate premium sound system, a moonroof, a power driver’s seat, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, and connectivity features such as Bluetooth and a USB input. Titan models can also be had as flex-fuel vehicles to run on a higher blend of ethanol (E85).
Engine & TransmissionNissan Titan trucks are powered by a 5.6-liter V8 that makes 317 horsepower and is connected to a 5-speed automatic transmission with tow/haul mode. The Titan has a maximum tow rating of 9,300 pounds. The engine can also be had with the ability to run on a blend up of up to 85 percent ethanol (E85). Running on regular gasoline, the Titan’s highway rating is just 18 mpg. Four-wheel-drive models, meanwhile, have a 12 mpg rating in city driving.

While it doesn’t offer the range of engine choices or three-quarter-ton and 1-ton models like some of its peers, the Titan does come with a stout but thirsty V8 engine, king-cab or crew-cab configuration, and a choice of three bed lengths.

Driving the Used 2013 Honda CivicA number of modifications to the chassis, suspension and steering have transformed the 2013 Honda Civic into a surprisingly adept performer. The lion’s share of the credit for this above-average drivability goes to the next-generation ACE II body structure that’s both more rigid and lighter than its predecessor. Offering the type of steering and pedal response that other automakers could only dream of delivering is a testament to the engineering integrity of the Honda Civic. It’s easy to overlook excellence in these areas, but just as driving feel is a big part of the magic in a Porsche, the way the Civic gracefully listens and responds to a driver’s input is a key reason we consider the 2013 Honda Civic the connoisseur’s compact sedan.
Interior ComfortWhile its unusual dash layout might not convey the more upscale ambiance of new and newly relevant nameplates like the Hyundai Elantra, Ford Focus and Chevy Cruze, the 2013 Honda Civic continues to be one of the best compact cars in terms of interior space, storage and outward visibility. Its ergonomics are nearly flawless and most of the controls are a cinch to operate. New soft-touch materials on the instrument panel and upper door trim replace the bland look and hard plastics that gave the previous cabin a low-budget feel.
Exterior StylingSince last year’s underwhelming redesign failed to resonate with style-minded buyers, Honda’s design team went back to the drawing board to create all-new front and rear styling for the 2013 Civic sedan. The new look is defined by a wide lower grille opening, a taller trunklid and a rear horizontal chrome trim piece similar to that of the 2013 Honda Accord. While these modest cosmetic alterations might escape the eye of the casual observer, it’s hard to argue against sticking to a styling strategy that’s helped keep the Civic at or near the top of the sales charts for many years running.
Favorite FeaturesBLUETOOTH MUSIC STREAMINGWe like being able to listen to the music on our smartphone without having to plug it in, and the Civic’s standard Bluetooth Audio system is notable for how quickly it connects and begins playing.
I-MID DISPLAYStandard in all trim levels is a 5-inch LCD monitor that displays music and mileage info, plus navigation info on vehicles so equipped.
Standard FeaturesWith the stripped-down DX model grade out of the picture, every 2013 Honda Civic includes a 5-inch full-color multi-information display, rear backup camera with guidelines, Bluetooth, a sliding center armrest, integrated Pandora Internet radio, and a USB port for portable music players. Opting for the mid-tier EX trim nets a power moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels and automatic climate control, while the range-topping EX-L includes such niceties as leather upholstery, heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The Civic’s wide array of active and passive safety features are included as standard issue across the line. Civic Hybrid variants up the ante with a new Forward Collision Warning system that alerts drivers of a potential impact.
Factory OptionsOptional features for the 2013 Honda Civic are acquired by stepping up to higher trim levels. Among the most prominent features are a touch-screen navigation system with FM traffic information, auto-on/off headlights, a multi-angle backup camera, and a 6-speaker premium audio system.
Engine & TransmissionWith no direct injection or turbocharging, 140 horsepower, and five speeds not six in the manual and automatic transmissions, the 2013 Honda Civic has the simplest powertrain of the newest compact sedans. Nevertheless, it delivers exceptional fuel economy and plenty of power. The mileage-maxing HF trim features the same powertrain, but adds two highway miles per gallon with a lower ride height, aerodynamic body pieces and low-rolling-resistance tires. The Civic Si, in sedan and coupe form, delivers 201 horsepower through a 6-speed manual transmission.

Substantial improvements in styling and hardware
More standard equipment

Until now, it was virtually unheard of for an auto manufacturer to make significant revisions to a vehicle just a year after it debuted. For Honda, the lackluster interior materials, flaccid handling characteristics and high levels of cabin noise found in its all-new 2012 Civic elicited adverse reactions from the media. And while the criticism had but a marginal effect on sales numbers (not mention comparison test results), Honda has endowed the 2013 Civic with all of the refinement and performance expected of a segment leader. Thanks to an expanded list of standard features and sharper driving dynamics, the 2013 Honda Civic is primed to retain the top spot over category heavyweights like the Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra, Chevrolet Cruze and Toyota Corolla.

Cutting-edge audio, navigation and communication options are a welcome bonus.","ConsBeyond its unconventional styling, the 2013 Nissan Juke may not hold much appeal to those who require a big back seat and copious cargo space. If you want something stylish, fuel-efficient and roomy, the Kia Sportage makes an excellent alternative, as does the Mini Cooper Countryman.",21000,"Driving the Used 2013 Nissan JUKEThe 2013 Nissan Juke SUV’s taut suspension is adept in minimizing body roll and lean, with only a minimal trade-off in the areas of ride comfort. The electric-assist power steering feels pretty spot-on, although we’d still prefer a hydraulic setup in a car like this. The Juke’s big standard wheels and tires combined with its wide front and rear track also aid in stability, but those same tires do create a fair bit of road noise. When equipped with Nissan’s ""intelligent"" all-wheel-drive (AWD) package, the Juke gains a torque-vectoring setup and a CVT transmission usually found only in much more expensive vehicles. AWD Jukes also ditch the base car’s torsion-beam rear axle in favor of more desirable independent rear suspension. The Nissan Juke’s raised driving position, oversized side mirrors and good driver sightlines make it easy to maneuver in all but the tightest confines.
Interior ComfortIf you’re into cutting-edge interior styling, the 2013 Nissan Juke SUV is the poster child for the compact SUV segment. From its molded plastic center console that mimics a motorcycle’s fuel tank to the multifunction ventilation controls that, with a push of a button, change to become the Sport/Normal/Eco mode throttle controls, the Juke’s interior is a visual smorgasbord. Don’t look for much in the way of cargo space because with only 10.5 cubic feet, there isn’t much. However, folding the rear seats flat creates 35 cubic feet of space, more than enough to fit all of your toys.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 Nissan Juke is a vehicle you either instantly fall in love with or run screaming from as fast as you can. From its big-eyed bumper-mounted headlights to the elongate clear plastic turn-signal/parking lights that run the length of the fender tops, the Juke appears otherworldly. Move to the side, and a roofline that squats low as it moves rearward is accented by color-keyed integrated rear door handles giving the 5-door Juke a coupe-like appearance. A single-piece hatch with electronic release opens to reveal the Juke’s rather tiny cargo hold.
Favorite FeaturesI-CON (ADVANCED-INTEGRATED CONTROL) SYSTEM INTERFACEStandard on the Juke SV and SL, Nissan’s slick I-CON interface/display toggles between ""Climate"" and ""D-mode,"" each with its own specific graphics. In the former, I-CON commands all heat/air functions while the latter features Normal/Sport/Eco settings that appropriately revise the electronic mapping for throttle response, transmission shifts and steering feel.
INTELLIGENT AWD WITH TORQUE VECTORINGAvailable on all three Juke trim levels, Nissan’s Intelligent All-Wheel Drive system can create up to a 50/50 front/rear power split and also distribute torque from side to side on the rear axle to improve handling and reduce understeer when cornering.
Standard FeaturesBeyond first-rate powertrain/suspension/vehicle dynamics elements shared with its SV/SL kin, even the base Juke nets Nissan’s Xtronic CVT automatic transmission plus power windows/locks/mirrors, air conditioning, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio, iPod connectivity, Bluetooth, cruise control, keyless remote entry, a multifunction steering wheel, trip computer, vehicle security/immobilizer systems and front/front-side/side-curtain airbags. The SV adds premium upholstery cloth, a power moonroof, automatic climate control, the I-CON multifunction controller, satellite radio, a USB port and privacy glass, while SL trim includes the Navigation Package, leather upholstery, heated front seats, fog lights, and auto on/off headlights.
Factory OptionsNissan’s decision to develop three definitive variations on the Juke theme keeps the formal extras list on each to a minimum. The sole choice for 2013 Juke S buyers consists of front- (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD). At the SV level, that list expands to include swapping its standard 6-speed manual transmission for the CVT and adding the Navigation Package that brings an SD-card-based navi system with 5.0-inch color LCD screen, rearview monitor, the Rockford Fosgate Ecopunch system and USB connectivity. The fully loaded SL limits its configuration alternatives to front/AWD and/or 6MT/CVT transmissions.
Engine & TransmissionAll 2013 Nissan Jukes are fitted with a 1.6-liter ""DIG"" (Direct Injection Gasoline) inline 4-cylinder that boasts the trifecta of modern engine tech – direct fuel injection, turbocharging/intercooling and variable camshaft timing – here on both the intake and exhaust side – to deliver an impressive mix of performance and economy. Generating a stout 188 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque from 2,000-5,200 revs, it matches well with the CVT automatic (which includes S-mode that serves up six ""virtual"" gears) and the 6-speed manual gearbox, and can comfortably handle the added weight of the AWD system. A manual-equipped FWD Juke can sprint to 60 mph in around seven seconds, while the CVT and AWD each add about a half tick to that baseline figure.

In the 2013 Juke compact SUV, Nissan has created something really quite extraordinary. It’s a small SUV – smaller than a CR-V or RAV4 – that is part people-carrier, part off-road dune buggy and part sports car. The Juke can accommodate four people, or its rear seats can be folded to form a fairly large and level cargo floor. Powered by a small 4-cylinder turbocharged engine and offering a choice of a manual gearbox (front-wheel drive only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), the Juke struts its sporty credentials. This sporting nature is bolstered by the variable throttle settings and an enthusiast-oriented sport suspension, two features that further distance it from more pedestrian compact SUVs.

Front-wheel drive (FWD) and synthetic steering feel combine in a car that’s neither as engaging around town nor as capable at the limits compared to some of its more storied rear-wheel-drive competitors. On the flip side, the Acura TL is about 100 times more fun than the soft-tuned Lexus ES 350 with which it also sort of competes. Stepping up to the SH-AWD version nets more horsepower, a sportier suspension and Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system that directs more energy to the outside rear wheel while cornering. You have to push the TL pretty hard before you can feel SH-AWD working, but that’s exactly when you need it. Otherwise, around town and on the highway the TL behaves like most other performance-oriented mid-size sedans.
Interior ComfortWe find the 2013 Acura TL’s interior luxuriously sporty. Platinum-plated trim pieces on the dash, center console and doorsills are a nice touch, but what we like most are the excellent sport front seats. In addition to being heated, the front seats are now ventilated (Advance Package only), and the overall interior noise level has been reduced by 2.7 decibels thanks to an increased amount of body sealing points.
Exterior StylingThe Acura TL’s unique appearance includes a beak-like grille surround with a large chrome plate on the upper portion. Other features of note include darkened headlights, narrow side turn signals and recessed fog lights. Out back the TL’s bumper includes a relocated license-plate frame that sits higher, making way for a rear diffuser.
Favorite Features6-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION?The Acura TL’s 6-speed transmission is a major contributor to the car’s good fuel economy. More gears also equal more fun as the transmission is able to keep the engine in its sweet spot during spirited driving. As a bonus, the revised gearing results in lower engine rpm while cruising, resulting in lower cabin noise.
BLIND SPOT INFORMATION SYSTEM?We like everything that comes with the Advance Package, but if we had to choose one thing, it would be the blind-spot information system. These indicators tell the driver if there is a car in the blind spot, which is a handy reassurance when changing lanes.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 TL comes well equipped right out of the box, which can’t be said for many of its competitors. Some of the most notable features include heated leather seats, a power moonroof, 276-watt audio system with Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a 10-way power driver’s seat and 17-inch alloy wheels. In addition to all-wheel drive and more horsepower, the TL SH-AWD trim adds to the list by offering additional seat bolstering for a sportier feel and French stitching on the steering wheel, seats, shift lever and parking brake.
Factory OptionsThe 2013 Acura TL is available with two option packages: the Technology Package and the Advance Package. The Technology Package includes a hard-drive-based navigation system with AcuraLink traffic and weather updates, 440-watt surround-sound system, Milano premium leather seating surfaces and the keyless access system. The Advance Package comes with a Blind Spot Information (BSI) system, ventilated (cooling) front seats and plus-one wheel sizes (equals 18-inch wheels for the base, 19-inch wheels for the SH-AWD trim).
Engine & TransmissionEngine choices available for the 2013 Acura TL include a 280-horsepower 3.5-liter or a 305-horsepower 3.7-liter V6. A Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic is available on both trims, but the 6-speed manual transmission is exclusive to the SH-AWD trim level. The 6-speed automatic features a ""double-kick-down"" feature that lets the driver downshift twice (from 5th to 3rd gear, for example) to aid performance in spirited driving situations. The 6-speed automatic also improves the city/highway fuel economy of the 3.5-liter versions by 2-3 miles per gallon, respectively. When matched with the 3.7-liter engine the new transmission ups fuel economy by 1 mpg city and highway.

Despite a subtle reshaping last year, the 2013 Acura TL retains its rather distinct, some might even say polarizing, exterior. For Acura purists, however, it’s what’s underneath the skin that counts. Acura is masterful at packing a lot of content into its cars, helping a fully loaded model stay thousands less than a comparable BMW or Audi. Less money doesn’t mean less performance, with the 2013 TL offering Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) mated to a 300-plus-horsepower V6 engine. Acura hopes the freshened TL will lure even more buyers from varied temptresses like the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti M. But, with no rear drive model in the lineup, driving purists probably won’t be rushing to make the switch.

You can find the same electrifying performance specs from the newly-released Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 and a more luxurious ride from Audi’s Q7.",950,"Although no longer the only sport-oriented SUV on the market, the 2013 BMW X5 remains true to its original formula. Where others have grown larger, the X5 retains its modest size and seating arrangement. And, while many SUVs have moved to deliver a softer ride with compromised handling, the BMW X5 for 2013 retains, for better or worse, the same firm steering, aggressive handling and notoriously stiff ride. The X5’s various trims cover a wide range, from the entry-level 6-cylinder X5 xDrive35i to the performance oriented xDrive50i with the M Performance Package to the tire-smoking X5 M. Due to a late introduction last year, the diesel-powered xDrive35d will continue as a 2012 until late in the 2013 model year.
Used 2013 BMW X5 PricingThe 2013 BMW X5 xDrive35i has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just over $48,000. The X5 Premium begins at roughly $56,000, while the X5 Sport Activity is over $58,500. Adding V8 power elevates the window sticker some $7,000 (to over $65,000), and the X5 M is above $89,000 and easily surpasses six figures with all options. A random showroom sampling revealed an xDrive35i Premium with $4,200 of optional equipment; with destination, the MSRP was around $60,000. The competitors include entries ranging from Acura’s MDX to Audi’s Q7. At the performance end, the Infiniti FX and Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 also give the BMW X5 a run for its money. In most instances, the X5 SUV reflects both good value and excellent resale. Be sure to check Kelley Blue Book’s Fair Purchase Price to see what consumers are actually paying in your market area.
Driving the Used 2013 BMW X5With a sophisticated suspension, excellent braking, communicative steering and at least 300 horsepower, the 2013 BMW X5 – in any of its iterations – provides a compelling testament to BMW’s engineering prowess. No amount of engineering, however, can completely disguise the X5’s mass, some 5,000 pounds in basic xDrive35i form. This remains a Sport Activity Vehicle and not, notably, a sport sedan; care should be given to operate an SUV in a more conservative manner than a sport sedan or Sports/GT. If you demand a combination of ""sport"" and ""utility,"" few will deliver that combo more credibly than BMW’s X5.
Interior ComfortIn ""growing"" the brand, BMW expanded X5 cargo capacity via a longer and higher body in combination with a lower cargo floor. Rear seats fold flat, and an optional third row is available. That third row is best reserved for children; BMW’s target demographic for the 2013 X5 SUV is young families. The cockpit is oriented to the driver, while a generous greenhouse provides excellent outward visibility. Regrettably (given its starting price), leatherette is the standard seating material for both the xDrive35i and xDrive35d. The handy 2-piece tailgate provides easy access to the rear compartment.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 BMW X5 somehow manages to hide its bulk with a series of clever angles and rounded edges. These cues, in combination with a longish wheelbase and short overhangs, give the new X5 a visual athleticism not evident on the previous generation. Eighteen-inch wheels (standard) contribute to a planted stance, while both 19-inch and 20-inch wheels are available for those wanting an even more aggressive look – and more aggressive on-road capability.
Favorite FeaturesxDrive35d DIESELOffering 265 horsepower and a stump-pulling 425 lb-ft of torque, BMW’s Advanced Diesel is the perfect engine for the times. It delivers acceleration from zero to 60 mph in under seven seconds and has an EPA highway fuel-economy number of 26 mpg.
xDrive FULL-TIME ALL-WHEEL DRIVEWith limited ground clearance and all-season tires, the 2013 X5 has few off-road aspirations, but it does have one of the best all-weather, all-wheel-drive systems available, which electronically varies front-to-rear torque and traction control to optimize grip.
Standard FeaturesAll X5 models enjoy a generous level of standard equipment. The 2013 X5 xDrive35i includes xDrive all-wheel drive (no 2WD variants offered), Hill Descent Control, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, 3-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel, 10-way power-adjustable driver’s and passenger’s seats, iDrive system with on-board computer and controller and AM/FM stereo with 205 watts transmitted through 10 speakers. This, of course, is above and beyond the dynamic capabilities standard on every BMW. The X5 xDrive35d brings to the table 4-cylinder efficiency, prodigious torque and a third-row seat. Finally, both the X5 xDrive50i and X5 M have stupendous performance.
Factory OptionsThe base X5 xDrive35i is notable for the number of options not available. A Convenience Package includes the panoramic moonroof, while navigation, heated front seats, a third-row seat and satellite radio can be ordered separately. Choose the X5 xDrive35i Premium model and your variables expand exponentially. A Luxury Seating Package, Cold Weather Package, Premium Sound Package and Convenience Package are just a few of the options you can include on your new X5. The M Performance Package adds 15 horsepower to the 6-cylinder trim and 40 horsepower to the V8 model.
Engine & TransmissionAs with most purchases, the decision is finalized by balancing your needs, your wants and your budget. The great thing about BMW’s engine mix is that not one of them sacrifices performance; even the slowest, BMW’s 3.0-liter turbodiesel, accelerates from a stop to 60 mph in under seven seconds. If you should want to stretch the envelope to its max, opt for the X5 M. This variant (of the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8) offers no less than 555 horsepower.

A Hyundai Elantra, Mazda3 or Ford Focus is likely a better match.",17000,"Driving the Used 2013 Toyota CorollaWhile the S trim is the most enjoyable to drive, all of the 2013 Toyota Corolla sedans deliver a solid, comfortable ride and no rude surprises. The S trim’s larger wheel-and-tire package and available manual transmission allow it to at least attempt some fun on twisting back roads, but don’t look for a lot of zip coming out of the corners, because the Corolla’s 1.8-liter engine can’t provide much. As basic transportation for those with pragmatic automotive tastes, the quiet, soft-riding Corolla does just fine. But the lazy responses make a Mazda3 or Honda Civic seem quite sporty. And the Corolla’s fuel economy, though good, is hardly class-leading.
Interior ComfortWhile the 2013 Toyota Corolla sedan’s interior is highly functional and very roomy, it falls far short of the styling and color offerings of some if its less-conservative competitors. Gray or beige plastics and dated-looking gauge faces don’t inspire the same enthusiasm as the interior of a Hyundai Elantra, Ford Focus or Mazda3. The Corolla’s rear seat offers good hip and shoulder room, but the all-important headroom and legroom figures come up a bit short. Cargo volume in the trunk is a useful 12.3 cubic feet and can be expanded thanks to the 60/40-split folding rear seats.
Exterior StylingThe Toyota family resemblance runs strong in the Corolla, which may be good or bad. Swept-back headlights and a racy grille (with new chrome highlights for 2013) don’t keep the side view from looking pretty pedestrian, but this car is not aimed at exhibitionists. The S trim level injects a little visual excitement, with 16-inch alloy wheels (17s optional), rear spoiler and lower-body add-ons.
Favorite FeaturesTILT/TELESCOPIC STEERING WHEELThis much-appreciated standard feature helps drivers of all sizes find a comfortable position.
USB iPOD INPUTStandard with the audio head unit on the LE and S, and optional on the L, this feature allows for control of your iPod via buttons on the car’s steering wheel.

The LE adds an MP3-compatible CD player, USB and auxiliary input jacks, Bluetooth, cruise control and heated side mirrors. The S has fog lights, front and rear spoilers, sport seats and a leather-trimmed steering wheel.
Factory OptionsThe 2013 Toyota Corolla offers only a few options. A power moonroof can be added to the S trim, while both the LE and S versions can be equipped with a nav-screen audio system and Toyota’s Entune multi-media system. Those two higher trim levels also offer Premium Packages that bundle such extras as the moonroof, bigger alloy wheels, fog lights, power-adjustable driver’s seat, automatic climate control and halogen headlights.
Engine & TransmissionThe lone engine fitted to the 2013 Corolla is a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder good for 132 horsepower. Transmission choices are a 5-speed manual or old-tech 4-speed automatic. Performance is only average in terms of acceleration, but noise and vibration levels are good, as is expected reliability. This engine delivers EPA fuel-economy numbers that are respectable, if not exactly standard-setting for the class: 27 mpg city and 34 mpg highway for the manual gearbox, and 26/34 for the automatic.

The 2013 Toyota Corolla sedan is the current incarnation of the best-selling automobile ever. It continues to be one of the most familiar – if not exactly most popular – compact sedans in America. The Corolla’s reputation is built on legendary longevity, low fuel consumption and high resale value. But has Toyota become complacent with it? Despite a major refresh in 2011 and new grille trim for 2013, placed next to a Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra or Chevy Cruze, the Toyota Corolla looks frumpy and plain. More features are available for comparable money, and the VW Jetta TDI and Mazda3 Skyactiv deliver more driving excitement plus 40-mpg fuel economy. The Corolla relies on the faithful shoppers who march into Toyota showrooms year after year.

Driving the Used 2013 Ford EscapeThe new Ford Escape is the sporty compact car of compact SUVs – a title it shares with the new Mazda CX-5. Ford’s recent cars have impressed with European-like driving dynamics and feel, and the new Escape continues the trend. When outfitted with the 240-horsepower engine, there’s not a competitor that could keep up. Fortunately, the characteristics that contribute to the high fun-factor also help make the Escape a pleasure to drive to the store and the office. The 1.6- and 2.0-liter EcoBoost engines are terrific, both delivering smooth, ready power around town, effortless cruising on the highway and – especially the 2.0 engine – plenty of passing power. It isn’t the softest-riding entry in the segment, but most will find it perfectly comfortable. The 2013 Ford Escape is arguably the best-driving compact SUV out there, but the styling, technology and fuel economy are what really set it apart.
Interior ComfortThe inside of the 2013 Ford Escape boasts such an impressive collection of materials, design and available features that it can feel a class above. Don’t try to pass it off as a mid-size SUV, though, because the Escape’s interior is among the category’s smaller cabins.
Exterior StylingThe compact SUV segment is definitely developing a greater sense of style, and the 2013 Ford Escape furthers the trend. Exterior highlights that distinguish upper-tier Escape models include HID headlamps, fog lights, body-color mirrors and trim, dual chrome exhaust tips and big 19-inch wheels (which will eventually need to be re-wrapped in expensive 19-inch tires).
Favorite FeaturesHANDS-FREE LIFTGATEWhen your hands are full of shopping bags, furniture or man things, you can just wave your foot under the rear bumper and the liftgate opens automatically. It’s Escape sign language for ""open sesame.""
MYKEYFor teen drivers who always wanted a Big Brother, MyKey lets parents designate a key that will limit top speed, limit audio volume or even disable the audio system altogether until the seatbelts are buckled.
Standard FeaturesAt its base price of $23,295, the 2013 Ford Escape S features a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/Aux sound system, air conditioning, steering wheel with audio and cruise controls, the parent-friendly MyKey system, and a full complement of airbags and electronic safety features. Base model compromises include covered steel wheels and black plastic exterior trim elements.
Factory OptionsA fully loaded 2013 Ford Escape Titanium can reach all the way past $37,000, but with enough cool features to embarrass many luxury cars. In addition to a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, 4-wheel drive, leather seats and a panoramic moonroof, a top-tier Escape offers blind-spot warning, automatic parallel parking, an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation, Sync with MyFord Touch, and a liftgate that opens with a wave of your foot. You could get the new Acura RDX for the same money, but you wouldn’t have as many cool features to play with.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Ford Escape is the only compact SUV with a choice of three engines. It would be easier to recommend the excellent 240-horsepower 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine if the 178-horsepower 1.6-liter version weren’t more affordable, more efficient, just as smooth, and still plenty powerful for most. The base 2.5-liter engine is probably just fine – we haven’t driven the latest iteration – but we’d buy a different compact SUV before buying the base Escape S with which that engine is paired. All three engines are paired with a responsive 6-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control, driving either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (4WD). If you want 4WD you’ll have to choose one of the EcoBoost engines. And if you want the Escape’s full towing capacity of 3,500 pounds, you’re into the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine (and the towing package eliminates the hands-free liftgate option).

Totally revamped for 2013
Hands-free power liftgate (operated by a foot wave)

All-new and totally rethought for 2013, Ford’s compact crossover SUV is now one of the segment’s style leaders, a fuel-efficiency expert and a total tech geek. Highlights include a choice of impressive engines, athletic suspension tuning and an updated version of the MyFord Touch infotainment system. But the first feature buyers will want to show their friends is a power liftgate they can open and close by waving a foot under the rear bumper. Compact SUV shoppers looking for maximum affordability or roominess will want to look elsewhere, but the 2013 Ford Escape is as a must-see for everyone else.

Though not necessarily lightning fast, these diminutive British vehicles are immensely fun to fling around corners. That dynamic nature extends to the 2013 Countryman, but due to its larger size and added weight, it isn’t quite as agile as its smaller and lighter siblings. For a crossover SUV, though, the 2013 Mini Countryman is immensely fun to drive, especially for drivers willing to shift for themselves via the snappy 6-speed manual transmission. Those drivers will also likely prefer the higher-powered Cooper S version of the Countryman that features a turbocharged engine. Mini enthusiasts willing to take the financial plunge of the new, $35,000-plus John Cooper Works edition of the Countryman will be rewarded with an invigorating little mover that has an intoxicating exhaust note that growls with the best of them. On the flip side, the Countryman’s stiffer suspension results in a firmer overall ride.
Interior ComfortThe Countryman’s cabin is just as charismatic as others in the Mini lineup. That’s to say there is the usual dichotomy of the massively oversized speedometer in the center of the car with scads of small buttons and dials below. Thankfully the power window switches have finally been removed from this area and placed in the door housings like the majority of other cars. For 2013, the Countryman now comes standard with a 3-person rear bench, with the pair of individual rear seats now a no-cost option. With that latter setup is a unique rail system that runs between the seats. Available as one or two sections, the rail enables you to attach cup holders, an iPod cradle, eyeglass case and more.
Exterior StylingPicture a Mini that’s gone muscular, and you’ll probably imagine something like the Countryman. In addition to being more than 16 inches longer than a Mini Cooper Hardtop, the Countryman is distinguished by its two rear passenger doors, extra height, and additional curves. Like the Mini’s interior, the exterior is highly customizable. There are a wealth of choices for everything from paint scheme to wheels and headlight housings. The performance-oriented John Cooper Works models are fitted with an aerodynamic kit and, like the Cooper S version, twin exhaust outlets.
Favorite FeaturesTRADITIONAL WINDOW SWITCHESDon’t get us wrong: We love the eccentricity of Mini’s retro-style switches. But having to target the awkwardly placed metal toggles in the low center dash gets to be a pain in daily driving. After a chorus of criticism, Mini has finally relented and placed the switches where you expect to find them: in the door panel. 
MINI CONNECTED INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMIn addition to the usual tech features such as navigation and Bluetooth connectivity, Mini’s system uses a driver’s smartphone and apps to play Web-based audio, access social-media sites, and even utilize Google Send to Car, which emails destinations you’ve chosen beforehand to check out. Further, the digital goodness is presented on a color 6.5-inch screen housed within Mini’s ginormous speedometer. 
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Mini Cooper Countryman comes in three major trims: Cooper, Cooper S, and John Cooper Works, with the biggest difference being their engine power output. Standard on all models are a 6-speed manual transmission, leatherette seats, AM/FM/CD/HD Radio audio with six speakers and an auxiliary input, a climate-controlled glove box, and remote entry. On the safety front, there are seven airbags, 4-channel antilock brakes, and traction and stability control. Like other new Mini models, the Countryman comes with no-cost maintenance that includes oil changes, wiper blades, brakes and rotors for three years or 36,000 miles. Roadside assistance comes standard for four years and unlimited models. 
Factory OptionsAs with other vehicles in Mini’s growing stable, the Countryman can be configured over 10 million different ways. We won’t count them here, but will instead mention some of the bigger options that can be had, often grouped in packages. The Mini Connected package is available with or without navigation and includes a nifty infotainment system and color screen that syncs with smartphones. Other goodies include a panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, a harman/kardon premium sound system, parking sensors, leather seating, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Configuring a Mini online is meant to be a fun experience as you tailor the interior and exterior to your individual taste.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Mini Countryman is powered by the same 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine as its smaller siblings. Like them, it comes in various power outputs. The base S model makes a just-adequate 121 horsepower, while the S model makes a more robust 181 horsepower. The top dog is the John Cooper Works,which delivers a potent 208 horsepower that can shuffle this vehicle from 0-60 mph in about seven seconds. Base Mini Countryman models are front-wheel drive only. The Cooper S Countryman can be had with Mini’s ALL4 all-wheel drive, which comes standard on the John Cooper Works model. Standard on all models is a snappy 6-speed manual transmission, with a 6-speed automatic optional. The Mini Countryman has good fuel economy, but it also requires premium fuel. Towing is not recommended.

Read Full Review","What's New?Among the changes to the 2013 Countryman is a little one that’s a rather big deal in Mini Land: The power-window controls are integrated into the armrests vs. the cute-but-frustrating prior setup of tiny toggles in the center dash. For 2013 the Countryman will be available in even more potent John Cooper Works form, marking the first JCW model with all-wheel drive.
Think of the 2013 Mini Cooper Countryman as the ""big Mini."" Though still small by regular-car standards, the Countryman is the roomiest, most passenger-friendly vehicle in the expanding Mini lineup. With four real doors, seating for five and a rear cargo hatch, the Mini Cooper Countryman breathes more everyday practicality into the British marque and BMW sub-brand. As a crossover SUV, the Countryman doesn’t have the cargo-hauling or towing capability of bigger vehicles such as the Ford Escape or Honda CR-V, but it does offer something those others can’t match: The nimble driving characteristics for which all Minis are known. Given these traits plus fuel efficiency and the availability of all-wheel drive, the Countryman may just be the motivator needed for those who yearn for a Mini but need more room.

If your off-road needs are light-to-moderate, a Subaru Outback or Toyota 4Runner might make a better choice.",23000,"Driving the Used 2013 Jeep WranglerWhat we like best about the Jeep Wrangler is that it still delivers the things that make off-roaders happy. Among those attributes are separate body-and-frame construction, live axles front and rear and enough ground clearance to drive over a (large) sleeping dog without doing damage to dog or the Jeep. Despite the tall center of gravity, oversized tires and rudimentary suspension, Jeep engineers have done a remarkable job of taming the beast within, endowing this newest Wrangler SUV with precise steering and a suspension that keeps the tires in secure contact with the paved surfaces beneath it. Off-road, the 2013 Wrangler is everything you want in a 4WD trail rig, given its ability to poke along at a walking speed. Add real horsepower to the crawling, and favorable gearing for the hauling, and you arguably have the most competent Jeep Wrangler in the brand’s 70-year history.
Interior ComfortOur test Wrangler, a Sahara Unlimited SUV trimmed in Black/Dark Saddle leather, was just this side of sumptuous. Lower in the food chain is the base Sport, whose cloth-covered seats can best be described as functional. And although the Wrangler Unlimited’s folding rear seat creates a spacious – and flat – load surface, the headrests don’t easily detach for folding, which necessitates moving the front seats as far forward as possible when you’re in a hurry to increase cargo space.
Exterior StylingWith each generation, the Jeep Wrangler engineering team increases the vehicle’s size. That was never more evident than in the 2007 redesign, when the 2-door Wrangler grew and the 4-door Wrangler Unlimited was first introduced. In its Unlimited form, the Wrangler SUV stretches almost 15 feet and weighs almost 4,500 pounds. Still, the 2013 Wrangler’s off-road intentions remain clear, with minimal overhangs front and rear and the highly-familiar Jeep shape. The exterior design retains a greenhouse that provides excellent visibility of both the trail and adjacent scenery. New for 2013 is the Moab Special Edition that adds gloss black wheels, Trak-loc anti-spin and electronically-locking rear differential.
Favorite Features3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6Jeep’s Pentastar V6 is the final piece in the Wrangler puzzle. With ample power, smooth operation and decidedly improved highway fuel economy, this engine suits the Wrangler like a well-worn glove. And, when equipped with the available 5-speed automatic, refinement goes up while losing very little – if any – capability or efficiency.
ELECTRONIC DISCONNECTING SWAY BARWhen the off-road trail gets seriously treacherous, the Wrangler’s front sway bar can be electronically disconnected, which allows greater wheel travel. Once back on paved roads, a push of a button reconnects the sway bar.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Jeep Wrangler SUV’s 285 horsepower is among its most notable features, but with additional power comes the need for enhanced control. Jeep engineers have added a full menu of safety and security, including electronic stability control, electronic roll mitigation, Hill-start Assist and Trailer-sway Control. Add the aggressive 4WD technology on the off-road-oriented Rubicon, and the most difficult trails become almost laughably easy.
Factory OptionsThe Wrangler’s optional 5-speed automatic transmission provides the driver with more efficiency, better use of the new V6’s torque curve and, with a lower 1st-gear ratio, better ability to crawl those rocks. And Jeep is one of the few manufacturers providing you a choice of rear-end ratios (3.21, 3.73 or 4.10). That choice allows the owner to truly tailor the Wrangler to his or her specific driving needs. Comfort and convenience options include Bluetooth, navigation, Alpine speakers, leather trimmed seats and heated front seats.
Engine & TransmissionThe 3.6-liter V6 in the 2013 Jeep Wrangler is truly a revelation. Featuring alloy construction, the 60-degree V6 is lighter and more compact than the previous 3.8-liter found in the 2011 Wrangler. And, with 285 horsepower, the perceived need for a V8 is all but eliminated. With that, we continue to wish that Jeep would make available the diesel sold in many markets outside of the U.S. The diesel’s superior torque, along with an increase in fuel economy, would be all the new EPA regulations – and Jeep consumers – might ask for.

Changes to the soft top make it easier for one person to operate, and there is a new premium cloth option that is easier to clean and triple-layered for better sound deadening.
Although it is larger and safer than past models wearing the CJ and Wrangler nameplate, the 2013 Jeep Wrangler is still true to its heritage as America’s best-loved off-road escape artist. A wide model range spans the spectrum, from the basic 2-door soft-top Sport, to the maxed-out trail-blazing Rubicon. The Wrangler Unlimited includes a stretched wheelbase and four doors, as well as an available removable hard top with configurable roof panels. Powered by Chrysler’s new Pentastar V6, the Jeep Wrangler for 2013 delivers an excellent balance of power and fuel economy; the Wrangler is also one of the last off-road vehicles still to offer a manual transmission.

The 173-horsepower engine has to work a bit, but once up to speed, the CVT finds and holds the engine’s peak torque, providing a good balance of response and efficiency. The CVT does take some getting used to, as there are no discernible gearshifts like a traditional automatic. The standard steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, however, allow the driver to simulate manual gearshifts, for quicker passing and merging. With an estimated 30 mpg highway and an 18-gallon fuel tank, the Outback can cruise well over 500 miles before refueling. On the road, the Outback demonstrates an impressive sedan-like feel, in part because the low center of gravity of its powertrain more than offsets its tall bodywork. Steering is precise and predictable, and only some slight wind noise around the roof racks intrudes on the quiet ride.
Interior ComfortThe roomy, versatile 2013 Subaru Outback cabin is stylishly functional. Responding to owners’ desires for more rear-seat room, Subaru added four inches of legroom and nearly three inches of headroom with the 2010 redesign. During our test drive, we comfortably fit three 6-foot adults in the back seat without their knees touching the front seatbacks. Wide front seats and a reclining rear seat further improve comfort, while the upscale Limited and Premium trims offer power driver’s-side lumbar support and leather seating. A dash-mounted electronic parking brake frees up console space for water bottles and latte cups. Automatic-transmission models also feature steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.
Exterior StylingWhile previous Subaru Outback generations seemed more like a jacked-up, fender-flared Legacy, the newest models – including the Outback – take on more personality of their own, with a 3-inch-higher roofline and a better-integrated look of ruggedness. Thick plastic cladding, a raised ride height and 8.7 inches of ground clearance reveal its off-road capability, while beefy black roof rails conceal fold-out crossbars that stow away to reduce drag when not in use. The Outback’s exterior styling looks even sleeker for 2013 thanks to new headlights, a redesigned front bumper and a more prominent grille.
Favorite FeaturesCONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (CVT)Subaru’s take on the popular, fuel-saving transmission-without-gears features a paddle-shifted manual mode that mimics the shift points of a manual transmission without needing a clutch pedal. Best of all, the Outback CVT’s estimated 24 city/30 highway mpg is better than with the 6-speed manual.
ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE WITH HILL-HOLDER FUNCTIONThe traditional parking brake handle is replaced by a soft-touch push/pull switch on the dash. The electronic brake system includes a feature that holds the brakes for a moment on inclines greater than five degrees, for easier takeoffs without unwanted rollback.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Subaru Outback is offered in five trim levels: 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, 2.5i Limited, 3.6R and 3.6R Limited. Base 2.5i models feature all-wheel drive, a 6-speed manual transmission, 16-inch steel wheels with covers, roof rails and a 4-speaker audio system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable music players. Moving up to the Premium trim adds alloy wheels, fog lights, a 10-way power driver’s seat, and two additional speakers, while range-topping Limited versions include leather seating, dual-zone climate control and 440-watt harman/kardon sound system. Safety equipment consists of six airbags, all of the expected electronic stability controls, and Subaru’s new EyeSight driver-assistance system, which includes an adaptive cruise control system that automatically maintains a preset distance between the vehicle ahead, pre-collision braking, and lane-departure warning to alert drivers of an unintentional lane change.
Factory OptionsMost options for the Subaru Outback are dependent on trim level. The CVT automatic transmission is the lone option on the base 2.5i, with Premium and Limited models offering a Power Moonroof Package comprised of an auto-dimming rearview mirror, rear backup camera and – you guessed it – a power moonroof. Limited models offer voice-activated navigation, the aforementioned EyeSight safety system and a Special Appearance Package with metallic gray exterior adornments, wood-grain-style interior trim and keyless access with push-button start. Given the standard audio system’s marginally adequate sound quality, we suggest upgrading to the available 9-speaker harman/kardon setup.
Engine & TransmissionSubaru offers two boxer engines in the 2013 Outback. What’s a boxer engine? Glad you asked: It’s a low-profile and naturally balanced design in which the pistons lay flat in a horizontally opposed configuration. The new 2.5-liter four delivers 173 horsepower, not best-in-class but enough muscle for satisfactory performance. Matching this engine with the CVT automatic will produce the best fuel economy, but the 6-speed manual offers sportier performance. The most refined choice for the Outback is the 3.6-liter 6-cylinder and its conventional 5-speed automatic, whose strong acceleration and passing power come at the expense of fuel efficiency: an estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway (versus the 4-cylinder CVT’s 24/30).
2.5-liter boxer-4173 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm174 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/28 mpg (manual), 24/30 mpg (automatic)

Read Full Review","What's New?The Subaru Outback receives a fairly significant mid-cycle refresh for 2013. Chief among the changes are a modified body structure and suspension, which result in less body roll and reduced interior noise. Additional refinements include new audio systems, a restyled front end, and a new 4-cylinder engine that is both more powerful and fuel efficient.
Though it was originally promoted as the “world’s first sport utility wagon,” the 2013 Subaru Outback is more SUV than wagon, and that’s a good thing. It’s as spacious and capable as a conventional mid-size SUV, but delivers the fuel efficiency and driving characteristics of a sedan. The Outback also provides the all-weather mobility afforded by Subaru’s symmetrical all-wheel-drive and an elevated seating position for a more commanding view of the road. Competing vehicles such as the Toyota Venza, Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox each excel in particular categories, but the 4th-generation Outback’s balanced blend of on- and off-road proficiency offers a unique flavor in an otherwise well-defined category.

Given its generous level of standard equipment, its lengthy warranty and rising residual values, the Sonata offers perhaps the best value of the group.","ConsWhile Hyundai’s groundbreaking Fluidic Sculpture design language resonates with many new-car buyers, some might prefer the more subtle looks of the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord or Chevrolet Malibu. When stacked up against the second-generation Camry Hybrid, the Sonata Hybrid suffers from deficiencies in driving dynamics, fuel efficiency and overall ride quality.",21500,"Driving the Used 2013 Hyundai SonataFor how quickly and smoothly the 2013 Hyundai Sonata pulls away from a stop, you’d swear there was a V6 engine under its sleek hood. Instead, what resides there is a 2.4-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and delivering fuel economy figures of 24 mpg city and 35 mpg highway. If that’s not enough power for you, the 2013 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T sedan adds a turbocharger that brings output to a very healthy 274 horsepower. The Sonata excels in virtually every category, with excellent brakes and a suspension that delivers smoothness when the road gets nasty and level cornering when the asphalt starts to curve. Steering feel, however, is somewhat vague, and interior noise levels are a bit higher than those in competitors such as the Chevy Malibu and Honda Accord. From a comfort standpoint, our Limited trim level’s seats were very comfortable, the dash and instrumentation were nice to look at and easy to figure out, and all but the tallest test drivers found the rear-seat headroom and legroom to be exceptional.
Interior ComfortLike its dynamic exterior, the 2013 Hyundai Sonata’s interior is a work of art. Following the exterior design theme, the Sonata’s interior is a mix of bold shapes, smooth finishes and lots of attractive blue backlighting. The available 2-tone interior package looks particularly inviting in black and wine leather, and features such as the Limited trim’s heated rear seat are practically unheard of in other competitors. However, while we do like the look of the rakish rear pillars, the design somewhat cuts into rear seat headroom.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 Hyundai Sonata is truly an original that will be hard to top. From its deeply-sculpted hood to the careful use of chrome trim highlighting the beltline, there is something old-Detroit-classic about this car, a throwback to a time when designers took risks and weren’t afraid to produce something unique and dramatic. With its beautifully-detailed grille and swept-back headlights, its high belt line and sharply-raked rear window, the 2013 Sonata sedan projects a formidable presence few cars, let alone mid-size family sedans, possess. The Sonata’s wheel and tire sizes vary by trim level and range from 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers to 19-inch split-spoke alloy wheels. One of the Sonata’s more appealing exterior features is the Limited trim’s available panoramic moonroof.
Favorite FeaturesHEATED REAR SEATSWhile some luxury-oriented sedans and SUVs offer heated rear seats, it isn’t something you generally see in a mainstream mid-size sedan. And the fact that they’re standard on both the SE and Limited trim makes them even more attractive.
HD RADIOHD Radio doesn’t have the commercial-free appeal of satellite radio, but we have no qualms about a subscription-free radio service that broadcasts your favorite radio stations in CD quality. We wish more automakers offered HD Radio, and we’re glad the 2013 Hyundai Sonata offers it on all trims.
Standard FeaturesHyundai is renowned for outfitting its vehicles with a comprehensive serving of standard features, and the 2013 Sonata is no exception. Topping the list is Hyundai’s Blue Link infotainment and concierge service, Bluetooth and a USB port with iPod connectivity. Safety equipment includes six airbags, the usual sprinkling of electronic safety aides and active front headrests to help reduce the severity of whiplash-related injuries. Like many competitors in the category, the Hyundai Sonata in base form includes a 6-speed manual transmission and rides on steel wheels with full-size covers.
Factory OptionsIn addition to common equipment upgrades, such as leather seats and a moonroof, the 2013 Hyundai Sonata boasts an alluring list of optional features, which consist of a rear backup camera, a pair of premium audio systems and a navigation system with a 7-inch touch-screen and real-time traffic, weather, sports and stock updates. The once-standard panoramic moonroof is now available as part of the Limited Premium Package.
Engine & TransmissionSince both the turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and hybrid powertrain are engineered with a specific purpose in mind, the vast majority of Sonata owners will choose the balanced performance of the standard 2.4-liter direct-injected 4-cylinder. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual (in GLS trim only) or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Although it is Hyundai’s first mass-production hybrid vehicle, the Sonata Hybrid is packed with innovative tech bits. Leading the charge (pun intended) is a lithium polymer battery pack that weighs 25 percent less than a conventional nickel-metal hydride system. Moreover, the 2013 Sonata Hybrid is capable of all-electric speeds up to 74 mph – better than most plug-in hybrids. When Hyundai corrects the sluggish throttle response issues and elevates the fuel efficiency to competitive levels, we might be looking at the next leader in hybrid technology.

Read Full Review","What's New?For the 2013 model year, the Hyundai Sonata receives a handful of minor revisions to its feature content. GLS trims equipped with the Popular Equipment Package now include fog lights and heated front seats, while Limited models get a traditional moonroof in place of the previously-standard dual-panel unit. Standard heated front seats for SE trims round out the changes.
In a segment historically defined by everyday practicality and restrained styling, the 2013 Hyundai Sonata breaks the mold with its sculpted exterior design, feature-laden cabin and three efficient yet engaging 4-cylinder engine choices. Add to that an industry-leading 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, and it becomes apparent that the Sonata will continue to seize market share from well-established competitors, such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Fusion. Both the standard engine and the 274-horsepower turbocharged version employ direct-injection technology to deliver impressive fuel economy figures without sacrificing power, while the 2013 Sonata Hybrid represents the pinnacle of Hyundai fuel efficiency with its 40-mpg highway rating and lifetime-warrantied hybrid battery.

Driving the Used 2013 Hyundai ElantraThe 2013 Hyundai Elantra competently straddles the middle ground between frisky, fun-to-drive compacts like the Mazda3 and Ford Focus and the more comfort-oriented Chevy Cruze. Bland it is not, though. Hyundai’s in-house transmissions – a 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual – both work well to wring the most out of the Elantra’s 148-horsepower engine while also getting the most out of the regular unleaded gasoline it uses. Steering could use some fine-tuning in the Coupe and sedan versions for better feel, but the GT hatchback benefits greatly from Hyundai’s first application of a 3-mode driver-selectable steering adjustment. GT models also feature a sport-tuned suspension that makes the car surprisingly fun to drive on twisty roads. In everyday driving the cabin is well-insulated from wind and road noise, and the front seats are comfortable for this class of car.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Hyundai Elantra’s cabin is laid out well and easy to use. Technically, the Elantra’s interior is roomy enough to be classified as a midsize car by the EPA. The cabin is comfortable and features some soft-touch materials, but also uses some rather low-end plastics on the doors and switches. The optional navigation package gives the Elantra a more upscale feel, but other aspects, such as the clock and climate display, appear somewhat dated. The front seats are well-bolstered. Rear legroom is adequate in the sedan and Coupe, and generous in the GT. Trunk space is laudable, and the folding rear seats in the sedan and Coupe are convenient when hauling bigger items. The GT, meanwhile, features rear seats that fold flat and is a smart pick for those who regularly haul extra gear but don’t want an SUV.
Exterior StylingHyundai calls it “Fluidic Sculpture.” We just call it good-looking. The Elantra continues to evolve Hyundai’s design theme that is meant to evoke “fluid in motion.” For the sheet metal that means lots of curves, a prominent beltline along the sides and headlights that appear as if they are being drawn back into the hood. It all works without feeling gaudy. Aside from having only two doors, Coupe versions are distinguished by a large, trapezoidal mouth and twin tailpipes in the rear. The GT hatchback receives a similar treatment up front and a sloping roof that looks much more fashionable than the model it replaces, the rather bloated Elantra Touring.
Favorite FeaturesDRIVER SELECTABLE STEERING MODEThis ingenious technology enables drivers to firm up or soften the steering feel with the touch of a button. Available only on the 2013 Elantra GT for now, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this nifty feature on more Hyundais in the future.
HEATED REAR SEATSNot that long ago, just having heated front seats in a compact sedan was laudable. Coupe and GT versions of the 2013 Elantra now get those standard, while sedans can be optioned with heated rear seats, a first in this segment.
Standard FeaturesHyundai has raised the price on the 2013 Elantra sedan by over $1,300 compared to the 2012 model, but in doing so has expanded the car’s standard features. Even base, manual-transmission GLS models now come with once-optional air conditioning, 16-inch wheels, cruise control and telescoping steering wheel. Elantras also come with remote keyless entry, 4-wheel disc brakes, Bluetooth wireless connectivity and a 172-watt 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/satellite radio with USB/iPod inputs. Coupe and GT models feature heated front seats and GT models come standard with a glove compartment that can be chilled. Coupe and sedan models have six airbags, while Elantra GT versions add a seventh for the driver’s knees.
Factory OptionsUpgrading an Elantra sedan to the Limited trim model adds a power sunroof, leather seating and heated front and rear seats. In Coupe form, the upscale SE model adds a power sunroof, sport-tuned suspension and leather. A $2,000-plus Tech Package includes a 7-inch screen, navigation and 360-watt audio system. To get the Tech Package on the GT requires the $2,750 Style Package that includes a panoramic sunroof and leather seating.
Engine & TransmissionAll versions of the 2013 Hyundai Elantra are powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 148 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. The engine gives the Elantra average acceleration and decent passing power. Transmission choices are a good-feeling 6-speed manual or a very smooth 6-speed automatic that is eager to shift and feels well-matched to the engine. Automatic-transmission versions of the 2013 Elantra come with Hyundai’s manual-shifting mode, called Shiftronic, which lets drivers toggle through the gears if desired. The engine returns exceptional fuel economy, reaching 38 mpg in all sedan versions and that figure or just slightly less in Coupe and GT variants.

Just two model years after a complete redesign, the Hyundai Elantra continues to impress with its styling, fuel efficiency and bang for the buck. No longer just a scrappy rival biting at the feet of the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Ford Focus, the Elantra has won favor with consumers and critics alike, the latter naming it the 2012 North American Car of the Year. With every sedan model rated at 38 mpg/highway and Hyundai’s leading 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, the Elantra has a lot going for it.

The driver has a choice of performance options via the EV, Eco and Power buttons. In EV mode, the Prius functions solely on electric power, though speed and range are quite limited. The Power mode delivers the full potential of the gasoline engine boosted by the electric motor. The Eco mode selects throttle response for best efficiency, and will even shut down the air conditioning when at idle. The Plug-In Hybrid version operates almost exactly the same, though its electric-only range is lots longer, a rated 11 miles. Driving conservatively and taking full advantage of the regenerative braking can yield fuel consumption that tops the EPA ratings.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Toyota Prius hybrid hatchback features an interior as modern and different as its exterior. The contoured dash looks particularly handsome with its 2-tone panels, although on base models the gray-colored plastic and fabric look a little dull. The Prius’ steering wheel incorporates a wheel-like control that operates the Touch Tracer Display controlling a number of fuel-usage and hybrid-operation displays on the Prius’ LCD information screen. Plant-derived (and recyclable) plastic resins are used for the seat cushions and lower door panels.
Exterior StylingThere’s no mistaking a Toyota Prius hybrid. The 5-door hatchback’s familiar shape is not exactly head-turning, but it’s clearly efficient and slippery. Even the car’s wheel covers are aerodynamic. The roof’s apex is pushed rearward, creating a slightly sporty appearance while simultaneously maximizing rear-seat headroom. Most models ride on 15-inch wheels, but the Prius Five has 17-inchers. Plug-in Prius models feature a port on the right side where the charging cable goes, while the left side has a traditional gas cap. Plug-in models also have a distinct grille, wheels, door handles and lights.
Favorite FeaturesSOLAR ROOF PACKAGEThanks to the solar cells mounted on top, the Solar Roof Package nets you a power moonroof that self-ventilates to help keep the car comfortable. Also, the air conditioning can be remotely started to pre-cool the cabin.
POWER BUTTONAlthough the 2013 Toyota Prius hybrid is a lean, green, gas-saving machine, everyone can use a little more urge now and then. Putting the car into Power mode changes the Hybrid Synergy Drive program to get where you’re going a bit faster.

The optional power moonroof has solar-powered ventilation and remote-start air conditioning to help keep the vehicle cool. The dealer-installed Plus Performance accessory package adds a sport-tuned suspension with stiffer springs, ground effects, 17-inch lightweight alloy wheels, lower-profile tires, and a rear anti-roll bar.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Toyota Prius hybrid is powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine mated mechanically and electronically to a 60-kilowatt electric motor, all working with a continuously variable transmission and a nickel-metal hydride battery pack. Total hybrid system horsepower is 134. The Plug-in Hybrid model uses a higher-capacity lithium-ion battery that can be charged from any outlet for up to 11 miles of pure-electric operation.

Nor is the interior as polished as that of the 2013 Hyundai Accent.",15000,"Driving the Used 2013 Chevrolet SonicAround town and on the highway, the 2013 Chevy Sonic sets a new standard for subcompact driving refinement. As a whole, the offerings in this category have become less skittish and less buzzy in recent years, but Chevrolet’s Sonic for 2013 drives like a bigger, pricier car than any of its competitors. It’s not perfect, though. The up-level turbocharged engine available on LT, RS and LTZ models offers excellent fuel economy but suffers from somewhat quirky power delivery. Fortunately, the base-level 1.8-liter engine costs less, is available with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, and delivers – in some ways – a better driving experience. One of the front-wheel-drive Sonic’s best tricks is how it manages to deliver both segment-leading highway manners with impressive road-holding abilities. And, if you decide to charge a canyon road, you might be impressed by the grip and stability it delivers.
Interior ComfortInside the 2013 Chevy Sonic is a mix of conservative design with a touch of motorcycle inspiration in the form of a compact gauge cluster with a digital speedometer. Like many of the newer subcompact cars, a key highlight of the Sonic interior is simply the dearth of weak spots common to the category’s cabins only a few years ago. Worth noting are that the cup holders are good but awkwardly-placed too rearward between the front seats, the backseat is one of the category’s roomiest, and the 2-glovebox layout is especially nice for those who use a dedicated digital music player (the USB port is located in the smaller top box).
Exterior StylingThe motorcycle-inspired headlights notwithstanding, the Chevrolet’s 2013 Sonic is among the more traditionally-styled subcompact cars in the segment. While it won’t generate as much excitement as the crisper styling of the Ford Fiesta or Hyundai Accent, the flip side is that it won’t push as many people away. One fun detail to check out: On the 5-door hatchback model, Chevy’s designers ""hid"" the rear door handle in the black area of the C-pillar, in an effort to give the car a little bit of a 2-door look at first glance. Also, we love that, with the exception of the base LS trim, all models include alloy wheels.

Standard FeaturesIn sedan or 5-door hatchback form, a 2013 Chevy Sonic LS includes a 1.8-liter engine, 5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, Bluetooth, steering wheel audio controls, 4-speaker AM/FM/aux sound system and OnStar with a 6-month subscription that includes convenient turn-by-turn navigation. You might notice power windows and mirrors are missing from the list of standard equipment, but that’s not unusual for base-level subcompacts. A full range of standard safety equipment includes 10 airbags.
Factory OptionsA fully-loaded 2013 Chevy Sonic includes the 1.4-liter turbocharged engine matched with a 6-speed manual transmission or 6-speed automatic, leatherette seats, heated front seats, moonroof, cruise control and 17-inch wheels. Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment is available on LS and LT and standard on LTZ and RS. A premium 6-speaker audio system is offered on LS and standard on all others, while the LTZ with the automatic transmission comes with standard remote start. The RS trim adds leather seating, four-wheel disc brakes, performance suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels and a sport steering wheel.
Engine & TransmissionThe bad news is that the more powerful, more fuel-efficient turbocharged engine isn’t available on every trim. The good news is that the base 1.8-liter engine is a viable option with more linear power delivery. In fact, the pricier turbocharged engine’s key strength isn’t the added torque but the 5-mpg advantage in highway fuel economy. We haven’t yet tested the 5-speed manual, but we were impressed by both the 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmissions.

There’s a simplified version of the MyLink infotainment system and all Sonics gain integral blind-spot side mirrors. The LT trim adds cruise control, a USB port, second auxiliary input, steering-wheel audio controls and Bluetooth streaming audio.
Built in the USA, the 2013 Chevrolet Sonic is the second-smallest car to wear the bow-tie badge (the new Spark is officially the smallest), but its abilities are far from diminutive. Competing against Ford’s Fiesta and Honda’s Fit, among others, the Sonic delivers fuel economy that’s equal to or better than its rivals and driving dynamics that range from comfortable and nimble (LT trim) to downright sporty (new RS). Offered as a 5-door hatchback or 4-door sedan, the Sonic is no ordinary small car. It offers loads of features unexpected at this price range, such as streaming Bluetooth audio and the MyLink infotainment system that allows for control of cell phone-enabled apps.

And for those looking to turn some heads, the Camaro has plenty of show to match its go.","ConsThe 2013 Camaro’s striking visual appeal does not carry over to the interior, where inexpensive materials and hard plastics produce a rather uninspiring ambiance. Although the Chevy Camaro offers exceptional horsepower at an affordable price, the same does not necessarily hold true when it comes to handling.",24000,"Driving the Used 2013 Chevrolet CamaroWe were given the opportunity to spend equal time in every 2013 Camaro trim, from the V6-powered LS to the 580-horsepower ZL1. Admittedly, we enjoyed all the cars, but spent the lion’s share of our time testing the well-rounded SS equipped with the 6-speed manual (our gearbox of choice, as automatic transmissions feature an Active Fuel Management system that reduces horsepower output by nearly seven percent). With its ever-present torque and seemingly endless horsepower reserves, it’s easy to make the SS go fast. Aided by GM’s electronic launch control, our Camaro SS was able to tackle the zero-to-60-mph run in 4.4 seconds, a mere half-second slower than the $56,000 ZL1. On the other hand, tossing nearly two tons of American muscle around a race track required plenty of finesse, and the somewhat portly Camaro’s weight could be felt in situations demanding a high level of precision and agility. Furthermore, limited outward visibility made it difficult to judge the Camaro’s dimensions and, despite its sensible proportions, parking in tight spots was an overly frustrating task.
Interior ComfortStanding in sharp contrast to the brilliant execution of the Camaro’s exterior is its lackluster interior. Large expanses of hard plastics on the doors and center console look and feel cheap, and will likely scratch easily over time. But, what the Camaro’s interior lacks in execution it more than makes up for in design, with two large hooded binnacles housing the speedometer and tachometer, and an available gauge package comprised of oil temperature, oil pressure, volts and transmission-fluid temperature placed at the end of the center console. Some drivers did complain about the absence of any form of adjustable lumbar support for the front seats, and everyone agreed the absurdly small sun visors were all but useless when positioned to block the sun at the driver’s-side window. As for the Camaro’s backseat, let’s just say it is as small and confining as you would expect.
Exterior StylingSome cars attempt a retro feel that just looks odd or over the top, but the Camaro’s design team nailed the spirit of the original without insulting it. A stunning looker from every angle, the 2013 Camaro’s visual appeal is striking. Nowhere is this more evident than the intersection between the massive rear fenders and the crisp-edged rear roof pillar, a joining that makes a bold statement as well as a massive blind spot for the driver. The aggressive recessed grille and headlamp treatment add an air of wickedness, as does the SS model’s massive 5-spoke wheel and tire package. Rounding out the look are classic hooded Camaro taillights and a subtle rear-deck spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesSHARP EXTERIOR STYLINGCertainly beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but we are of the opinion that the 2013 Chevrolet Camaro looks like a car that could command a much higher price tag. The details like the grille, rear roof pillars and taillights are simply gorgeous.
PRACTICAL PERFORMANCECamaros of old were great in a straight line, but a lot less great around corners, especially if the road surface was uneven. The 21st century Camaro – particularly in 1LE or ZL1 form – is much more at home in those challenging situations.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Chevrolet Camaro offers both coupe and convertible body styles and over a half-dozen trim levels. While this wide array of Camaro models might seem overwhelming at first glance, Chevrolet’s trim-dependent ordering structure helps simplify the purchasing process by minimizing the number of individual options and packages. Base LS models (coupe only) include a tilt/telescopic steering wheel, 18-inch steel wheels and 6-speaker audio system with Bluetooth and a basic auxiliary audio jack, while LT versions add alloy wheels, power-adjustable front seats and Chevrolet’s new MyLink audio system interface with a 7-inch touch-screen. Stepping up to the SS model will get you 20-inch alloys, a limited-slip differential and, most importantly, the 426-horsepower V8. Safety and security equipment consists of six airbags, GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability control and emergency/concierge services via OnStar embedded telematics.
Factory Options2013 marks the triumphant return of the 1LE package, and brings with it massive 20-inch 10-spoke wheels with high-performance tires, track-tuned suspension and revised gearing. Outside of conventional niceties such as navigation, heated seats and xenon headlights, the 2013 Camaro offers a wealth of appearance enhancements ranging from racing stripes to ground effects. LT and SS models take personalized styling to the next level with the available Dark Special Edition package, which adds an extra dose of sinister to the Camaro with halo rings for the headlights, Blue Ray Metallic paint and a 2-tone interior color scheme.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Camaro offers four engine choices: A 323-horsepower 3.6-liter direct-injected LFX V6, 400-horsepower 6.2-liter L99 V8 with Active Fuel Management, 426-horsepower 6.2-liter LS3 V8 and a 580-horsepower supercharged LSA V8. The V6 and the LSA can be backed by either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The L99 is accompanied by a 6-speed automatic with steering wheel-mounted paddle-shift control, while the LS3 has a 6-speed manual.

There was a time, not long ago, when muscle cars and high fuel prices were about as compatible as oil and water. But, despite record fuel prices, the 2013 Chevrolet Camaro and other modern muscle cars continue to defy the odds and post strong sales numbers. Boasting impressive horsepower and mpg to match, the Camaro is a spirited performer that’s also reasonably practical for everyday use. The fierce rivalry with the fellow domestics, the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger, is back in full swing, as each manufacturer offers efficient yet powerful standard powertrains plus high-horsepower performance variants. From the fun-loving convertible models to the near super-car performance of the mighty Camaro ZL1, there is a Chevy Camaro flavor for just about every need and budget.

The fully-boxed frame results in a rigid chassis that helps improve handling and reduce interior noise. The coil-over-shock front suspension and rack-and-pinion steering contribute to a surprisingly maneuverable and tractable vehicle. We also give high marks to the standard StabiliTrak electronic stability control because it’s a meaningful safety aid that can reduce single-vehicle accidents. With 320 horsepower, the Tahoe’s 5.3-liter V8 is more than capable of moving the fully-loaded vehicle easily and responsively, and the Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation seamlessly switches between 4- or 8-cylinder operation as needed for improved fuel economy without compromising performance.
Interior ComfortInside the 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe, we see more hard plastic surfaces than we’d prefer but that’s probably inevitable given the vehicle’s vast interior expanse. We like the seat sew patterns, the soft leather seating option and the elegant dash with its blue-backlit controls and white-backlit instruments. Accessing the Tahoe’s third-row seats is made simple, either by activating the power release fold-and-tumble mechanism on the standard second-row bench seat or via the walkway between the optional captain’s chairs. We also appreciate the available heated-seat feature for the second row and the excellent touch-screen-operated navigation system.
Exterior StylingConservative but nicely-sculpted sheet metal is set off by the Tahoe’s expressive Chevrolet-family face, consisting of twin horizontal grille sections separated by a big Chevy bow-tie badge. The power-bulge hood and big wheels and tires (up to 20-inchers) give the Tahoe a substantial road presence, an attitude that becomes particularly CIA-like when it’s finished in black. The Tahoe’s flush headlamps, smooth wrap-around bumper, lower air dam and steeply-raked windshield all contribute to its low 0.363 coefficient of drag, a number that lets this big rolling brick of a vehicle slip through the wind with relative ease.
Favorite FeaturesSMOOTH, QUIET RIDEWith its boxed frame, high-tech suspension and precise steering – plus generous sound dampening – the 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe offers a luxury-car-like riding and driving experience.
ACTIVE FUEL MANAGEMENTHelping you have your cake and eat it too, this system smoothly drops out four cylinders when they are unneeded, enhancing fuel efficiency.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Chevy Tahoe includes boatloads of standard features. Even the base LS model offers dual-zone (manual) air conditioning, 6-way power driver’s seat, StabiliTrak stability control, OnStar, Bluetooth, tire-pressure monitoring and airbags everywhere: Front and side for the front seats and head-curtain bags for all rows. The LT group adds tri-zone automatic air conditioning, heated front seats, power-adjustable pedals, Bose 9-speaker audio system and ultrasonic rear parking assist. Stepping up to the LTZ trim adds 20-inch aluminum wheels, heated and cooled 12-way memory front seats, 10-speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound audio system and Autoride rear air-assisted load-leveling.
Factory OptionsBeyond the three trim packages, the Chevrolet Tahoe can also be optioned up to a great degree. Among key options are an engine-block heater, rear-seat entertainment center with DVD player, Z71 Off-Road Package, Side Blind Zone Alert System, rearview camera system and a navigation system and radio that includes CD, MP3 and XM NavTraffic compatibility. A choice of 2- and 4-wheel-drive models and a variety of axle ratios and trailering packages are also offered.
Engine & TransmissionThe Tahoe’s sole engine offering is a strong, smooth and sophisticated 5.3-liter V8. In the interest of performance with efficiency, it employs variable valve timing, Active Fuel Management (cylinder deactivation that cuts off four cylinders when they aren’t needed) and Flex Fuel capability. When running on E85 (85-percent ethanol and 15-percent gasoline), fuel economy suffers by about 25 percent but power and torque increase slightly. To save weight, aluminum cylinder heads are used, and the engine block is either aluminum or cast iron depending on other equipment ordered. The transmission is a 6-speed automatic. The 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid uses a 6.0-liter V8 working with a 2-mode electric motor/generator.

Read Full Review","What's New?The Chevy Tahoe has no major changes for 2013. It just gets a higher-capacity battery and a couple of new exterior colors, and the grade braking function, which uses engine compression to help slow the vehicle when going down hills, now works in the normal transmission mode instead of only in the Tow/Haul setting.
Big space and big capabilities have made the 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe America’s favorite full-size SUV. Properly equipped, the brawny body-on-frame vehicle, based on a truck-type construction, can seat up to nine passengers, tow 8,500 pounds and manage well off-road. That keeps the Tahoe at the head of its class, which includes the Ford Expedition, Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada. Delivering EPA highway fuel-economy figures in the low 20-mpg range, and including in its lineup (along with its sibling, the GMC Yukon) the only hybrid in the segment, for its size the Chevy Tahoe is about as efficient as can reasonably be expected. But, unless you will actually use the Tahoe’s towing capacity and off-road capabilities, a large unit-construction crossover, such as the Ford Explorer, Dodge Durango or Chevy’s own Traverse, is a much more efficient, and more sensible, alternative.

Driving the Used 2013 Nissan RogueAfter spending the better part of a week in a 2013 Nissan Rogue SV with all-wheel drive, we came away with mixed feelings. The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine felt adequately peppy, but when we needed that extra burst of power for passing or climbing elevations, it just wasn’t there. Nissan’s Xtronic CVT transmission proved smooth and consistent, and definitely made the most of the little engine’s powerband while returning good fuel economy. Although the CVT is a gearless transmission, Nissan engineered artificial shift points that mimic a conventional transmission. The only time the CVT’s true nature is revealed is during wide-open throttle. In this condition, the CVT holds the engine’s rpm steady as the vehicle accelerates, creating a loud and somewhat harsh engine note. On winding back-country roads we found the 2013 Nissan Rogue quite happy to play, with good feedback through its electric power-assisted steering. Body lean and bounce were also quite carlike, an attribute we chalk up to the Rogue’s Nissan Sentra underpinnings.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Rogue’s interior is characteristically Nissan, with simple and straightforward instruments, subtle seating fabric and lots of soft-touch finishes. The Rogue has a terrific set of comfortable contour-forming front seats, which are heated and covered in quality leather on SL models. Front-seat legroom is good for tall drivers, as is headroom. Unfortunately, the rear-seat passengers don’t have the same luxury, especially when the front seats are pushed all the way back. Storage space is ample in the little Nissan Rogue and includes an oversized glove compartment as well as a hidden cargo area behind the rear seat If we have one gripe with the Rogue’s design, it’s the large D-pillar that, while creating a cool and sporty exterior look, creates a sizable blind spot for the driver.
Exterior StylingSharing its platform with the Nissan Sentra Sedan gives the 2013 Nissan Rogue the ride and handling of a car in the body of small SUV. The distinctive front grille and lower air intakes bear a slight resemblance to the larger Nissan Murano, and the alloy wheels and chrome door skirts seem to take after Nissan’s performance-oriented Maxima and 370Z. SV trims get bigger wheels and tires, as well as additional exterior enhancements including chrome exhaust outlets, roof rails and rear privacy glass.
Favorite FeaturesAROUND VIEW MONITORUntil recently, keeping your head on a swivel was the best way to successfully parallel park a car. By utilizing a series of external cameras to create a composite view of the vehicle’s surroundings, the Nissan Rogue’s available Around View Monitor gives you eyes on the back – and side – of your head.
XTRONIC CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION (CVT) Nissan is one of the few automakers to still embrace and refine CVT technology, and this 2nd-generation transmission is incredibly smooth and provides the 2013 Rogue with decent performance as well as laudable fuel economy.

SV models add a power-adjustable driver’s seat, premium fabric seating surfaces and a 6-speaker audio system with a 4.3-inch full color display and a USB port for portable music players. As is the case with most Nissan models, the Rogue’s steering wheel does not include a telescoping function. Standard safety equipment is comparable to most other small SUVs, but not exceptional.

Driving the Used 2013 Audi A4If the BMW X3 is about speed and the Lexus RX favors comfort, the Audi Q5 splits the difference. This automotive Goldilocks is comfortable and quick, with the latter characteristic helped by the new supercharged V6 engine under the hood. If you want to fine-tune your driving experience, say, for more agility and speed or overall comfort, the 2013 Q5’s suspension and engine response can be modified with the touch of a button on V6 models with the Audi drive-select feature. The comfortable driver’s seat offers a commanding view. The Q5 is nimble in corners, but steering is a bit heavy at low speeds. The Audi Q5 hybrid offers a smooth transition between its electric motor and gasoline engine, but with mileage estimates of 24 mpg city/30 highway, it’s not that much more miserly than 4-cylinder Q5 models, which begin about $15,000 less than the admittedly loaded hybrid version.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Audi Q5’s interior is just as elegant as the SUV’s outer skin. In fact, one might say the cabin dazzles even more with its emphasis on technology and, by default, bevy of buttons. Unlike some competitors, leather is standard even on base models, and tri-zone climate control will keep occupants front and back at the proper temperature. The shift lever and its surrounding cadre of buttons, knobs and dials would look at home in a private jet, while the optional wood grain lends a more classic feel. The Q5’s roomy rear seats fold in a flexible 40/20/40 arrangement.
Exterior StylingEven in a sea of luxury SUVs, the 2013 Audi Q5 stands out with its brilliant looks. From its massive, trapezoidal grille to its well-proportioned rear with twin tailpipes, the Audi is a picture of form and function. LED lights abound, from the optional daytime running lights up front to the standard LEDs in the taillights and those in the side-mirror-mounted turn signals. At 7.9 inches, even the Q5’s ground clearance is a good balance between road-going sedan and mountain-climbing beast, which allows the Q5 to tackle both twisty pavement and snow- or dirt-covered roads.

When it comes to features, that moniker mostly fits the bill, as even that version comes with leather seating, 18-inch 5-spoke wheels, 3-zone automatic climate control, AM/FM/CD player with 10 speakers, and hill-descent control. Surprisingly, you’ll still have to pay extra for Bluetooth on base models. Stepping up to Premium Plus and Prestige trims brings heated front seats, iPod integration, auto-dimming rearview mirror, panoramic sunroof, xenon headlights, power tailgate, and a memory setting on the driver’s seat.
Factory OptionsFor those willing to spend the money, a 2013 Q5 can become a seriously high-end vehicle. Among the extras found as options or incorporated within trim levels are a Nappa leather-clad instrument panel, 14-speaker/505-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system, rear-seat entertainment package, adaptive cruise control, and high-tech systems with navigation, rearview camera and a 3G network that turns the Q5 into a rolling Wi-Fi hot spot. One particularly ingenuous feature is an available thermo cup holder that can warm or cool drinks so your latte stays hot and your soda remains cold.
Engine & TransmissionThree engine options are available in the 2013 Audi Q5. A 211-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder is standard on lower trims. For those wanting the most power, there is a 272-horsepower supercharged V6. The most fuel-efficient Audi Q5 is the hybrid, which pairs a turbo 4-cylinder with a battery pack and electric motor to make a total of 245 horsepower and attain up to 30 mpg. All 2013 Q5 models are linked to a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode. All Q5 models are all-wheel drive and are rated to tow up to 4,400 pounds. All three powerplants require premium fuel.

Read Full Review","What's New?In addition to some front- and rear-end design tweaks, the big news for the 2013 Audi Q5 is a new supercharged V6 engine that replaces the naturally aspirated one, and a hybrid powertrain that pairs a turbocharged 4-cylinder with a lithium-ion battery pack and electric motor.
The 2013 Audi Q5 is a compact luxury SUV that offers an impressive balance of comfort, performance, style and fuel economy. While just four years old, this 5-passenger SUV has quickly become Audi’s number-2 seller behind the A4. A new – albeit pricey – hybrid variant arrives for 2013 in addition to a more powerful V6 engine or the potent-yet-efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder found in base models. The Q5 stands out from rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz GLK, Lexus RX, Cadillac SRX, Infiniti EX and Acura RDX with its standard all-wheel drive and laudable towing capacity of up to 4,400 pounds.

Those who use their van as a mobile workshop might find the taller cabins of the Nissan NV or Mercedes-Benz Sprinter a better fit.",25000,"Driving the Used 2013 Chevrolet Express 1500 CargoWith only 195 horsepower on hand, the Chevy’s 2013 Express Cargo Van’s V6 engine might offer the best fuel economy on paper, but we’re willing to bet that the amount of work this engine has to do to keep a fully loaded van moving will likely return figures more in line with the more powerful and preferable 310-horsepower 5.3-liter V8. Of course, really big jobs are best tackled either by the 6.0-liter V8 engine or the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V8. With its 525 lb-ft of torque, there isn’t much that Duramax can’t haul, and its longevity and reliability will likely appeal to fleet managers trying to get the most out of their investments. On a 3500 model with the Duramax engine, Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) is 9,900 pounds with a 9,700-pound tow rating.
Interior ComfortIn its purest form, the Chevy Express Van for 2013 is a 2-person rig with a massive metal cave residing behind the very supportive high-back front bucket seats. An empty canvas, the Express Van’s cargo bay can be configured by any aftermarket customizer, or by taking advantage of Chevy’s many option packages that include flip-up access panels that allow easy access from outside the van to the rack-mounted tools inside. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the Express Passenger Van that allows for such luxuries as power windows, additional seating, carpet, navigation, rear air conditioning and Bluetooth.
Exterior StylingLet’s face it, when the ultimate interior configuration of a vehicle is basically a giant elongated cube, there’s not a whole lot of leeway for shaping the exterior. Still, Chevy has modernized its big van with rounded corners, high-mounted taillights and stylish truck-like wheels. The 2013 Chevy Express Van’s grille may be its most ornate feature, resembling the trademark look that adorns Chevy’s big pickup trucks. Door options include sliding or split swing-out side doors, and split rear doors with or without windows. Handy exterior accessories include a roof-mounted ladder rack, roof-rack cross-rail system, and mud flaps.
Favorite FeaturesSIDE ACCESS DOORSThe Chevy Express Van’s side doors provide easy access to the cargo area without having to climb in from the back.
CAPABILITYConsider the 2013 Express Van to be a jack-of-all-trades, one that can carry up to 15 people, boasts 284.4 cubic feet of cargo space, and tows up to 9,900 pounds.
Standard FeaturesListed among the Chevrolet Express Cargo Van’s standard features are a V6 engine, vinyl flooring and upholstery, air conditioning, a step-up rear bumper and manually operated exterior mirrors. Frills are not part of the deal, though the Passenger Van does jazz things up some, with a V8 engine and cloth seats. All 2013 Chevy Express models are equipped with stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. Passenger vans features side-curtain airbags covering the first three rows.
Factory OptionsCreature comforts are not what you’d call plentiful on the 2013 Chevy Express Van, so shoppers will need to look to the options list if they want power windows and door locks or, if they’re really feeling crazy, a radio. There are also choices of engines, light-duty (Express 1500) or heavy-duty (Express 2500 and 3500) models, body lengths and various packages. Some of the more noteworthy options include navigation, a rearview camera, rear park assist, Bluetooth connectivity and the most recent version of OnStar.
Engine & TransmissionIf fuel economy is a primary concern, a 2013 Chevrolet Express 1500 Cargo Van equipped with the base 4.3-liter V6 is a buyer’s best choice. That 6-cylinder is expected to average 20 mpg on the highway, but with 195 horsepower, it’s not exactly a powerhouse. Though less efficient, the Express Van’s four available V8s promise to get most any job done with up to 324 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. There is also a CNG (compressed natural gas) conversion for the 6.0-liter gasoline engine that includes hardened valve seats and a special 3-tank fuel-tank configuration. The 3500 vans can be equipped with stump-pulling power of the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel.

When it comes to moving big payloads, few vehicles are as up to the task as the full size 2013 Chevrolet Express Van. Dressed for passenger service, the Express Van crushes the largest of SUVs, providing seating for up to 15 people. Switch to the cargo van and the Express Van offers up a massive 285-cubic-foot cargo hold. It also can be outfitted as a rolling workstation. The 2013 Chevy Express Van also makes for a pretty nice conversion van. Knowing that no matter what the mission, the Express Van will need to be prepared, Chevrolet has given its van a beefed-up suspension, available extended-length cabs, a choice of gasoline or diesel engines and even the option of all-wheel drive (AWD).

A huge back seat and cavernous trunk are definite pluses, but it’s the Legacy’s sure-footed standard AWD, impressive crash test ratings and excellent fuel economy that we love.","ConsIf you’re looking for a sportier sedan, even the 6-cylinder Legacy isn’t as much fun to drive as a turbocharged Hyundai Sonata or VW Passat. The 2.5i’s rubbery manual transmission won’t impress enthusiast drivers, and the lack of a touch-screen infotainment system may turn off younger buyers.",21000,"Driving the Used 2013 Subaru LegacyWhile the 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines in the 2013 Subaru Legacy offer differing acceleration, the Legacy 2.5i, and 3.6R share the same suspension, meaning the ride and handling are fairly consistent regardless of model. We found the Legacy’s ride to be exceptionally smooth and its cabin sufficiently quiet. The boxer engine’s low center of gravity coupled with all-wheel drive make for stable handling with a slightly sporty edge. The newly improved 2.5-liter engine’s 173 horsepower provides adequate though unspectacular acceleration and passing, though its optional CVT works better than most and features a set of paddle shifters that allow manual-style gear changes. Fuel economy with the CVT is actually quite a bit better than with manual, and you’ll get a more sophisticated AWD setup to boot. The 3.6R is, as expected, better at moving the Legacy, but with a sizeable penalty in fuel economy (18/25 vs. 24/32). 
Interior ComfortThe spacious interior in the 2013 Subaru Legacy is elegant in both its design and function. The front seats are superbly comfortable and, on all but the base model, include one of the best driver-seat lumbar supports we’ve tested. Legroom and headroom are excellent front and rear, and split-folding rear seats expand the cargo space from large to huge. The thick tilt/telescoping steering wheel includes controls for audio and cruise, as well as Bluetooth. Gauges are stylish, legible and include a trip computer and fuel-economy gauge; Limited trims have an electroluminescent cluster with a proper temperature gauge.
Exterior StylingFor 2013, the Subaru Legacy’s styling gets a bit sportier, touting a newly designed grille, wheels and front bumper. Other than wheels, foglights and, on all but the base model, color-keyed mirrors, there is little to distinguish the five trim levels. Unlike its Outback cousin, the Legacy sits low to the ground-a design that permits it to appear like any other family sedan but also somewhat limits its ability to engage in deep snow. However, features like the available windshield wiper de-icer solidify the Legacy’s winter warrior credentials.
Favorite FeaturesNEW VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION UNITAvailable only on Limited trims, Subaru’s new voice-activated navigation system includes a 7-inch high-resolution screen, rearview camera and Bluetooth hands-free phone and streaming music capability. The system also includes a 440-watt harman/kardon sound system, single-disc CD player, HD radio, USB auxiliary audio input, XM Satellite with NavTraffic and iPod integration.
EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSIST SYSTEMAvailable on the Limited trim, the Subaru’s EyeSight system includes Pre-Collision Braking, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure and Sway warning, and a pedestrian-detection system.
Standard FeaturesFeatures on the 2013 Legacy 2.5i sedan include all-wheel drive, a 6-speed manual transmission, 16-inch wheels, USB/iPod control and Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming. A 6-cylinder 3.6R version is similar, though with a 5-speed automatic and 17-inch alloy wheels. The 2.5i Premium models include the CVT transmission, a 10-way power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and 6-speaker audio. The 2.5i and 3.6R Limited trims add a power passenger seat, dual-zone climate control, the All-Weather Package (heated front seats, mirrors and windshield wiper de-icers), leather seats, a 440-watt harman/kardon premium sound system, rear A/C vents, and an electroluminescent gauge cluster with 3.5-inch LCD information display.
Factory Options2013 Subaru Legacy options are clustered according to trim. The base 2.5i offers only the CVT automatic, while the Premium trim can be equipped with the All-Weather Package, 440-watt harman/kardon audio system, a power moonroof and rearview camera package. Limited trims offer voice-activated navigation with rearview camera, as well as the EyeSight system and a power moonroof. Subaru dealers also offer a relatively wide array of accessories including an auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a remote starter, all-weather floor mats, puddle lights and a roof rack system with numerous attachment options.
Engine & TransmissionFor 2013, the Legacy’s 2.5-liter boxer engine is upgraded with Dual Active Valve Control driven by a timing chain (as opposed to a rubber belt). The result is a few more horsepower and better low-end torque response, as well as quieter operation. Equipping this engine with the literally seamless CVT automatic will produce the best fuel economy (24/32 mpg city/highway), but the 6-speed manual is a better choice if saving money is a bigger priority. The most refined engine choice for the Legacy is the 3.6-liter 6-cylinder, which offers strong acceleration and passing power, but with a bit less fuel efficiency. Manual-equipped cars feature a mechanical viscous coupling center differential that splits torque in a constant 50/50 front-to-rear configuration. Legacys equipped with an automatic transmission use a more sophisticated electronic setup that, on the 3.6R, can even vary the torque split according to need.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2013, the Legacy sedan gets a minor facelift, a stiffer suspension and upgraded radios with Bluetooth. The Limited can be equipped with Subaru’s EyeSight driver assist (Pre-Collision Braking, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Departure Warning), as well as a new navigation system. Lastly, a new 2.5i Sport trim level supplants last year’s 2.5GT variant.
For 2013, Subaru’s Legacy sedan continues to win consumers with its pleasant styling, roomy rear seat and unbeatable all-wheel-drive (AWD) setup. Despite the AWD’s added weight and power demands, the 4-cylinder Legacy manages very respectable fuel economy ratings of 24-mpg city and 34-mpg highway, when equipped with continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Add to this class-leading safety and resale ratings, and it becomes nearly impossible to argue against buying a Legacy. One deterrent might reside with the Legacy’s rather basic audio systems, which while equipped with Bluetooth phone connectivity and streaming audio, are a far cry from the latest in high-tech infotainment. If you’re seeking touch-screen radios that not only allow voice control of the iPod, but popular apps as well, you’ll be happier in a sedan from Ford, GM or Hyundai.

Extensive use of acoustic laminated glass, active noise-cancellation technology and triple-sealed doors creates an interior that is nearly Lexus-like at highway speed. Powering the 2013 GMC Terrain SUV is a competent 4-cylinder engine admittedly better at impressing with its fuel economy than its passing prowess. For those who want more power, there’s the new 3.6-liter V6 of 301 horsepower, 272 lb-ft of torque and EPA highway fuel-economy ratings in the mid-20s.
Interior ComfortAlthough it shares much in common with the Chevy Equinox, the 2013 GMC Terrain strives to distinguish itself with more high-quality materials, such as satin metal trim and two-tone leather seating. The Denali takes things even further with French-stitched seams, smoked mahogany trim and an 8-way power passenger seat. GMC’s signature glowing red instrument panel looks particularly fetching in the Terrain, with backlighting for just about every conceivable switch or button. Even the USB port features a lighted surround making it easier to locate in the dark. There’s also a touch-screen radio that uses smart phone-like icons to operate the screen functions.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 GMC Terrain compact SUV shuns the rounded, wavy look so popular among small crossover SUVS today, opting instead for a rugged, almost Hummer-like profile. Strong angular wheel arches and a huge 3-bar grille with block GMC lettering and chrome cap are the first things that will catch your eye, but definitely not the last. Optional 19-inch wheels make a bold statement, as do the sturdy roof-rail racks perfect for holding kayaks, bikes, skis, surfboards or a cargo carrier. GMC’s 2013 Terrain isn’t terribly tall off the ground, making it easy to get in and out of, as well as to reach the roof.
Favorite FeaturesHEATED CLOTH SEATSHeated seats aren’t often seen without a leather interior. The seats in the 2013 GMC Terrain can be programmed to begin warming when the vehicle is turned on via remote start, which always makes for a more comfortable start to the day on a cold winter morning.
MOVEABLE SECOND ROW SEATSThe Terrain’s entire second row can be moved forward or back eight inches, allowing for taller passengers to gain more legroom or for parents to pull kids in car seats significantly closer.
Standard FeaturesThe base GMC Terrain compact SUV for 2013 comes equipped with a 182-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with 6-speed transmission, 17-inch wheels, rearview camera, color touch-screen radio with a USB port and iPod support, Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity, XM Satellite Radio, OnStar, six airbags and a sliding rear seat that can move fore and aft nearly eight inches. Inside, ambient lighting sets the interior’s mood, and Active Noise Cancellation – the projection of sound waves through the speakers to counteract loud exterior noises – helps keep the interior quiet.
Factory OptionsPopular options include a 3.6-liter V6 engine and larger 19-inch alloy wheels. Looking to keep the kids quiet on a long trip or just while out running errands? Add the rear-entertainment system with two independent screens. Also available is a new color touch-screen navigation system incorporating all of the IntelliLink features, a 10-gigabyte music storage hard drive, Pioneer sound system and a programmable rear liftgate that can be set to open to a lower height. Is safety a big concern? Add the Lane Departure Warning and Forward Collision Alert (standard on SLT-2 and Denali) or the Side Blind Zone Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert (Denali only).
Engine & TransmissionPowering the 2013 GMC Terrain is either a 182-horsepower in-line 4-cylinder or a new, 301-horsepower V6. Both benefit from direct injection and are mated to 6-speed automatic transmissions, and deliver excellent fuel-economy numbers.

Entertained, because it does everything well: All controls feel direct and responsive, and the behavior is stable and refined. Disappointed, because we wish this latest iteration of the Beetle had the more spirited dynamics of VW’s GTI, one of our all-time favorites. The Beetle seems tuned for a softer ride and less aggressive handling, though truthfully, most drivers won’t mind. The 2.5-liter 5-cylinder base engine is adequate, but we prefer the 2.0-liter turbo-4, which delivers lusty performance with little penalty in fuel economy. The new diesel engine changes the character of the car some, as its thrust lives low in the rev bend, but it’s still entertaining. The 2013 VW Beetle feels like one solid piece whether you’re going down the road or carving up mountain passes.
Interior ComfortThe instrument panel of the 2013 Volkswagen Beetle is simply one of the best. It recalls the original Beetle’s rounded edges and curving shapes, it’s a testament to clean design, and it shows the sort of classical timelessness exemplified by, say, a 1959 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. The entire layout inside the Beetle celebrates function, with all the necessary controls and information displays arranged for ready access. Case in point, the Beetle Convertible’s power soft top activates with the touch of a button, even while traveling at speeds up to 18 mph.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 VW Beetle looks bigger in the metal than it does in photos, so many people expect something more compact. Actually, the overall form owes more to the original Beetle than to the ""New Beetle"" of the last several years. Where the previous model was very rounded, with a high-arching roofline, this version is lower, certainly more aggressive-looking and has a stronger family resemblance to its earlier ancestors, particularly in the side profile and window treatments. We think this is a good thing, as the car looks more assertive and more firmly planted on the pavement.
Favorite FeaturesINTERIOR LAYOUTToo often, efforts to evoke the past in modern incarnations do an injustice to both the past and the present. But the 2013 VW Beetle’s interior layout and instrument panel salute the original Beetle while managing to be attractive, functional and up-to-date.
POWERTRAIN CHOICESThe 2013 Beetle’s base 2.5-liter 5-cylinder is completely satisfactory, but the 2.0-liter turbo-4 is a real stormer throughout its rev range, and our preference. For the truly economy-minded, the new-for-2013 2.0-liter TDI turbodiesel offers exceptional fuel economy and impressive low-speed torque.
Standard FeaturesThe 2.5L, Turbo and TDI models each come in three trim levels. The 2.5L model has 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth, Leatherette seating and stability control. Moving up to the 2.5L w/Sunroof adds (surprise!) a sunroof, satellite radio, Premium VIII audio and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The ""Sun, Sound and Nav"" package brings 18-inch alloy wheels, a Fender Premium Audio System, a trip computer and navigation with touch screen. Similar progressions happen with the Turbo and TDI lines, though the sportier Turbo starts with 18-inch alloy wheels and ""Cross Differential"" limited-slip system, and ends up with 19-inch alloy wheels and bi-xenon headlights.
Factory OptionsSince the Beetle add-ons are largely grouped into trim-level packages, the only additional options are minor items having to do with vehicle protection, floor mats and graphics treatments. But one item worth special mention, if you can pop for one of the top-line trims, is the terrific Fender Audio System. It’s easy to operate and delivers great sound. If you’re an audiophile, you need to check this out.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2013 Volkswagen Beetle 2.5L is a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder available with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L is rated at 170 horsepower and delivers perfectly acceptable, if not exactly soul-stirring, performance. There are two commendable optional 4-cylinder engines. The 2.0-liter Turbo, a favorite of ours in other VW models, makes 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Fitted with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG automatic, this inline-4 delivers performance that is more than just spirited. The Beetle TDI’s 2.0-liter turbodiesel delivers 140 horsepower and a very impressive 236 lb-ft of torque, and is matched with a 6-speed manual or Tiptronic automatic transmission.

Available in hardtop and convertible models, Volkswagen’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel engine posts some impressive numbers: 236 lb-ft of torque and 28/41 city/highway mpg. Also, the Beetle Fender Edition, a special trim package presented in cooperation with the iconic electric-guitar maker, is currently available through dealer order.
The 2013 Volkswagen Beetle is the kind of car you buy not because you need it, but because you absolutely want it. Nowhere is this reality more strongly represented than in the new Beetle Convertible. As a “boutique” car, the VW Beetle delivers heavily on style, image, emotional appeal and ownership that transcend mere transportation. This niche segment could reasonably include the likes of the Mini Cooper, Fiat 500, Hyundai Veloster, and even the sibling VW GTI. Yet, the 2013 Beetle is an attractive selection in its own right, with all the mechanical, technological and feature benefits you would expect from Volkswagen. It’s powered by a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder, a 2.0-liter turbo-4 powerhouse or a new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel, and wrapped in the most familiar shape on the road.

Subaru fans who love the rugged capability of the XV Crosstrek, but require slightly more interior volume should consider its bigger brother, the Subaru Outback.",23000,"Driving the Used 2013 Subaru XV CrosstrekThough it is largely based on Subaru’s latest small-car platform, the XV Crosstrek feels exceptionally stable and secure on the open road. Road imperfections and undulations are well absorbed, and the up-sized brakes provide plenty of stopping power for the relatively light XV Crosstrek. The electric-assisted power steering lacks feedback, but the light effort makes low-speed parking maneuvers a cinch. The 148-horsepower engine, however, has a difficult time hauling more than two passengers, and the continuously variable transmission (CVT) exacerbates engine noise under hard acceleration. To that end, drivers looking to haul more than a few hundred pounds should search for a more powerful alternative. Still, the prevailing impression is one of suitable refinement and comfort.
Interior ComfortBarring a few minor details, the XV Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza share the same interior layout. While material quality is below average for the segment, panel gaps are narrow and consistent throughout the cabin. The rear seats offer sufficient legroom for average-sized adults and fold flat to yield 51.9 cubic feet of cargo space – considerably more than the Nissan Juke. The dashboard’s center stack is home to user-friendly controls and a handy lower storage compartment for mobile phones and other small items. If possible, we recommend avoiding the optional navigation system, as the outdated interface can be extremely frustrating to operate.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 XV Crosstrek shuns the utilitarian look of many ""compact"" SUVs in favor of a more aggressive, dynamic design. The look is spearheaded by Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, while prominent over-fenders and unique starfish alloy wheels combine to project an athletic stance. With 8.7 inches of ground clearance and fairly steep approach/departure angles, the Subaru XV Crosstrek is well-equipped for travel in unforgiving terrain. Moreover, the lower body panels are wrapped in rugged plastic cladding for additional protection against various obstacles encountered on unpaved roads.
Favorite FeaturesSTANDARD SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVEUnlike most competitor all-wheel-drive systems, Subaru’s trademark symmetrical AWD continuously sends power to all four wheels to help prevent a loss of traction before it happens. Additionally, Subaru symmetrical AWD incorporates a compact design to optimize both fuel economy and handling performance.
PARTIAL ZERO EMISSIONSUntil recently, hybrid and alternative-fuel vehicles were the sole recipients of the EPA’s Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (PZEV) rating. The Subaru XV Crosstrek achieves PZEV status without the need for costly alternative-fuel technology.
Standard FeaturesThe 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek is offered in two trim levels: Premium and Limited. Premium models include roof rails, heated front seats, a multi-information display and a 6-speaker sound system with Bluetooth and a USB port for portable MP3 players. Stepping up to the Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, leather, rearview camera, auto-on/off headlights and Subaru’s new 4.3-inch touch-screen audio system with HD Radio. Despite the $25,000 price tag, Limited models do not offer power-adjustable front seats. Occupant protection comes in the form of seven airbags, rollover mitigation control and sure-footed traction of symmetrical all-wheel drive.
Factory OptionsSince the majority of features are tied to trim level, the XV Crosstrek’s short list of options includes a power moonroof, touch-screen navigation with a 6.1-inch display and host of stand-alone accessories. Given the substandard sound quality produced by the standard audio system, we highly recommend upgrading to the dealer-installed speakers from Kicker.
Engine & TransmissionThe lone engine choice for the 2013 XV Crosstrek is a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed ""boxer"" 4-cylinder engine that churns out 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV Crosstrek sends power to all four wheels via a standard 5-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Premium models equipped with a manual gearbox feature an AWD system with a 50/50 front/rear power distribution, while automatic transmissions are coupled to an adaptive system that automatically proportions power to the wheels with the most grip.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2013 XV Crosstrek is a brand-new nameplate in the Subaru lineup and looks to make a name for itself in the small-SUV segment by way of impressive fuel economy, stylish sheetmetal and go-anywhere capability.
In the automotive world, downsizing has long been synonymous with downgrading. While this notion is often far from true , most of today’s compact SUVs have swollen to near mid-size proportions, which in turn spawned a new series of small SUVs that actually live up to their namesake. The all-new 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek is among this new breed of right-sized SUVs, offering a wealth of upscale features, nimble handling and ample cargo space at an affordable price. Rivals such as the Nissan Juke and Mini Countryman deliver engaging on-road performance and laudable fuel economy, but the new XV Crosstrek supplements its solid road manners with a surprising level of off-road proficiency and the best fuel economy of any all-wheel-drive (AWD) SUV on the market.

But don’t wait: This is the Avalanche’s final year of production.","ConsIf you don’t need the midgate feature, you can get the same utility from a full-size crew-cab pickup and probably save some cash in the process. If you don’t need the towing ability or size afforded by the Avalanche but still like the pickup-bed/SUV-cab idea, check out the Honda Ridgeline.",37000,"Driving the Used 2013 Chevrolet AvalancheDespite its size and obvious pickup-truck roots, the 2013 Chevrolet Avalanche delivers an impressive level of refinement in ride and handling. Over smooth roads, the suspension seems to float along, almost like an old Caddy or Lincoln. When the road starts to turn, however, you’ll need to pay attention as the bulky Avalanche isn’t exactly light on its feet. The standard StabiliTrak stability control is a welcome addition. The 5.3-liter V8 is plenty strong, but because the power is delivered through the 6-speed Hydra-Matic transmission with such smoothness, acceleration can sometimes feel slower than it actually is. The 2013 Chevy Avalanche’s steering is on the light side, but not effortless, and the vehicle has an impressively tight turning circle.
Interior ComfortThe 2013 Chevrolet Avalanche truck can seat up to six passengers, but we think five is a more realistic number for serious travel. The thickly padded seats offer outstanding comfort and are positioned high up to give everyone a good view out. A massive center console with generous storage compartments separates the front bucket-style seats and is large enough to fit a tablet or large purse. The rear seats have good head and legroom for tall passengers, and the folding rear seatback exposes the midgate panel pass-through. For even more room, the rear glass can also be removed.
Exterior StylingThe centerpiece of the Chevy Avalanche’s design is its folding midgate bulkhead separating the cabin from the cargo bed. With the midgate open and the second seat folded, the 2013 Chevy Avalanche’s usable cargo length grows from 63 inches to 98. The bed itself features a protective liner and storage boxes along the bed walls. A 3-piece interlocking cargo cover is optional. All 2013 Avalanches get Black Diamond badging, recognizing the truck’s final year of production. Visually, the Avalanche is a handsome hybrid of the Suburban SUV and Silverado pickup, with distinctive flying-buttress sail panels.
Favorite FeaturesACTIVE FUEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMChevrolet is not alone in offering cylinder deactivation, but it’s a welcome addition to these heavyweight vehicles, which are known for consuming substantial quantities of gasoline. Four of the engine’s cylinders are shut down under light-load conditions.
MIDGATE CONFIGURATIONPickup-truck fans might shun the 2013 Chevrolet Avalanche’s short cargo bed (63 inches) and SUV foundation, but the midgate gives it a degree of versatility that’s absent from traditional pickups. The only drawback is that dropping the midgate to extend the cargo area also opens the cabin to the elements.
Standard FeaturesIn base LS trim, the 2013 Chevy Avalanche includes remote keyless entry, heated power mirrors, a cloth-upholstered 40/20/40 split-bench front seat with power on both the driver’s and passenger’s sides, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, head-curtain side-impact airbags and 17-inch aluminum wheels. Rear park assist, power adjustable pedals and fog lights are added to the LS model this year, and a rearview camera is added to LS and LT models. The LTZ model has Autoride suspension (with automatic damping adjustment), a limited-slip differential, 20-inch wheels and leather seating.
Factory OptionsThe Off-Road Package includes 18-inch wheels, the off-road suspension, tubular assist steps, locking rear differential and a skidplate package. Available articulated running boards automatically move downward and outward as the doors are opened. Individual options, depending upon trim level, include a navigation system, DVD back-seat entertainment system with an 8-inch screen, power sunroof, SiriusXM satellite radio with real-time traffic assist for navigation-equipped models and 18-, 20- or 22-inch wheel options.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Chevy Avalanche offers only one engine and transmission choice: a Vortec 5.3-liter V8, matched to a 6-speed 6L80 Hydra-Matic transmission. The engine can operate on gasoline or E85 (a mix of 85-percent gasoline and 15-percent ethanol), although fuel economy is greatly reduced when using E85 while horsepower is increased slightly. Under appropriate light-load conditions, Active Fuel Management Technology lets the engine run on four cylinders to save fuel. The 2-wheel-drive (2WD) trucks use an iron-block version of this engine while the 4WD trucks have an aluminum block to partially offset the added driveline weight.

The 2013 Chevrolet Avalanche truck is part pickup, part SUV and entirely practical. Its big, roomy cabin is virtually identical to the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban, from the second-row seat forward. Out back is a pint-size 63-inch cargo bed. A unique folding midgate bulkhead between that bed and the flip-down rear seat extends the cargo area into the cabin, providing many more options for hauling bigger loads. Built on the same platform as the Suburban, the 2013 Avalanche full-size truck is endowed with the same strong chassis, ground clearance and available 4-wheel drive (4WD) as its SUV cousin. Chevy has announced that 2013 is the Avalanche’s last year.

The interior is quiet, the view out the front is expansive, and the brakes, 3-mode steering and smooth 6-speed automatic transmission steadfastly refuse to call attention to themselves. The ride is soft and compliant, but without a hint of marshmallowiness. The Santa Fe’s 3.3-liter V6 engine offers 290 horsepower, but only 252 lb-ft of real hardworking torque, and it makes that torque at higher revs than the competition. Swift takeoffs and passes aren’t an issue in the front-drive Santa Fe – especially since the 2013 Santa Fe is significantly lighter than its competition. When the all-wheel drive system is added, however, climbing hills and making mid-range passes (40-60 mph) feel more like work.
Interior ComfortThere’s plenty of room in the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe and the driver’s view to the front is panoramic (the rearward view is less broad, but you’re never reduced to driving purely with the mirrors). The base Santa Fe’s stain-resistant cloth fabric feels good, plus the audio and climate-control knobs and buttons are glove-friendly big. All the materials are impressive right down to the rubber that lines the inside of the door pulls. The first two rows are completely livable for adults, while the third row is a decent kid’s row. The Santa Fe does give up some cargo area compared to the competition, however.
Exterior StylingLooking for all the world like what it is – an extended-wheelbase Santa Fe Sport without the sporty rear-side-window kick-up – the new Santa Fe has more to say about handsome, contemporary styling than it does about swooping lines that characterize the shapes of Hyundai passenger cars. Nice touch 1: Even in base Santa Fe GLS form, the outside mirrors and bumpers are body color. Integrated fog lights, roof rails and 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels are the exterior differences between the GLS and upscale Limited versions. Nice touch 2: The Santa Fe GLS gets smaller 18-inch wheels, but they, too, are aluminum-alloy.
Favorite FeaturesHYUNDAI BLUE LINKBeyond the expected concierge services, SOS emergency assistance, news, weather, and turn-by-turn navigation help, Blue Link’s 3-level telematics system includes a parent-centric app that sends you a text if your Santa Fe is driven over a preset speed, past a curfew time, or beyond a preset ""geofence"" perimeter.
PANORAMIC SUNROOFA one-touch power tilt/slide sunroof is cool, but one with a sky-view that spans all three rows is triple cool.
Standard FeaturesSanta Fe GLS drivers with a long journey ahead will appreciate the multi-adjustable front bucket seats with power-adjustable lumbar support. Passengers further back will give thanks to the 3rd-row controls for the air conditioning and heating. Stepping up to the Santa Fe Limited includes luxuries like leather seating – power-adjustable and heated for the driver and front-passenger – pushbutton starting and heated captain’s chairs for the second row. The Limited also upgrades the audio system with a 4.3-inch color display and adds a rearview camera. Sweet as ever, Hyundai’s confidence-inspiring 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranties cover the new Santa Fe.
Factory OptionsBeyond a laundry list of individual options like a heated steering wheel, navigation system, premium audio, and all-wheel drive, Hyundai is pushing option packages. For the Santa Fe GLS, the $4,100 ""Leather and Navigation Package"" includes leather and navigation (duh) and a host of comfort and convenience upgrades. The Limited’s $2,900 ""Technology Package"" scores you navigation and a 12-speaker Infinity Logic 7 audio system, plus that wow-inspiring Panoramic Sunroof, a heated steering wheel, and manual rear-side-window sunshades. Sadly for mom and dad, no rear-seat-entertainment/DVD pacifier is available on the 2014 Santa Fe (but an iPad or two would be cheaper than most such systems, anyway).
Engine & TransmissionHyundai makes it simple to shop for a 2014 Santa Fe: one engine, one transmission. In front-drive form, the SUV’s 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 is very well matched to the 6-speed automatic transmission, with good throttle response, smooth pickup, and clean, easy shifts. The all-wheel-drive Santa Fe, though, could do with some more low-end grunt to get it moving. All that said, the 2014 Santa Fe is comfortable towing up to 5,000 pounds of trailer, boat, or anything else you’d like to haul.

If you’re going to enter an SUV race against heavy hitters like the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer, or all-new blood like the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder, you’d better be ready to run. The new-for-2013 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV is an extended version of the 2-row, 5-passenger Santa Fe Sport, offering more room, three rows of seating for six or seven, standard V6 power, and a competitive offering of standard comfort and optional equipment. Available in front-wheel-drive and optional all-wheel-drive configurations, the 2014 Santa Fe, offered in GLS (base) and Limited (upscale) trim levels, is priced – in classic Hyundai fashion – a few hundred-dollar notches below the competition while delivering a stylish exterior and a high-quality interior with plenty of huggable comfort and convenience.

Best look to a Subaru Forester or Honda CR-V.",20000,"Driving the Used 2013 Kia SportageThe 2013 Kia Sportage’s taut suspension and powerful engine choices put the ""sport"" in Sport Utility Vehicle. Compared with its nearest competitors, the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, the 2013 Kia Sportage SUV rides a bit stiffer, but delivers better cornering and recovery from sharp dips in the road. The taut suspension delivers predictable response to rapid inputs and quick adjustments and the nicely-weighted steering wheel helps minimize the amount of play in the steering. The 2.4-liter and 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engines both offer ample power in any driving situation, with our favorite being the turbocharged version in the Sportage SX. The 2.4-liter is more than capable in climbing steep hills and handling quick passing maneuvers, but the turbocharged 2.0-liter adds a new level of driving fun. The 2.0-liter turbo also feature gasoline direct injection technology that helps it attain good fuel economy without sacrificing power.
Interior ComfortFunctionally, there is much to like inside the 2013 Kia Sportage SUV, with a big, roomy rear seat that can be folded flat to make a modestly-roomy 54.6 cubic-foot cargo hold. While useful, the Sportage’s cargo bay is not quite as large as those in the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, both of which offer more than 70 cubic feet of cargo space. EX trims feature special anti-bacterial cloth that helps eliminate odors and stains that can accumulate over time. We like a number of the Sportage’s interior options, but the panoramic sunroof’s manual sunshades don’t strike us as very useful and should be power operated.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 Kia Sportage SUV’s sleek design includes sharp lines, narrow side glass and Kia’s signature ""tab"" front grille. The clever interplay between the dark lines surrounding the grille, lower air ducts and painted wheel inserts gives the Sportage a keenly sinister appearance. The Sportage’s high beltline and big wheel-and-tire combo make it look a bit like a hopped-up VW GTI. Don’t be fooled by the Sportage’s sporty appearance, however, as its available all-wheel drive (AWD) and nearly seven inches of ground clearance make it a capable compact SUV.

Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Kia Sportage SUV’s 2.4-liter engine is robust and fuel-efficient and should suffice for most drivers’ needs. Costing a bit more is the turbocharged 2.0-liter, which provides V6-like power and 4-cylinder fuel economy. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, which delivers impressive fuel-economy numbers and can be shifted manually.

In evolutionary terms, the 2013 Kia Sportage is as far removed from the original 1993 Sportage as we are from our Neanderthal cousins. No longer a rugged off-road SUV, the current Sportage rides atop a car platform, has a sophisticated engine and suspension setup, and is loaded with safety and creature comforts more common to luxury cars than compact SUVs. Competing against the likes of the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4, the 2013 Kia Sportage sets itself apart in the areas of styling, ride and handling and price.

The Explorer’s limited 5,000-pound tow rating may also be a deal killer.",29500,"Driving the Used 2013 Ford ExplorerIt takes only a few minutes of seat time in the 2013 Ford Explorer to realize this is no ordinary SUV. The rigid unit body has none of the squeaks and rattles so commonplace in most truck-based SUVs, while Ford’s Curve Control throttle intervention helps maintain a safe speed when rounding sharp corners. The Explorer’s adept suspension is aided by a host of electronic assists designed to make this mid-size SUV handle like a lithe sport sedan. Our short time testing the Terrain Management 4-wheel-drive system netted some pretty impressive results, especially considering the Explorer’s modest 7.6 inches of ground clearance and somewhat soft suspension. Still, we wouldn’t put this vehicle up against a Toyota 4Runner, for example, whose body-on-frame architecture and hi/lo transfer case make it more conducive to serious off-road challenges. Then again, few truck-based SUVs can match the 2013 Explorer’s outstanding fuel economy, exceptional cabin comfort, user-focused functionality and class-leading connectivity.
Interior ComfortLook inside most trucked-based SUVs and you’ll find the same utilitarian dash and door panels as their pickup truck counterparts. Not so with the 2013 Ford Explorer, where an elegant cabin is awash in high-quality, soft-touch surfaces. The Explorer’s instrument cluster is clean and simple on the base models and, on the XLT and Limited, it can be upgraded to include the MyFord Touch package that features configurable LCD screens in place of the traditional analog gauges. At the rear, a single-piece rear liftgate opens to expose 15.7 cubic feet of cargo space, which can be expanded to a maximum of 80.7 cubic feet by folding down both rows of rear seats.
Exterior StylingWith the 2013 Explorer, Ford has jettisoned the boxy, upright design of old and replaced it with an elegant body highlighted by a boldly-rakish front end. The Explorer’s tall doors and lower roof give it a slick, almost low-rider look, as do the Sport and Limited’s 20-inch wheels. But, the design is an optical illusion because there is plenty of headroom inside as well as ground clearance below (7.6 inches to be exact). The Explorer’s wide track benefits interior occupants with more hip and shoulder room, as well as greatly aids in improved handling and cornering.
Favorite FeaturesMYFORD TOUCHThis latest version of Ford’s driver-connect technology is standard on the Explorer Limited and available on the XLT. It utilizes an expanded version of the automaker’s SYNC voice-command system to allow and facilitate a broader range of input commands for the audio, navigation, climate control and phone systems.
CURVE CONTROLA world-exclusive, this standard safety enhancement automatically senses when the vehicle is entering a given corner too quickly and automatically engages throttle and braking intervention to help it maintain the desired driving path.
Standard FeaturesIn addition to its V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, the 2013 Ford Explorer boasts numerous power assists, MyFord driver connectivity, AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio with media hub, air conditioning, cruise control, tilt/telescoping steering column and more. The XLT adds auto headlights, foglights, 18-inch wheels, rearview camera with zoom function, premium cloth upholstery, SIRIUS Satellite Radio, SecuriCode keyless-entry pad and the SelectShift feature. Leather-upholstered, the Limited gets all that and the XLT’s Driver Connect and Comfort Packages – plus a Sony premium audio system with HD Radio. Safety items include AdvanceTrak with Roll Stability Control and Curve Control and Hill Start Assist.
Factory OptionsFor 2013, all Ford Explorers offer 4-wheel drive with multi-mode Terrain Management System and Hill Descent Control. XLT buyers can add the Driver Connect (MyFord Touch/SYNC, premium audio, dual-zone climate control and rearview camera). The Limited’s Luxury Seating Package (perforated leather, heated/cooled front seats, power-folding third-row seat, power liftgate and navigation) is available with or without the 302A Group (Blind Spot Information System, adaptive cruise control, Auto Park, HID headlamps and rain-sensing wipers). Stand-alone options for the XLT, Limited and Sport models include navigation, dual-panel power moonroof, power liftgate, inflatable second-row outboard seatbelts, power tilt/telescopic and heated steering wheel and the blind spot system.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2013 Explorer’s standard engine is Ford’s high-tech 3.5-liter Ti-VCT (twin-independent variable camshaft timing) V6 that makes 290 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. With the 6-speed automatic this engine delivers class-leading 17/25 mpg city/highway EPA numbers in front-drive Explorers and 17/23 mpg in the 4WD versions; it also accelerates from zero to 60 mph in roughly eight seconds and gives the Explorer a 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity. Optional on front-drive models is the new 2.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine that makes 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, but is recommended to use premium fuel. Fuel economy ratings for the EcoBoost are an estimated 20 mpg city and 28 mpg highway. The Sport gets a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost engine rated at 350 horsepower.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2013, a new Sport trim joins the Explorer fleet, offering a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, standard 4-wheel drive, 20-inch sport alloy wheels and two-tone leather-trimmed seats. New features for the Explorer include a passenger-side front knee airbag, available heated steering wheel and auto-dimming headlights.
When Ford introduced the all-new Explorer last year, it didn’t just do a slight refresh of the existing model. Instead, Ford created an entirely new vehicle unlike any Explorer before it. For 2013, the Explorer continues to attract new buyers swayed by its sleek, almost Land Rover-like good looks, cutting-edge technology and efficient engine choices, including the first turbocharged 4-cylinder engine ever to grace an Explorer engine bay. With seating for seven, the Explorer is definitely family-friendly and, thanks to an advanced multi-setting 4-wheel-drive system, the family can now venture confidently off-road (something the old Explorer wasn’t very good at). Ironically, the one vehicle that stands to lose market share to the Explorer is its own sibling, the Ford Flex.

Additionally, if a third pedal is a requirement in your next luxury-sports sedan, the 5 Series is the only car in the category to offer a manual transmission.","ConsCompared to the Acura TL and Lexus GS, the pricing structure for the 2013 5 Series is rather complex. Where fully loaded models from Lexus and Acura maintain sensible sticker prices, opting for a 5 Series with all of the trimmings can easily double the base price.",48000,"Driving the Used 2013 BMW 5 SeriesRegardless of drivetrain – rear-wheel (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) – the 2013 BMW 5 Series family provides a balanced approach to over-the-road performance. And when equipped with AWD, BMW’s mid-size offering is blessed with ""all-weather"" performance, going tough when the going gets tough. With your choice of a turbocharged-4, a turbo inline-6 or a pair of twin-turbo V8s, you can truly tailor a BMW 5 Series to your specific performance requirements and, of course, budget. The entry-level 528i is blessed with a surprising amount of urge (0-60 in 6.2 seconds), a modest appetite for fuel (22 mpg city/32 highway) and a throaty – almost lusty – personality on the open road. With that, the sweet spot is probably where the 5 Series began, with a healthy turbo-6 (535i) propelling you at triple-digit speeds (where allowed).
Interior ComfortThe 5’s interior space has grown slightly over the years, while the overall impression has grown almost exponentially. Already a strong suit, BMW paid special attention to ergonomics in the latest 5 Series, with all displays, knobs and buttons located in the central portion of the cabin. And the choice of interior materials reflects a new maturity on the part of BMW management; considering this is where consumers spend most of their time, the new upgrades are fully appropriate to that. We’d take issue, however, with the standard-spec upholstery; black or beige Leatherette, on a car with a base price of over $48K, stretches – we think – credibility.
Exterior StylingIn assessing the 5 Series, it’s helpful to have some background. The development of its chassis and body structure was performed in conjunction with the flagship 7 Series. As a result, the 5 is more grown-up, with the longest wheelbase ever to be found on today’s 5 Series. The proportions and overall impressions of this current 5 Series aren’t radically different from those of its predecessors, but if you liked the smaller footprint of the previous iteration, the new 3 Series might be worth your consideration. In contrast, the 5 Series sedan’s architectural limitations make the spacious Gran Turismo variant an enticing proposition for anyone who needs a 5 Series with SUV-like cargo space.
Favorite FeaturesACTIVE STEERINGThe 2013 BMW 5 Series sedan is available with an integral active-steering system that, depending on vehicle speed, aims the rear wheels in the same or opposite direction of the front wheels for improved handling in both low- and high-speed driving conditions. 
M SPORT PACKAGEDesigned for those who wish to squeeze every ounce of performance from their 5 Series sedan, the M Sport Package ups the ante with a sport suspension, lightweight 18-inch alloy wheels and a higher electronically limited top speed.
Standard FeaturesIn sedan or 5-door body style, every 2013 BMW 5 Series includes 10-way power front seats, an 8-speed automatic transmission, run-flat tires, xenon headlights that produce up to three times the light of conventional halogen systems and BMW’s iDrive infotainment system paired to a 10-speaker audio system. Unlike the Infiniti M and Acura TL, the 5 Series sedan does not offer leather seating or a moonroof as standard fare. As expected, the 2013 5 Series is packed with a full range of active and passive safety features, including six airbags, adaptive brake lights that become brighter as braking forces increase and BMW Assist with automatic collision notification, emergency assistance and concierge services.
Factory OptionsWhether you plan to inject an extra measure of performance or refinement into your 5 Series, BMW offers a variety of appealing stand-alone options and packages to do so. On the performance side, Dynamic Damper Control enhances the overall ride quality by automatically adjusting the suspension characteristics according to the current road conditions, while the available M Sport Package adds 18-inch performance wheels and tires, aerodynamic bodywork and a race-inspired M steering wheel. Luxury and convenience options include a full-color head-up display and active front seats designed to help reduce the fatigue associated with long trips by gradually altering the height of the seating surface.
Engine & TransmissionVariety, thy name is 5 Series. With the introduction of a new 4-cylinder turbo, BMW offers a ""holy trinity"" of turbocharged powertrains. Despite its ""base"" designation, the 2.0-liter four is one of the finest engines ever fitted to an entry-level vehicle. It delivers 240 horsepower, 260 lb-ft of torque and 32 mpg in the EPA’s highway cycle. Perhaps the lack of an available manual transmission with the turbo-4 is a down note, but that absence can’t last forever; the rumble for its return starts right now. The turbocharged inline-6 and its more powerful hybrid counterpart have their fans, while the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 and the higher-output M variant seem to maintain the notion that too much power is never enough.

Read Full Review","What's New?For 2013, the new 560-horsepower M5 joins the 5 Series lineup along with a number of minor performance and cosmetic enhancements. Leading the list of changes is a next-generation navigation system with weather forecasts and crowd-sourced traffic information, newly available bespoke features from BMW Individual and a 45-horsepower bump for Gran Turismo variants sporting the twin turbo V8.
Vehicles with a production history of more than a few decades typically have a model generation they would rather forget. But, like a perpetual-motion machine, the BMW 5 Series just keeps gaining momentum. To meet the specific demands of the modern car buyer, the 2013 BMW 5 Series offers the most expansive lineup in the nameplate’s history. Along with recent additions like the powerful yet fuel-efficient ActiveHybrid 5 and the versatile 5-door Gran Turismo, 2013 marks the highly anticipated debut of the fifth-generation M5 super sedan. In response to the challenges posed by the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6, Infiniti M and the new Lexus GS, the BMW 5 Series has once again raised the bar to secure its place as the benchmark in the mid-size luxury segment.

ConsIf you want an economical 2-door with plenty of room for four occupants and all their stuff, there are better choices than the 2013 Beetle. The back seat is a little cramped, the low roof line detracts from interior room, the sleek shape cuts into trunk capacity, and there are certainly less-expensive alternatives.",20000,"Driving the Used 2013 Volkswagen JettaDriving the 2013 Beetle, we are both entertained and disappointed. Entertained, because it does everything well: All controls feel direct and responsive, and the behavior is stable and refined. Disappointed, because we wish this latest iteration of the Beetle had the more spirited dynamics of VW’s GTI, one of our all-time favorites. The Beetle seems tuned for a softer ride and less aggressive handling, though truthfully, most drivers won’t mind. The 2.5-liter 5-cylinder base engine is adequate, but we prefer the 2.0-liter turbo-4, which delivers lusty performance with little penalty in fuel economy. The new diesel engine changes the character of the car some, as its thrust lives low in the rev bend, but it’s still entertaining. The 2013 VW Beetle feels like one solid piece whether you’re going down the road or carving up mountain passes.
Interior ComfortThe instrument panel of the 2013 Volkswagen Beetle is simply one of the best. It recalls the original Beetle’s rounded edges and curving shapes, it’s a testament to clean design, and it shows the sort of classical timelessness exemplified by, say, a 1959 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. The entire layout inside the Beetle celebrates function, with all the necessary controls and information displays arranged for ready access. Case in point, the Beetle Convertible’s power soft top activates with the touch of a button, even while traveling at speeds up to 18 mph.
Exterior StylingThe 2013 VW Beetle looks bigger in the metal than it does in photos, so many people expect something more compact. Actually, the overall form owes more to the original Beetle than to the ""New Beetle"" of the last several years. Where the previous model was very rounded, with a high-arching roofline, this version is lower, certainly more aggressive-looking and has a stronger family resemblance to its earlier ancestors, particularly in the side profile and window treatments. We think this is a good thing, as the car looks more assertive and more firmly planted on the pavement.
Favorite FeaturesINTERIOR LAYOUTToo often, efforts to evoke the past in modern incarnations do an injustice to both the past and the present. But the 2013 VW Beetle’s interior layout and instrument panel salute the original Beetle while managing to be attractive, functional and up-to-date.
POWERTRAIN CHOICESThe 2013 Beetle’s base 2.5-liter 5-cylinder is completely satisfactory, but the 2.0-liter turbo-4 is a real stormer throughout its rev range, and our preference. For the truly economy-minded, the new-for-2013 2.0-liter TDI turbodiesel offers exceptional fuel economy and impressive low-speed torque.
Standard FeaturesThe 2.5L, Turbo and TDI models each come in three trim levels. The 2.5L model has 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth, Leatherette seating and stability control. Moving up to the 2.5L w/Sunroof adds (surprise!) a sunroof, satellite radio, Premium VIII audio and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The ""Sun, Sound and Nav"" package brings 18-inch alloy wheels, a Fender Premium Audio System, a trip computer and navigation with touch screen. Similar progressions happen with the Turbo and TDI lines, though the sportier Turbo starts with 18-inch alloy wheels and ""Cross Differential"" limited-slip system, and ends up with 19-inch alloy wheels and bi-xenon headlights.
Factory OptionsSince the Beetle add-ons are largely grouped into trim-level packages, the only additional options are minor items having to do with vehicle protection, floor mats and graphics treatments. But one item worth special mention, if you can pop for one of the top-line trims, is the terrific Fender Audio System. It’s easy to operate and delivers great sound. If you’re an audiophile, you need to check this out.
Engine & TransmissionThe base engine in the 2013 Volkswagen Beetle 2.5L is a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder available with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L is rated at 170 horsepower and delivers perfectly acceptable, if not exactly soul-stirring, performance. There are two commendable optional 4-cylinder engines. The 2.0-liter Turbo, a favorite of ours in other VW models, makes 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Fitted with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG automatic, this inline-4 delivers performance that is more than just spirited. The Beetle TDI’s 2.0-liter turbodiesel delivers 140 horsepower and a very impressive 236 lb-ft of torque, and is matched with a 6-speed manual or Tiptronic automatic transmission. The TDI offers remarkable around-town get-up-and-go and thrifty fuel economy.

Also, the Beetle Fender Edition, a special trim package presented in cooperation with the iconic electric-guitar maker, is currently available through dealer order.
The 2013 Volkswagen Beetle is the kind of car you buy not because you need it, but because you absolutely want it. Nowhere is this reality more strongly represented than in the new Beetle Convertible. As a “boutique” car, the VW Beetle delivers heavily on style, image, emotional appeal and ownership that transcend mere transportation. This niche segment could reasonably include the likes of the Mini Cooper, Fiat 500, Hyundai Veloster, and even the sibling VW GTI. Yet, the 2013 Beetle is an attractive selection in its own right, with all the mechanical, technological and feature benefits you would expect from Volkswagen. It’s powered by a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder, a 2.0-liter turbo-4 powerhouse or a new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel, and wrapped in the most familiar shape on the road.

On uneven or rough pavement, the 2012 Chevy Malibu is able to absorb all but the harshest road imperfections while maintaining its composure, never giving in to wheel hop or chatter. We tend to like the driving dynamics of the V6 models more than the 4-cylinder cars due to the conventional hydraulic power steering setup. The 4-cylinder Malibu uses a fuel-save electric-assist power steering setup that feels a bit detached and lacks good on-center feel. GM’s fuel-efficient 6-speed automatic is a welcome addition to the Malibu lineup and offers paddle shifters for more spirited driving. 
Interior ComfortAlthough in its final year in this form, the 2012 Chevy Malibu sedan’s interior doesn’t look old or dated. The smart ""dual-cockpit"" instrument panel is made of quality plastics that fit together well. Upper-trim models feature two available 2-tone trim combinations-Ebony and Brick, and Cocoa and Cashmere-with metallic-look or wood-grain accents. Cool blue backlighting illuminates the Malibu’s gauge cluster, while warmer ambient lighting resides in the foot wells and in the LED overhead pin lighting that projects onto the center console. Abundant storage space is provided throughout the 2012 Chevy Malibu’s interior, most notably in the deep center console bin and in the covered storage bin atop the dash. Helpful for laptop or video-game use is the available 110-volt AC power outlet. As for interior space, the Malibu provides excellent legroom for tall passengers, although the headroom for such folk is far better up front than in the rear seat.
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Chevrolet Malibu sedan displays taut proportions, finely tailored sheet metal and definitive style that is pure Chevrolet. With its wheels pushed to the furthest corners, the Chevy Malibu presents an image of stability and strength; the design also stretches the car’s wheelbase to its maximum limit creating a larger and roomy interior. The Malibu’s short deck lid opens to reveal a larger and deep trunk, with a low lift-over height for easy loading. In LTZ form, the Malibu sedan is even more distinctive with front foglights and clear-lens LED taillights. V6 models are easily distinguished by their twin chrome exhaust outlets.

Many critics believed GM could never build a mid-size sedan to compete with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. But, the 2012 Chevrolet Malibu sedan has made believers out of the most strident GM-bashers and given the entire mid-size segment a loud wakeup call. Chevy’s Malibu is a stylish sedan with a handsome, intelligently laid-out interior, a choice of fuel-efficient 4- or 6-cylinder engines, and a penchant for driving. Unfortunately, Chevrolet does not offer a hybrid Malibu, leaving green-friendly drivers to shop the Fusion, Sonata, Optima or Camry hybrids. If the 2012 Malibu mid-size sedan falls short in one area, it’s the car’s entertainment and communications offerings. Unlike the Ford Fusion, the Malibu doesn’t offer a SYNC-like system and there is no factory navigation option, although turn-by-turn directions are available through the OnStar system. If these things are an important part of your car-buying decision, you may want to hold off a bit longer when the all-new 2013 Malibu sedan arrives.

Driving the Used 2012 Chevrolet CorvetteThe 2012 Chevrolet Corvette is a genuine driver’s car. Thanks to a host of high-tech electronic performance enhancements, the C6 Corvette rounds corners and responds quicker than any previous Corvette. The 6.2-liter V8 engine is never short on power, requiring only a slight tap of the accelerator to release its fury. You don’t need to have muscle to handle this muscle car because the 2012 Chevy Corvette coupe’s power steering turns with little effort yet returns excellent on-center feel and guidance. All three of the suspension packages – a base system, Magnetic Ride Control and the Z07 Performance package – are designed to satisfy a wide range of driving styles, from the casual weekend cruiser to the hard-core track enthusiast. In the sport mode the Corvette grabs the pavement with tenacity, and in touring mode it soaks up road harshness like a large luxury sedan.
Interior ComfortWhile we are certain that the 2012 Chevrolet Corvette can compete on almost any race track with almost any competitor, its interior does not compete as well. Even with the partial microfiber suede coverings provided in the new Chevrolet Centennial Edition, the Corvette’s cockpit seems more Camaro-quality than Audi or BMW. It’s not a horrible interior, but it does speak to the Corvette’s Chevrolet roots. A handsome Custom Leather-Wrapped Interior Package (part of the 4LT Package) is well worth the extra cost, adding a dash of elegance to Chevrolet’s road warrior. The newly designed front seats add additional side support and remain fairly comfortable even on long drives. One must remember, however, that this is a V8-powered performance car, so those looking for Lexus-like quiet in the cabin will be in for a rude awakening. 
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Chevrolet Corvette coupe is unlike any Corvette before it, yet it retains a familiar look. That’s because this sixth-generation Corvette draws inspiration from the 1968 C3 design, although this model has exposed headlamps and much shorter front and rear overhangs. The Corvette Grand Sport model borrows many of the design elements from the Corvette Z06, creating a thrilling-looking coupe for around $55,000. A traditional feature that is standard on the Corvette coupe is the removable body-colored roof panel, which is also available in tinted glass. There is even a package that offers one of each. The ultimate in Corvette design is the 2012 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, a super-car edition that adds its own unique body panels, and a combination of 19-inch front wheels and 20-inch rears, among other features.
Favorite Features6-Speed TransmissionChevrolet’s latest short-throw 6-speed manual transmission makes the shifter in past Corvette models feel like something pulled out of a 1966 Chevy pickup.
Keyless Access with Push Button Start Keep your keys in your purse or pocket. When you approach the car, you simply reach for a touch-panel in the door handle and the vehicle starts up with the press of a button.
Standard FeaturesThe 2012 Chevrolet Corvette coupe features a 430-horsepower, 6.2-liter V8 engine, 6-speed manual transmission, traction control, limited-slip rear differential, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes (ABS), side-impact airbags, xenon headlamps, AM/FM stereo with CD/MP3 capability, auxiliary input jack, SiriusXM satellite radio, OnStar, color-keyed removable roof panel, dual-zone air conditioning, Driver Information Center (DIC), keyless access with push-button starter, leather seats, 6-way power driver’s seat, cruise control, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel and 18- and 19-inch front and rear alloy wheels, respectively. The Corvette Grand Sport adds wider fenders, special wheels, revised suspension settings, Z06-style front splitter and rear spoiler, larger brakes and specific manual transmission gear ratios. (Specific rear-axle ratios are available on automatic-transmission models.) The Z06 adds a race-inspired 505-horsepower, 7.0-liter V8, revised front end, wider rear fenders, 18-inch front and 19-inch rear 10-spoke wheels and a track-inspired suspension. The ZR1 brings a 638-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter V8 and a 205-mph top speed.
Factory OptionsOptions include a paddle-shift 6-speed automatic transmission, Head-Up Display (HUD), Bose audio with 6-disc in-dash CD/MP3 player, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, Turn-by-Turn and DVD navigation, Magnetic Selective Ride Control, dual-mode exhaust system, transparent roof panels and polished alloy wheels. Also available is the Custom Leather-Wrapped Interior Package, which adds padded door armrests, custom embroidery on the dash and headrests and two-tone leather-wrapped pieces to the upper and lower instrument panel, door pads and seats. A new Chevrolet Centennial Edition package is similar to the Leather package, but includes suede-like inserts and custom Carbon Flash Metallic paint. The Corvette Z06 offers a number of performance enhancement options including the Z07 Performance Package which adds Brembo ceramic brakes, Magnetic Ride Control, larger Michelin Pilot Sport Cup Zero Pressure track-ready tires Performance Traction Management and 20-spoke wheels (19-inch front and 20-inch rear). The CFZ Carbon Fiber Package includes a black carbon fiber splitter and a ZR1-style full-width rear spoiler. 
Engine & TransmissionAlthough there is no denying the pleasure a 430-horsepower (436 horsepower with the optional dual-mode exhaust) V8 delivers, with the 2012 Chevrolet Corvette has a certain lack of refinement. The 6.2-liter LS3 small-block V8 feels gruff at idle and roars loudly when pressed into action. It’s a purely American feel that instantly takes one back to the late 1960’s muscle car era. Porsche and Jaguar lovers will probably never like this engine, but they can’t easily overlook its tremendous performance potential, either. The Z06’s 7.0-liter V8 pushes the level of performance and refinement into the realm of the European supercars. The Corvette ZR1’s supercharger allows its 6.2-liter V8 to produce an incredible 638 horsepower and 604 lb-ft of torque.

The Corvette Z06 is available with an enhanced Z07 Performance Package with race-track-ready Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tires and a new Performance Traction Management system, which manages torque delivery to put all that power to the pavement. The Corvette ZR1 receives these same upgrades in the new PDE performance package.
There is only one Chevrolet Corvette. It’s an American original that has weathered the best and worst of times. The 2012 Chevrolet Corvette offers even more driving enthusiasts to love. With horsepower and handling to rival some of Europe’s greatest super cars, the made-in-America 2012 Chevrolet Corvette continues to offer superior performance at a fraction of the price of those super cars.

And if you enjoy the Jeep-specific pursuit of boulder hopping, this newest iteration of the Wrangler – and newish iteration of the four-door Unlimited SUV – won’t disappoint.","ConsThe 2012 Jeep Wrangler is engineered to deliver credible off-road SUV capability. To that end, its on-road demeanor is necessarily compromised. Both its separate frame and live axles (front and rear) enhance off-road performance, while compromising on-road stability (heavier unsprung weight from live axles) and performance (heavier curb weight – typically – with a separate frame) when compared to today’s pavement-specific crossover SUVs.",23,"Used 2012 Jeep Wrangler PricingJeep’s Wrangler continues to be the most democratic of off-road SUV choices, with a base price of under $23K (two-door, with destination) unchanged from 2011. That said, the Wrangler Unlimited is some $3,500 more expensive, and an upscale Sahara or Rubicon can easily approach – or exceed – $40,000. To the Wrangler’s credit, it enjoys historically high resale value, with three-year-old examples projected to return almost 60 percent of their original window sticker. Should you consider a 2012 Jeep Wrangler for aggressive off-roading, the top-of-the-line Rubicon, even with a Monroney of $40,000, is an absolute steal when comparing its investment to that of upgrading a lesser Wrangler through the four-wheel-drive aftermarket. And all of the Rubicon’s off-road capabilities make tackling the toughest trails remarkably easy, leaving the driver with little to do but stay awake.
Driving the Used 2012 Jeep WranglerThe best part about the 2012 Jeep Wrangler is that it remains – in the end – a Jeep, with the aforementioned separate body-and-frame construction, live axles front and rear, and enough ground clearance to drive over a (large) sleeping dog without doing damage to dog or drivetrain. With that menu of perceived negatives for on-road performance, Jeep engineers have done a remarkable job of taming the beast within, endowing this newest Wrangler SUV with steering that actually steers, and a suspension that remains in regular contact with the paved surfaces beneath it. Off-road, the 2012 Wrangler is everything you want in a four-wheel-drive trail rig, given its ability to poke along at walking speed. And if the logging trail allows – or the evening’s destination calls for it – you have the ability to get up-and-running in no time. Add real horsepower to the crawling, and favorable gearing for the hauling, and you arguably have the most competent Jeep Wrangler in the CJ’s 70-year history.
Interior ComfortThe Jeep Wrangler interior was extensively upgraded for the 2011 model year. To that end, few changes have been necessary – or incorporated – for 2012. Our test Wrangler, a Sahara Unlimited SUV trimmed in Black/Dark Saddle leather, was just this side of sumptuous. Lower in the food chain is the base Sport, whose cloth-covered perches can best be described as functional. And although the Wrangler Unlimited’s folding rear seat creates a spacious – and flat – load surface, the headrests don’t detach for folding, which necessitates moving the front seats as far forward as possible. Jeep’s interior design team should refer to Honda’s subcompact Fit for an idea of how to add ""convenience"" to ""functional."" 
Exterior StylingWith each generation, the Jeep Wrangler engineering team increases its footprint. And that was never more evident than in the 2007 redesign, when the two-door Wrangler grew and the four-door Wrangler Unlimited was first introduced. In its Unlimited form, the Wrangler SUV stretches almost 15 feet, weighing almost 4,500 pounds. That said, the 2012 Wrangler’s off-road intentions remain clear, with minimal overhangs front and rear. The exterior design retains a greenhouse that provides excellent visibility of both the trail and adjacent scenery. New for 2012 is a body-colored hardtop for both the two-door and four-door Wranglers (Sahara and Rubicon), creating a more unified – and upscale – appearance.
Favorite FeaturesNew 3.6-liter V6 PowertrainThe new 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 is the final piece in the Jeep Wrangler puzzle. And the improvement is more than just the raw power listed in the specs. In every on-and-off-road discipline, the newest Jeep is an improvement over its predecessor. And when equipped with the available 5-speed automatic, refinement goes up while losing very little – if any – capability or efficiency.
Stone-Axe SimplicityIn a world of disposable consumer goods, or those with life expectancy that goes just beyond their warranty period, the essential goodness of a Jeep Wrangler, including the 2012 Jeep Wrangler, exists within its basic simplicity. Body-on-frame construction may add weight, but it also ensures longevity and aids in ease of repair. Add in elements such as easily replaceable fenders and removable doors, and you have both an off-road tool and urban warrior.
Standard FeaturesWe’d (again) mention the 2012 Jeep Wrangler SUV’s 285 horsepower as most notable, but with additional power comes the need for enhanced control. Here, Jeep engineers have added a full menu of safety and security, including electronic stability control, electronic roll mitigation, Hill-start Assist, and Trailer-sway Control. Add the aggressive 4WD technology on the off-road-oriented Rubicon, and the most difficult trails become almost laughably easy. 
Factory OptionsThe 2012 Wrangler’s optional five-speed automatic transmission provides the driver with more efficiency, better access to the new V6’s torque curve and, with a lower 1st-gear ratio, better ability to crawl those rocks. And Jeep is one of the few manufacturers providing you a choice of rear-end ratios (3.21, 3.73 or 4.10). That choice allows the owner to truly tailor the Wrangler to his or her specific driving needs.
Engine & TransmissionThe 3.6-liter V6 in the 2012 Jeep Wrangler is truly a revelation. The new engine improves on the previous powerplant in both power (up by some 40 percent) and fuel efficiency (from 15/19 mpg (city/highway) in 2011 to as much as 17/21 in 2012). Featuring alloy construction, the 60-degree V6 is lighter and more compact than the 3.8-liter it replaces. And with 285 hp, the perceived need for a V8 is all but eliminated. With that, we continue to wish that Jeep would make available the diesel sold in many markets outside of the U.S. The diesel’s uptick in torque, along with an upsurge in fuel economy, would be all the new EPA regulations – and Jeep consumers – might ask for.

Read Full Review","What's New?The improvements found in the 2012 Jeep Wrangler can be summed up with one number: 285. That horsepower figure, from a new (for the Wrangler SUV) 3.6-liter V6, constitutes a 40-percent improvement as compared to its 202-horsepower predecessor. And when connected to the Wrangler’s new five-speed automatic (a six-speed manual transmission is the standard gearbox), the powertrain produces both better performance (zero-to-60 times are improved by two to three seconds) and fuel efficiency.
Iconic may be an overused descriptive, but the 2012 Jeep Wrangler SUV wears it well. Some 65 years after the end of World War II, civilians continue to embrace the same basic recipe of affordable four-wheel drive, despite the Jeep’s increased size, capability and – at a base price of"

The interior layout is simple, yet elegant. Navigating tight spots is an effortless task thanks to the Q5’s compact dimensions and relatively tight turning radius.","ConsWhile the 2012 Audi Q5 offers the best balance in the segment, you can easily find something sportier (BMW X3), softer (Lexus RX) or more affordable (Acura RDX) in the category.",36000,"Driving the Used 2012 Audi Q5A satisfying balance of ride comfort and dynamic handling has traditionally required compromises on both sides of the equation, but technology continues to rewrite the rules. While the BMW X3 and Lexus RX 350 hold down the segment’s extreme positions on the sport-comfort spectrum, respectively, the 2012 Audi Q5 offers a range of proficiency that approaches both ends. And that range is delivered by more than just the powertrain and suspension, but also by the outward visibility and ergonomics, and the ""driving sensation"" we consistently highlight when talking about European cars. The Q5 also adds a dose of customization to the driving experience when outfitted with its category-exclusive ""Audi drive select"" feature – highlighted in the Favorite Features section of this review.
Interior ComfortThe 2012 Audi Q5’s visually striking exterior is nearly eclipsed by its brilliant interior architecture. The layout is polished and classy, with precise construction and excellent fit and finish. The 12-way power front seats offer a host of configurations to accommodate an array of body types. The rear seats feature a versatile 40/20/40 split design and provide ample legroom and headroom. Audi is leading the way when it comes to innovative in-vehicle multimedia. The available feature-packed navigation system is controlled by Audi’s intuitive MMI terminal and includes 3D building graphics, DVD player and two SD card slots.
Exterior StylingAlthough the compact luxury SUV segment offers a variety of stylish choices, the 2012 Audi Q5 is the clear winner when it comes to innovative design. In line with Audi’s current design language, the Q5 features the distinctive Singleframe grille design, clean lines and of course, Audi’s infamous LED daytime running lights. The Audi Q5’s perfect height and large alloy wheels create a muscular stance once reserved for sports cars. We also like the Q5’s sedan-like LED taillights and unique ""clamshell"" power liftgate.
Favorite FeaturesAudi Drive Select At the push of a button, Q5 drivers can adjust the engine, transmission and steering characteristics to satisfy their personal preferences. Modes include Comfort, Automatic, Dynamic and Individual, which allows a custom-tailored setting on navigation-equipped models.
Audi Dynamic Steering In a tight parking lot, you want a lot of steering assist and response. When bombing down the autobahn, you want subtle directional changes and a calm steering response. With Audi dynamic steering, the 2012 Q5 has variable assist and variable ratio, delivering the best of both worlds. The system can even provide minor steering corrections in extreme situations, reducing the need for electronic stability program intervention.
Standard FeaturesEvery 2012 Audi Q5 features plush leather seating, power front seats with 4-way lumbar support for those extended road trips, 3-zone climate control, multi-function steering wheel to help keep your eyes on the road, and a 10-speaker audio system with SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Standard safety equipment includes six airbags along with electronic stability control that adjusts for a higher center of gravity when it detects the roof-rack crossbars are in place.
Factory OptionsFrom the base price of $36,475, the 2012 Audi Q5 offers around $17,000 worth of upgrades, highlights of which include xenon headlights with LED daytime running lights, a handy power liftgate with memory, panorama sunroof, Audi’s third-generation MMI interface and navigation system, front and rear proximity sensors, backup camera, blind spot warning, 505-watt Bang & Olufsen audio system and a heated and cooled single cup holder. It seems odd to us that despite the Q5’s mid-$30K base price, Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity, heated seats, auto-dimming mirrors and iPod integration are not offered as standard equipment.
Engine & TransmissionThe base Q5 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine shared with partner Volkswagen. Paired with a new 8-speed manually selectable Tiptronic automatic transmission, the 2.0T offers 6-cylinder performance with 4-cylinder fuel economy. Thanks to its turbocharged application, the 2.0T pumps out an additional fifteen lb-ft of torque compared to the available V6. The Q5 3.2 features a 3.2-liter V6 engine, all-wheel drive and a manually-selectable Tiptronic 6-speed. Despite the 4-cylinder’s superior torque figures, the 3.2-liter V6’s additional 59 horsepower helps rocket the Q5 to 60 miles per hour in 6.7 seconds (about a half second faster than the 2.0T) and to an electronically-limited top speed of 130 mph. Like most of Audi’s recent iterations of their quattro all-wheel-drive system, the Q5’s features a 40/60 rear-biased torque split, which improves performance driving feel versus a 50/50 distribution. In case your interests are more specialized, the 2012 Audi Q5 3.2 boasts a segment-leading 4,400-pound towing capacity combined with a 440-pound tongue weight rating.

And, despite Chevrolet’s value claims, for about the same price as the base LS trim, you can get into a nicely equipped Hyundai Sonata Limited.",26500,"Driving the Used 2012 Chevrolet ImpalaThe 2012 Impala gains greatly from its new 3.6-liter V6 engine. This 300-horsepower engine is velvety-smooth, silent and strong. The new 6-speed automatic transmission delivers seamless shifts and helps the 2012 Chevy Impala sedan to achieve an impressive 30-mpg highway figure. The Impala’s seating is supportive both front and rear, with wide bucket seats long on comfort but short on side bolstering. Engine and road noise have been minimized considerably, which may explain why wind noise seemed so noticeable. Regardless of trim, the Impala delivers a soft, comfortable ride ideal for straight, smooth pavement, but sporty handling is not its strong suit. However, if you do plan to do a bit of aggressive driving now and again, the top-level Impala LTZ offers a more solid feel and better handling, thanks to its 18-inch wheel-and-tire package. 
Interior ComfortThe 2012 Chevrolet Impala sedan’s interior is highlighted by simple instruments with large, easy-to-read numerals and lettering. Large rotary knobs for the radio and ventilation are also a nice change from smallish, hard-to-decipher buttons, and it’s easy to find a place to store small items thanks to the numerous cup holders and storage areas throughout the car. The 2012 Chevrolet Impala sedan is one of the last cars to offer an available front bench seat, although most trims will likely go out the door with a comfortable set of bucket seats separated by a wide console. The Impala’s available flip-and-fold rear seat increases an already massive trunk capacity, as well as provides an additional storage bin hidden beneath the seat bottom.
Exterior StylingConservative yet stylish, the 2012 Chevrolet Impala’s look is punctuated by a new grille (silver on LS and LT, black on LTZ) flanked by a pair of highly stylized rearward swept headlights. The Impala’s clean linear lines give the look and feel of a sedate luxury sedan, while the sporty LTZ trim stands out with its 18-inch split-spoke wheels and front foglights. We like that the 2012 Chevy Impala sedan’s roofline remains high as it moves rearward, a design that improves rear-seat headroom. The Impala’s trunk lid opens straight up to allow for easy loading and the low lift-over height aids when loading heavy or large items.
Favorite FeaturesBose AudioA feature usually not found in basic family sedans, the 8-speaker Bose audio system, available on the LT and standard on the LTZ, is a definite must for music lovers.

Engine & TransmissionThe Impala sedan’s sole powertrain consists of a 3.6-liter DOHC engine with variable valve timing and E85 compatibility. This is the same excellent GM V6 used in Buick and Cadillac sedans, and it serves the Impala equally well. The new 6-speed automatic is one of GM’s best and provides smooth shifts as well as the ability to avoid hunting for the right gear when climbing hills.

The 2012 Chevrolet Impala sedan is the last of a dying breed. The nearest thing Chevrolet has to a full-size sedan, the 2012 Impala retains the classic American full-size attributes of a big, roomy cabin, an equally big trunk, and a soft, comfortable ride. Of course, there is a host of newer sedans with more modern interiors, suspensions and powertrains including the Kia Optima, Dodge Charger and Ford Taurus just name a few. Yet, many of these cars also feature high-tech gadgetry and a firmer ride some buyers are just not interested in. With the 2012 Chevy Impala sedan, you get a powerful, safe and reliable sedan with simple and straightforward functions for the radio, heating and A/C.

Those looking for a light, nimble rear-drive sport coupe might be happier in a BMW 3 Series or Infiniti G37 Coupe.",26000,"Driving the Used 2012 Dodge ChallengerEven the most basic 2012 Dodge Challenger SXT coupe comes with a 305-horsepower V6 engine that provides plenty of get-up-and-go. But, if you really want to experience what the 2012 Dodge Challenger is all about, you must slip behind the wheel of a HEMI-powered R/T. Unlike its 1970s’ namesake, the current Challenger is a pleasure to drive. The ride is firm, but not jarring, although things do get a bit more rigid with the upgraded 20-inch wheels and sport suspension packages. In R/T form, the Challenger’s 5.7-liter V8 has plenty of muscle for fast off-the-line starts and terrifyingly quick passing maneuvers. While some of our testers found the 2012 Dodge Challenger’s steering to be on the heavy side, no one complained of losing confidence when executing high-speed maneuvers. The 2012 Dodge Challenger R/T’s suspension is sufficiently tight to control excessive body roll but, if all-out handling and gut-punching acceleration take precedence over a comfortable ride and reasonable fuel economy, the SRT8 392 trim is the obvious choice.
Interior ComfortAlthough functional and possessing a few cool styling features, the overall interior of the 2012 Dodge Challenger doesn’t live up to the promises made by its flashy exterior. Still a product of the previous-generation Charger, the Challenger’s interior has not received the opulent update of its 4-door big brother, so the hard plastics, dull colors and somewhat loud interior remain in place for 2012. The 2012 Dodge Challenger’s front bucket seats are wide and firm, with good side bolstering and adjustable lumbar support (something you won’t find on the Camaro) so crucial on long drives. And, unlike the Mustang or Camaro, the 2012 Dodge Challenger’s rear seats can actually fit two full-size adults (three in a pinch). A sizable trunk also gives the Challenger a leg-up on its Mustang and Camaro rivals.
Exterior StylingWhile some people see the 2012 Dodge Challenger sport coupe as a rehashed version of the original 1970s muscle car, we see it differently. The two cars may share similar visual cues, but the 2012 Dodge Challenger is much bigger, much wider and has a number of styling characteristics all its own. Bold exterior colors are designed to make the Challenger stand out even more than its attractive styling already does, and available accessories such as a hood scoop and rear spoiler, allow for individual customization of the car. Based on the Dodge Charger platform, the Challenger provides sedan-like comfort hidden inside a cool coupe shell. Our only regret is that Dodge couldn’t engineer the rear quarter windows to retract, a feature that would make the 2012 Dodge Challenger a true 2-door hardtop.
Favorite Features6.4-liter HEMI V8It’s the HEMI that brings the Challenger legend to life and with 470 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque, the 6.4-liter monster motor in the SRT8 392 ensures only a handful of cars will be able to keep up.
18-speaker Harman/Kardon audioThis 900-watt powerhouse uses the latest energy-efficient technology to produce amazing sound with minimal power draw.
Standard FeaturesThe 2012 Dodge Challenger SXT includes the 3.6-liter V6 engine that makes 305 horsepower, a 5-speed automatic transmission, automatic air conditioning, 18-inch aluminum wheels, cruise control, 6-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar adjustment, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, leather-wrapped shift knob, vehicle information center and an AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio system with auxiliary audio input jack. Depending upon the trim level, additional features include the 5.7-liter HEMI V8, a 6-speed manual transmission, limited-slip differential, foglights, security alarm, Sirius Satellite Radio, USB port, auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather seating, Boston Acoustics speakers, 276-watt amplifier, Uconnect Voice Command with Bluetooth, heated front seats and a variety of trim and convenience features. The SRT8 392 includes premium leather with accent stripes, 20-inch wheels with performance tires, a functional hood scoop, rear spoiler, performance-tuned steering, Brembo brakes front and rear, specific trim features and the SRT Track Experience, where new owners can go to learn how to better control the car’s incredible performance. 
Factory OptionsAvailable options for the V6 model include the SXT Plus package that adds leather seating, heated front seats, foglights, automatic headlights, Bluetooth streaming audio and phone connectivity with UConnect voice command, and a 276-watt Boston Acoustics audio system. Stand-alone options include updated audio systems, navigation and a number of dealer-installed accessories. R/T trims can be equipped with the Track Pack that includes 20-inch wheels and performance tires, heavy-duty brakes, performance steering and a track-tuned suspension. There are a variety of options for the SRT8 392, which are appropriate for its very high-performance mission in life.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2012 Dodge Challenger coupe offers a choice of three engines. Chrysler’s modern 3.6-liter V6 makes 305 horsepower and delivers plenty of performance for any reasonable use on the highway or a curving mountain road. The value leader is to be found with the 5.7-liter HEMI; with the 5-speed automatic it’s rated at 372 horsepower and with the 6-speed manual it’s at 376 horsepower. At the top end resides the SRT8 392 of 6.4 liters. Producing a whopping 470 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque, the only drawback to owning this powerplant is the cost incurred at the pump and possibly the courthouse.

The SRT8 392 trim gains a new 2-mode adjustable suspension-damping system and an available heated steering wheel.
The 2012 Dodge Challenger coupe continues to play in a 3-car rivalry with the Ford Mustang and the Chevrolet Camaro. While it remains true that the Challenger’s V6 and V8 engines fall short of the horsepower benchmarks set by Ford and Chevy, the differences are not insurmountable. There is still plenty of performance to be had from the 2012 Dodge Challenger coupe, especially in the potent SRT trim. With comparable pricing and features for each corresponding trim, you might be wondering why you’d choose a less powerful Challenger model over a Mustang or Camaro. Comfort is a big reason, as is everyday drivability. Where the Mustang and Camaro offer practically no rear-seat room and a tiny trunk, the larger 2012 Dodge Challenger coupe provides ample space for four people and their luggage. The Challenger’s interior is also much less claustrophobic than that of the Chevrolet Camaro, although its interior plastics are not quite up to the standard set by the Ford Mustang.

Compared to a Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander, the 2012 Dodge Journey does not hold its resale value nearly as well.",20000,"Driving the Used 2012 Dodge JourneyThe 2012 Dodge Journey crossover might look like a tall SUV, but its ride and handling characteristics remind us more of driving the Dodge Avenger sedan. Careful attention to the 2012 Dodge Journey’s suspension and steering calibrations give it a nice balance between agile cornering ability and comfortable, quiet ride. We were surprised how rapidly the Journey responded to steering inputs, and even when pushed hard into sharp turns the Journey exhibited only minor body roll and lean. With all three rows occupied, we discovered our front-seat and second-row passengers had nothing but praise for their accommodations. The third-row occupants, however, were not as kind. It was the general consensus that the Journey’s third-row seat is best reserved for small children. The 2012 Dodge Journey’s standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine doesn’t have to strain to move a lightly loaded Journey, but for overall performance and peace of mind, we’d recommend going with the Pentastar V6. The 3.6-liter Pentastar is one of the best V6 engines ever produced by Dodge, and may even rank as one of the best V6 engines of all time. From its abundant power to its excellent fuel economy, we found the 3.6 liter to be a real gem.
Interior ComfortIf you’re all about good design and a handsome, smart interior, we think you’ll like what Dodge has done with the 2012 Journey SUV. Of the five trims, the SXT and Crew are the most flexible, with various interior color choices in rich fabrics or plush leather. Soft-touch surfaces and material cover just about any spot where you’d want to rest an arm or hand, and the properly sized 3-spoke steering wheel is fitted with redundant controls for the audio and cruise control. R/T and Crew models feature an advanced 8.4-inch touch-screen audio system featuring the Uconnect suite of communication and connectivity options. Highlights include voice-activated controls for the Bluetooth, navigation, audio and iPod, as well as ""Eco-Route"" guidance and song tagging. There’s even a subscription option to Sirius Travel Link, which can provide updates for traffic, find the cheapest gasoline prices, plus report on sports scores, weather conditions and even movie times. On the versatility front, the 2012 Dodge Journey midsize SUV features a flush-folding third-row seat and second-row seats that can slide fore and aft (making access to the third-row seat a bit easier). Upper-level trims also have a flat-folding front seat that increases the cargo floor right up to the dashboard.
Exterior StylingAs midsize SUVs go, the 2012 Dodge Journey is on the larger side of the scale. Its tall stance and long profile give the Journey the look of a big wagon, similar to the old Chrysler Pacifica. The 2012 Dodge Journey SUV is so long, in fact, that it dwarfs the Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape by nearly 10 inches. To keep the exterior from looking too family-wagonish, Dodge has dressed up the Journey with a chrome-trimmed cross-hair grille, flashy alloy wheel choices and, on V6 models, a more aggressive lower air intake. The R/T trim takes things up another notch with a monochromatic exterior, 19-inch wheels, and R/T badging.
Favorite FeaturesFlip ‘n Stow StorageThe 2012 Dodge Journey’s front passenger-seat cushion flips forward to expose a big storage bin that can hide valuables from prying eyes, or just keep things in place.
In-Floor Storage BinsBehind the front seats are two bins in the floor that can accommodate up to a dozen 12-ounce cans and ice – or whatever else you can put in there. The bins have locking lids and are removable for easy cleaning.
Standard FeaturesA 2012 Dodge Journey AVP comes with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and 4-speed automatic transmission, power heated side mirrors, three 12-volt outlets, a 4.3-inch touch-screen AM/FM radio with a single-CD player, an audio input jack and USB port, keyless entry and push-button start, second-row in-floor storage, and a rear-cargo area covered storage bin. All models feature electronic traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes (ABS), front-seat side airbags, and 3-row side-curtain airbags.
Factory OptionsBeyond the base 2012 Dodge Journey AVP, there are four other Dodge Journey trims: SE, SXT, Crew and R/T. The SXT, Crew, and R/T have a 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. Options vary by trim and include all-wheel drive, UConnect Hands-free Communication network, leather seating surfaces, ParkView rearview camera, ParkSense parking assist, navigation, power moonroof, six premium speakers with subwoofer and 368-watt amplifier, third-row seating, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, 17- and 19-inch wheels, 3-zone automatic air conditioning, Tilt ‘n Slide second-row seats, Flip ‘n Stow compartment, and heated front seats. 
Engine & TransmissionEngineered for commuting and good gasoline mileage, the 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine provides a sufficient amount of power for the weight of this crossover, but the potent 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, which pumps out 283 horsepower, is really the engine you’ll want. Coupled to a 6-speed automatic transmission, the 3.6 liter never fails to deliver power when asked, and once up to speed, requires only minimal fuel to keep the Journey cruising. The Journey’s V6 is also E85-compatible.

The new American Value Package (AVP) brings an entry-level price that makes the 2012 Dodge Journey SUV the most affordable 7-passenger midsize SUV in America. Later in the model year, the Crew and R/T will offer a rear-seat DVD entertainment package.
The 2012 Dodge Journey SUV fits comfortably between a full-size and compact SUV, giving it the room to hold up to seven passengers in a package that is not unruly to drive or park. Fresh from a complete overhaul last year, the 2012 Dodge Journey SUV offers families a roomy and versatile environment with cabin styling and features more commonly found in high-end luxury cars. Crew models, for example, offer a choice of colorful leather seat trim, UConnect touch-screen radio with available Garmin navigation and keyless entry and start. But perhaps the best thing about the 2012 Dodge Journey is its available V6 engine, which is not only one of the most powerful engines in its class, but also one of the most fuel-efficient.

And if you’re looking for a family 4-door that stands out visually on the road, the sharp-looking Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima will draw more attention. 
What's New?The Volkswagen Passat sedan is not only larger, better equipped and much lower in price for 2012. It’s also tailor-made just for North America, in North America. 
If we were to describe the new 2012 Volkswagen Passat sedan in as few words as possible, we’d go with ""more for your money."" Compared to the previous-generation Passat , this all-new, just-for-North-America sedan is bigger, costs a lot less, and comes with more stuff standard. In other words, it’s the automotive equivalent of the extra-value meal at your local fast food joint. But rest assured, the refined on-road German manners that appealed to many buyers in the midsize-sedan market over the years haven’t been removed from this Passat iteration. If you’re looking for a practical family sedan that is also fun to drive, the new VW Passat is a worthy contender for your hard-earned dollar. 
Used 2012 Volkswagen Passat PricingA base 2012 Volkswagen Passat S with a manual transmission stickers in at a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $21,000. If rowing your own gears isn’t for you, moving to the 6-speed automatic transmission will require you to add the Appearance Package (front-illuminated vanity mirrors, unique wheels and a rear center armrest), and will bring the price closer to $23,500. Choosing the TDI diesel Passat nets you a starting price closer to $26,500, while the V6 with DSG dual-clutch automatic transmission brings the total closer to $29,500. A fully loaded VW Passat V6 SEL Premium will cost you about $33,500 when all is said and done. The Passat competes in the crowded midsize segment, which includes heavyweights like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Chevy Malibu and redesigned value-oriented rides like the Kia Optima and Hyundai Sonata. In this group, the Passat falls behind the Camry and Accord when it comes to resale value, but bests the Malibu, Optima and Sonata over time. 
Driving the Used 2012 Volkswagen PassatThe 2012 Volkswagen Passat sedan has grown substantially to appeal to North American sensibilities, but even though it’s now a larger car, the new Passat is lighter and delivers a refined road-going experience. Its new suspension – including a 4-link independent rear setup – cancels out most road imperfections, and body roll is nicely controlled on tight curvy roads. The 2.5-liter 5-cylinder will undoubtedly be the volume leader of the Passat’s engines and is a perfectly fine around-town commuter, but if you want more zip in your drive, the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder diesel engine is where you’ll get your smiles. Its minimal turbo lag and plenty of low-end torque make a trip of any length a more pleasurable experience. The final feather in the VW Passat’s cap: Whether you choose the 2.5-liter in-line 5, the TDI or the V6, this German sedan is one quiet ride. That’s a good thing, because with segment-leading rear legroom, passengers sitting there won’t need to yell to be heard. 
Interior ComfortThe 2012 VW Passat isn’t flashy inside. Think clean lines and tasteful – but not overdone – chrome. Lower-end Passats can look vanilla, but spending a little more and moving up to the Premium level adds Autumn Nut Burl wood trim detail that brings some visual interest to the cabin. Base S models come with standard cloth seating surfaces, while SE models get V-Tex leatherette and SEL models receive the full leather treatment with suede-like ""Dinamica"" inserts. And while we’re on the topic of seats, thanks to its longer wheelbase, rear seat passengers now enjoy 39.1 inches of legroom – which is more than any other current midsize sedan, and more than the longer and wider ""4-door coupe"" VW CC. 
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Volkswagen Passat may not be as distinctive-looking as the Passats that came before it, but its new looks should serve it well over time. It’s now sleeker and more angular in appearance, sporting a 3-bar horizontal grille and pronounced side crease lines that draw attention to the sedan’s increased length. This length also allows for a more sizeable trunk – with 15.9 cubic-feet of space, it’s a nearly a cubic foot larger than the trunk in the Honda Accord, which the EPA classifies as a large car. Sadly, the VW Passat Wagon is no more, so if you’re looking for a family-friendly front-wheel-drive hatchback, consider a VW Jetta SportWagen, Audi A3, Acura TSX Wagon or Honda Crosstour.

Hoping for a USB port to plug your mobile device into? You’ll have to move out of the base Passat to get it. 
Factory OptionsWith a lot of available options, it’s easy to spend more on a 2012 VW Passat. Worth noting: Vegan-friendly V-Tex leatherette seating, a Fender Premium audio system, an iPod interface and a quick-shifting 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. For a little more oomph in your daily drive, a 3.6-liter V6 or 2.0-liter 4-cylinder clean diesel engine are also on the menu.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2012 VW Passat sedan offers three engine choices: A 2.5-liter in-line-5 shared with the smaller Jetta, a turbocharged 2.0-liter in-line-4 diesel with direct injection (TDI), and a 3.6-liter V6. There are also four transmissions available: a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission direct shift gearbox (DSG). If how much you spend at the pump is important to you, you’ll be interested to know that the TDI can return a class-leading 43 mpg on the highway when matched with the manual transmission. In order to get comparable fuel economy with any other internal-combustion-engine-motivated sedan, you’d have to move down from the midsize segment.

As one would expect from a German-engineered car, the Jetta SportWagen is a great driver’s car. The firm suspension keeps body roll to a minimum without impinging on a smooth ride, even over rough or broken pavement. The 2.5-liter engine doesn’t deliver thrilling acceleration, but it gets the job done and returns respectable fuel economy. If you can afford the extra cash, go for the 2.0-liter TDI clean diesel. It has gobs of torque giving it GTI-like off-the-line acceleration, and it gets great fuel economy, with a projected highway range of over 600 miles on a single fill-up. Another advantage unique to the diesel Jetta SportWagen is its excellent DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) automatic transmission. The 6-speed DSG requires only a tapping of the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifter to deliver rapid-fire gear changes.
Interior ComfortWe’ve always been a fan of VW’s interior styling, and the 2012 Jetta SportWagen is no exception. Smartly styled with high-quality materials and brightly lit instrumentation, the SportWagen’s roomy interior feels almost Audi-like. A vast cargo hold behind the second row should please those who carry lots of gear or have large dogs. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the rear-seat accommodations, which are a bit snug in the legroom department. The 2012 VW Jetta SportWagen’s vast panoramic glass sunroof covers both front and rear seats, allowing everyone inside to enjoy sunshine and fresh air. Sadly, many of VW’s the best features, such as the Dynaudio stereo, power driver’s seat adjuster and leather seating, are not offered on the 2012 Jetta SportWagen.
Exterior StylingAlthough it shares a nameplate with the Jetta sedan, the 2012 VW Jetta SportWagen still rides on the previous-generation Jetta platform. Its sloping hood, swept back headlamps and 2-bar grille are shared with the current Golf/GTI, but the similarities stop there. The SportWagen’s extended roof allows for much more cargo storage aided by the factory roof rack. A wide rear liftgate allows full access to the roomy cargo area and is fitted with a rear defroster, wiper and washer. Available 17- inch alloy wheels help wake up an otherwise modest wagon design, as do the optional ground effects and 18-inch black alloy wheels.
Favorite Features2.0-LITER TDI DIESEL ENGINEThe Jetta’s 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine promises to be the star of the SportWagen engine lineup. Impressive torque output suggests the TDI is quicker than the 2.5-liter gasoline engine in some instances, and VW reports drivers may see better real-world mileage than the EPA-reported figures of 30 mpg city and 42 mpg highway.

The SE trim adds 16-inch alloy wheels, V-Tex leatherette seating surfaces, a 10-speaker Premium touch screen audio with 6-disc CD changer, MDI (Media Device Interface) iPod adapter, HD radio capability, and satellite radio with limited complimentary service. To this the TDI adds a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine, 6-speed manual transmission, 115-volt rear outlet and a multifunction steering wheel with audio controls.

Engine & TransmissionThe 2012 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen’s two engine options provide the car with two distinct personalities. The 2.5-liter 5-cylinder models are peppy, but not what we’d call scintillating performers. The 2.5-liter is clearly geared more toward a lower price point, good fuel economy and adequate power. The 2.0-liter TDI diesel, on the other hand, may be the best choice for the 2012 Jetta SportWagen, promising good acceleration and terrific fuel economy at a reasonable price.

If you’re not trying to squeeze every drop of gasoline from your tank, the 264-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 delivers a much more robust performance. V6-powered models also offer more optional equipment, such as the Lane Departure Warning and Forward Collision Alert systems. Finding a comfortable position behind the wheel is a breeze thanks to the tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and power adjustable seat. The Equinox’s sliding rear seats make it easy for rear-seat passengers to get comfortable, especially those with long legs.
Interior ComfortWhile the interiors of the Hyundai Santa Fe and Honda CR-V may be newer than the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV, we still think the Equinox has one of the most visually dynamic instrument panels and interior layouts in the segment. Aside from some plastics that look a bit cheap, the stunning flow of the center stack and the Equinox’s ice-blue ambient lighting and available perforated leather seats make you forget you’re not in a luxury crossover. Order the 2-tone Jet Black/Brownstone leather seat package, and you’d swear you were driving in a new small Cadillac crossover rather than in a Chevy. Beyond its good looks, the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox provides excellent room for four adults, a vast cargo hold and lots of clever storage spots for drinks, cell phones and odd and ends. The rear seats can slide forward a full eight inches, creating an even larger cargo area. To help keep the cabin quiet, 4-cylinder models are equipped with active noise cancellation, a system that employs the audio speakers to cancel out intrusive sound waves with counteracting sound waves.
Exterior StylingUnlike so many smaller crossover SUVs that attempt to mimic the styling of their full-size big brothers, Chevrolet wisely gave the 2012 Equinox SUV its own distinctive look. Looking more like a slightly overgrown Malibu wagon than a tough little SUV, the Chevy Equinox stands out with an oversized headlight treatment and the signature 2-bar grille. Eye-catching styling cues include the ""floating"" foglight bezels and the sharply creased fender flares that give the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV a decidedly racy appearance. While we find even the base trim to be attractive, it’s the LTZ trim that makes our hearts race. With its 19-inch aluminum alloy wheels, chrome-covered door handles and neatly placed roof rack, the LTZ really stands out from its competitors’ more pedestrian offerings.
Favorite FeaturesHeight-adjustable TailgateIf you have low garage clearance or limited vertical reach, the 2012 Chevy Equinox SUV allows the tailgate to be programmed to open to a safe or reachable height.
Rear-seat EntertainmentThis is an option we think more vehicles in the class should offer. In the 2012 Chevy Equinox compact SUV, the system features two independent seatback-mounted screens on which one rear passenger can watch a DVD movie while the other plays a (self-supplied) video game, for instance.
Standard FeaturesAll models have a 6-speed automatic transmission, while an ""eco"" mode on models with the 4-cylinder engine alters shift points to improve fuel economy. Safety and convenience are enhanced with standard OnStar, while XM Satellite Radio provides added entertainment value. The ""smart"" remote-start feature, standard on the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox 2LT and Equinox LTZ trims, also activates the heating and air conditioning.
Factory OptionsThe 2012 Chevy Equinox SUV offers a rear-seat DVD entertainment system and a power liftgate, both of which are uncommon in the category. Other notable options include the 264-horsepower V6 engine, all-wheel drive, a navigation system, comprehensive premium audio system, remote start, rearview camera, leather seating, heated front seats, and a memory-enabled driver’s seat and mirror. Later in the model year, Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system will allow users to connect their cell phones to the system, accessing such apps as Pandora and Stitcher Smart Radio via voice-activated commands.
Engine & TransmissionEvery 2012 Chevrolet Equinox compact SUV includes a fuel-efficient, 182-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine as standard equipment, and all but the entry LS trim level offer the upgrade to the 264-horsepower V6 for around $1,500. The engines feature direct-injection technology and are matched with 6-speed automatic transmissions, both of which simultaneously increase power and efficiency. The 4-cylinder versions offer an ""Eco"" button that sets the engine and transmission programming to mileage-maxing mode. Both engines are E85 compatible. The V6 offers manual shift control, although we felt it could be more responsive. The 4- and 6-cylinder versions feature tow ratings of 1,500 and 3,500 pounds respectively.

A rearview camera is added to the 1LT trim and a new 7-inch color touch-screen radio with USB port is made standard on 1LT, 2LT and LTZ. Later in the model year, Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment and safety system becomes available.
In the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox compact SUV, Chevrolet stretched the boundary of what is considered ""compact"" to create a small SUV priced and equipped like the segment-leading Honda CR-V, but with more power, more features and more style. Comparatively, the Toyota RAV4 might be a better matchup, as both vehicles have the same larger footprint, offer the option of a V6 engine and are similarly priced. Although unlike the RAV4, the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox SUV does not offer a third-row seat, it does have plenty of room for five and a sizable cargo hold to boot. The Traverse is more stylish than many of its competitors, including the conservatively styled Kia Sorrento and somewhat dated Ford Escape. With some of the best fuel-economy figures in the segment, the 2012 Chevy Equinox continues to draw customers-new and repeat alike-making the most of every penny they spend.

What's New?For 2012, the Sonata Limited gains a 3-piece panoramic sunroof, while all trims receive Hyundai’s Blue Link infotainment and safety system. Cars equipped with navigation also come with HD Radio.
If ever there was a car that proved that if you build it well, they will come (and buy it), it’s the 2012 Hyundai Sonata. The Sonata was once was just a low-priced midsize sedan with a great warranty, but the current Sonata has taken the market by storm. From its stunning sculpted exterior, to its modern and feature-filled interior, to a suite of powerful yet fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engines, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata hits every target with pin-point accuracy. Up against heavy hitters like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, the Sonata comes out smelling like rose, and a very inexpensive rose at that. Its engine uses the latest gasoline direct-injection technology to deliver some of the best fuel economy figures in the segment, and there is even a hybrid model to appeal to the super-green consumer who still needs the practicality of a big, roomy sedan.
Used 2012 Hyundai Sonata PricingA base 2012 Hyundai Sonata GLS sedan has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $20,500. The automatic transmission adds $1,000. Opting for the sportier, paddle shifter-equipped SE trim will bring the cost closer to $24,000, while the range-topping Limited 2.0T is around $27,000. Compared to most of its competitors in the midsize sedan segment, the Sonata falls on the lower side of the pricing spectrum, right in line with its ""value pricing"" philosophy. To make your best deal, be sure to check kbb.com’s Fair Purchase Price which gives an idea of what others in your area have paid. In terms of projected resale value, the Sonata has climbed its way into the top half of the class.
Driving the Used 2012 Hyundai SonataFor how quickly and smoothly the 2012 Hyundai Sonata pulls away from a stop, you’d swear there was a V6 engine under its sleek hood. But, what resides there is a 2.4-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and delivering fuel economy figures of 24 mpg city and 35 mpg highway. If that’s not enough power for you, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T sedan adds a turbocharger that brings output to a very healthy 274 horsepower. The Sonata excels in every category, with responsive power steering, excellent brakes and a suspension that delivers smoothness when the road get nasty and level cornering when the asphalt starts to curve. If there is a weak spot with the 2012 Hyundai Sonata sedan, it’s that interior noise levels are a bit higher than in competitors such as the Chevy Malibu and Honda Accord. From a comfort standpoint, our Limited trim’s seats were very comfortable, the dash and instrumentation were nice to look at and easy to figure out, and all but the tallest test drivers found the rear-seat headroom and legroom to be exceptional. 
Interior ComfortLike its dynamic exterior, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata midsize sedan’s interior is a work of art. Following the exterior design theme, the Sonata’s interior is a mix of bold shapes, smooth finishes and lots of attractive blue backlighting. The available two-tone interior package looks particularly inviting in black and wine leather, and features such as the Limited trim’s heated rear seat are practically unheard of in other competitors. However, while we do like the look of the rakish rear pillars, the design somewhat cuts into rear seat headroom.
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Hyundai Sonata sedan is truly an original that will be hard to top. From its deeply-sculpted hood to the careful use of chrome trim highlighting the beltline, there is something old-Detroit-classic about this car, a throwback to a time when designers took risks and weren’t afraid to produce something unique and dramatic. With its beautifully-detailed grille and swept-back headlamps, its high belt line and sharply-raked rear window, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata sedan projects a formidable presence few cars, let alone midsize family sedans, possess. The Sonata’s wheel and tire sizes vary by trim level and range from 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers to 19-inch split-spoke alloy wheels. One of the 2012 Hyundai Sonata’s more appealing exterior features is the Limited trim’s standard dual-panel moonroof.
Favorite FeaturesHeated rear seatsWhile some luxury-oriented sedans and SUVs offer heated rear seats, it isn’t something you generally see in an affordable midsize sedan. And the fact that they’re standard on the Limited trim makes them even more attractive.
HD RadioHD Radio doesn’t have the commercial-free appeal of Satellite Radio, but it sounds better and it’s free. We wish more automakers offered HD Radio, and we’re glad the 2011 Hyundai Sonata offers it on all trims. 
Standard FeaturesHyundai prides itself on offering vehicles chock-full of standard features, and the 2012 Hyundai Sonata sedan is no exception. The standard equipment list includes Hyundai’s new Blue Link infotainment and safety service, Bluetooth phone connectivity, iPod/USB music integration and steering wheel-mounted audio/cruise controls. An impressive array of standard safety equipment includes six airbags and electronic stability control. Like many of its competitors, the base-priced 2012 Hyundai Sonata is saddled with covered steel wheels and a 6-speed manual transmission.
Factory OptionsIn addition to common upgrades, including a moonroof and leather seats, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata midsize sedan extras list includes a touchscreen navigation system, backup camera, multiple premium audio systems and XM SatelliteRadio/traffic/weather. When ordered with the moonroof and navigation package, the SE trim can now be equipped with a rear backup camera.
Engine & TransmissionA turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and hybrid powertrain join the lineup for the 2012 model year, but the most popular engine choice for the 2012 Hyundai Sonata sedan remains the most powerful, most fuel-efficient 4-cylinder (non-turbo) in the category. The 2.4-liter engine with direct injection is mated to either a 6-speed manual (in GLS trim only) or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

With transportation the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of that combo would be under $34,000. Similar equipment on the 135i Coupe would bring the price to just below $42,000. For those wishing to take their BMWs with open air, the price rises faster than the tops will drop, with the 128i Convertible starting at around $38,000, and its more powerful 135i variant starting at under $45,000. If thinking to spend over $50K on a 1 Series Convertible you’d be well served to consider a CPO (Certified Pre-Owned) 1 Series or 3 Series drop-top as a more affordable alternative. Be sure and check kbb.com’s Fair Purchase Price for a clear idea of what consumers pay in your market area. And if you consider the cost of ownership and what you pay less what you receive at trade-in, you’ll be glad to know the 1 Series is among the top in its category for residual (retained value) performance.
Driving the Used 2012 BMW 1 SeriesWith reasonably light curb weight, an almost perfect 50:50 weight distribution and a choice of responsive powertrains, the 2012 1 Series Coupe and Convertible provide an entertaining envelope of spirited performance, dynamic handling and reasonable efficiency. As with most cars and SUVs in the BMW lineup, BMW’s smallest entry is well-connected to the road via its principal touch points: steering, braking and acceleration. Of course, the most exhilarating is the 135i Coupe, but an argument can be made for the better balance of the 128i. And if you live near a beach, or have access to scenic roadways, going slower with a top down is a viable alternative to tickets – or jail time.
Interior ComfortNissan once suggested that its Xterra SUV had ""everything you need, nothing you don’t."" Much the same descriptive could be applied to the 2012 1 Series Coupe and Convertible. These are interiors drawn for the motoring athlete, and while upgrades – notably leather and wood trim – are available, they remain largely irrelevant for those with an interest in the 1 Series as a driving instrument. For them, the available sport bucket seats and M Sport steering wheel are the only necessary or appropriate upgrades.
Exterior StylingMoving into the 2012 model year, this specific collection of compound curves is nearing the end of its production cycle, and while the simple, unadorned form doesn’t reek of planned obsolescence, neither is the sheet metal so fresh or original as to suggest ""classic."" The 1 Series’ architecture suggests a ""shrink-to-fit"" approach, but we appreciate a footprint that remains a tossable alternative to the ever-larger 3 Series.
Favorite FeaturesIn-line SixWhile we’re hard pressed to describe the 1 Series Coupe or Convertible as ""near-luxury,"" that seems to be where the market perceives them to be. And in that context an in-line six is still very unusual in the segment, and very premium in its operation. BMW’s TwinPower Turbo, of course, gets the big ink, but we’d be happy with either the 135’s turbo or 128’s normally aspirated. And with the 128’s base engine needing an additional second to get to 60, we’d leave one second earlier.
BMW Ultimate ServiceYou’ve written the big check (or financed the big number), and you simply want to sit back and enjoy the ownership process. BMW’s Ultimate Service makes that possible, covering ALL maintenance for the first four years and 50,000 miles of your ownership. From oil to brake pads to wiper blades, if it wears out or needs replacing, it’s covered. And it’s awesome!
Standard FeaturesMost notable – in a driver’s view – is an in-line six fitted to the 1 Series’ standard spec. Whether normally aspirated or turbocharged, the smoothness and flexibility of BMW’s iconic six will spoil you for other drivetrains, especially at the 128’s low-$30,000 price point. Beyond what’s under the hood, we’ll give a shout-out to what’s behind the driver – a rear seat available to close friends or family. With an almost perfect 50:50 distribution of mass, the fact that the 1 Series can accommodate four is utterly amazing. In tougher economic times the best economy car is one car capable of doing most things, and that summarizes a 1 Series perfectly.
Factory OptionsWere we building our own 2012 1 Series, we’d opt of one of two Sport packages. At a relatively low ($1,300) cost of entry is the base Sport package, providing a firmer suspension, staggered tire size, an increased top-speed limiter and sport buckets (with more aggressive bolster). The M Sport ($2,450) takes the above additions and supplements them with an aggressive aero kit and M Sport steering wheel. (Given the simplistic mechanical menu of the 1 Series Coupes, we’re inclined to leave ours cosmetically stock.) Of course, for those wanting to stay connected to both the road and the world around them, BMW Connected Drive affords you a host of technologies, all within the reach of a thumb.
Engine & TransmissionBMW’s in-line six is legendary, and has been a signature ingredient of small BMWs (in the U.S.) for some 25 years. For those finding the classic, normally aspirated recipe most desirable, the 128i synched to the standard 6-speed manual transmission is your well-developed answer (a 6-speed automatic is available as an option). And while its 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque may be duplicated by its eventual replacement, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four, the silky smoothness of an in-line six will never be replicated by anything other than an in-line six. In the next 135i, the six will probably be retained; as with most automakers, however, BMW’s drive to efficiency will eventually trump any further attempts at engineered nostalgia. The 2012 135i’s 3.0-liter in-line 6-cylinder engine transmits 300 horsepower through a 6-speed manual or optionally available 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2012 1 Series is given little more than minor tweaks. The most notable update in 2011 was under the hood of the 135i, when it received a more responsive version of the tried-and-true 3.0-liter in-line six. At the same time, the 135i received a 7-speed Double Clutch automatic transmission (optional), while the 128i continued with an optional 6-speed Steptronic automatic. The most significant change on the 2012 BMW 1 Series landscape is the discontinuation of the 1 Series M Coupe. Its limited production run is marked ""Sold.""
Good enough to even to make some 3 Series buyers think twice, the 2012 BMW 1 Series Coupe and Convertible remain relevant to any number of BMW enthusiasts, as well as younger buyers wanting an easier entrée into the joy of driving.

If you prefer the art of shopping to the art of driving you’ll find better options within BMW’s competitive set.",48000,"Driving the Used 2012 BMW X5With a sophisticated suspension, excellent braking, communicative steering and at least 300 horsepower, the 2012 BMW X5 – in any of its iterations – provides a compelling testament to BMW’s engineering prowess. No amount of engineering, however, can completely disguise the X5’s mass, some 5,000 pounds in basic x35i form. This remains a Sport Activity Vehicle and not, notably, a sport sedan; care should be given to operate an SUV in a more conservative manner than a sport sedan or Sports/GT. If you demand a combination of ""sport"" and ""utility,"" few will deliver that combo more credibly than BMW’s X5. 
Interior ComfortIn ""growing"" the brand, BMW expanded X5 cargo capacity via a longer and higher body in combination with a lower cargo floor. Rear seats fold flat, and an optional third row is available. That third row is best reserved for children; BMW’s target demographic for the X5 is young families. The cockpit is oriented to the driver, while a generous greenhouse provides excellent views out for both driver and passengers. Regrettably (given its starting price), leatherette is the standard seating material for both xDrive35i and xDrive35d. And a 2-piece tailgate provides access to the rear compartment.
Exterior StylingWith its exterior updates, last year’s X5 enjoyed the more organic feel of BMW’s sedan lineup. That, in combination with a longish wheelbase and short overhangs, imbues the new X5 with a visual athleticism not evident on the previous generation. Eighteen-inch wheels (standard) supply the X5 SUV with a planted stance, while both 19-inch and 20-inch are available to those wanting an even more aggressive look – and more aggressive on-road capability.
Favorite FeaturesxDrive35d DieselOffering 265 horsepower and a stump-pulling 425 lb-ft of torque, BMW’s Advanced Diesel is the perfect powerplant for the times. If going from stoplight to stoplight the diesel delivers a 0-60 time of under seven seconds. And if you’re going from coast to coast expect to eke out 26 mpg. The above, in combination with a genuinely fun demeanor, makes the xDrive35d SUV the gem in this particular lineup.
xDrive Full-Time All-Wheel Drive (AWD)With limited ground clearance and all-season tires, the 2012 X5 has few off-road aspirations, but it does have one of the best all-weather all-wheel-drive (AWD) systems available, which electronically varies front-to-rear torque and traction control to optimize grip.
Standard FeaturesAll X5 models enjoy a generous level of standard equipment. The base X5, with an MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) of roughly $48,500, includes xDrive all-wheel drive (no 2WD variants offered), Hill Descent Control, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, 3-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel, 10-way power-adjustable driver’s and passenger’s seat, iDrive system with on-board computer and controller and AM/FM stereo with 205 watts transmitted through 10 speakers. This, of course, is above and beyond the dynamic capabilities standard on every BMW. The X5 xDrive35d brings to the table 4-cylinder efficiency, prodigious torque and a third-row seat. Finally, both X5 xDrive50i and X5 M bring performance to blow your mind – along with everyone else’s. 
Factory OptionsThe base X5 is notable for the number of options not available. A Convenience package includes the panoramic moonroof, while navigation, heated front seats, a third-row seat and satellite radio can be spec’d separately. Opt for the X5 xDrive35i Premium, with a base of over $56,000, and your variables expand exponentially. An Active ventilated seat package, Cold Weather Package, Premium Sound Package and Convenience Package are just a few of the options you can include on your new X5.
Engine & TransmissionYou pay your money, and you take your choice. And as with most purchases, the decision is arrived at by balancing your needs and your wants. The great thing about BMW’s engine mix is that not one of them sacrifices performance; even the slowest off the line, BMW’s 3.0-liter turbodiesel, delivers 60 mph from a stop in under seven seconds. If you should want to stretch the envelope to its Chuck Yeager max, opt for the X5 M. This variant (of the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8) punches a full 555 horsepower to the pavement.

At the time of its introduction in late 1999, the BMW X5 SUV was either a revelation (for those new to the BMW brand) or an aberration (for those true to the BMW brand). Never before had BMW – or anyone else – combined an accomplished on-road dynamic with such a high degree of utility. Both substance and presence were upgraded in 2011, as the X5 received both new sheet metal and drivetrains. And those drivetrains run the gamut, from an in-line 6-cylinder delivering 300 horsepower to a twin-turbocharged V8 offering 400 horsepower, and the X5 M with 555 horsepower from the same 4.4-liter V8 displacement.

Driving the  2020 BMW M5The BMW M5 is one of these rare sedans that’s totally at home on a racetrack yet completely comfortable in everyday use. With all four wheels grappling for grip, this big German sedan accelerates with an uncanny composure, and it carves through corners far more decisively than any 2-ton midsize sedan rightfully should.
In standard all-wheel-/4-wheel-drive (AWD/4WD) mode, the M5 feels remarkably settled. In 4WD Sport, the system allows the M5 to slide around a bit more. In rear-wheel-/2-wheel-drive (RWD/2WD) mode, all power is sent to the rear wheels. This 2WD mode disables the traction control, which allows expert drivers to drift the M5’s tail.
When it’s not at the track, the 2020 BMW M5 drives like a potent 5 Series sedan. Whereas past M5s could feel a bit cantankerous around town, this one feels plush and serene when its driver-adjustable settings are tailored for comfort. If there’s anything the current M5 is missing, it’s this: a manual transmission.
Interior ComfortThe big change inside the BMW M5 for 2020? BMW now fits this potent sports sedan with Live Cockpit Professional, the name it applies to a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a large 10.25-inch central information display. What’s more, the M5 continues with iDrive, the multifunction controller that’s now in its seventh generation and can be operated by voice, button or a rotary controller on the center console.
Additionally, the 2020 BMW M5 has a head-up display, plus two USB ports and a wireless charger for a smartphone. Unfortunately, the CD player has been dropped from the M5 lineup.
As before, the M5 feels much like a standard 5 Series notched up in quality and performance, with two red buttons on the steering wheel that allow you to quickly select a driving setup already configured by you, the driver. Last, the M5 benefits from 32GB of multimedia storage, plus free OTA (over-the-air) map updates that can occur up to four times a year.
Exterior StylingOn the outside the M5 retains the basic exterior shape of its 5-Series siblings, but with specific M touches for better performance. The M5’s track and overall width are slightly wider than those of the standard 5 Series sedan, while overall height is a touch higher. The roof of this high-performance BMW 5 Series sedan is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic to cut weight, and it also possesses a unique front apron with enlarged air intakes and standard 19-inch wheels. Quad exhaust outlets are another indicator that it’s an M5.
Favorite FeaturesM XDRIVE ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE SYSTEM
In this arrangement, the M5’s front wheels are powered only when the rear wheels can’t transmit any more torque to the road. Even in BMW’s default settings, the stability control and 4WD allow a certain amount of slip at the rear wheels, preserving the M5’s traditional rear-drive feel.
M SPORT EXHAUST
This flap-controlled twin-pipe exhaust, standard on the M5 Competition, produces an especially distinctive exhaust note, especially at full throttle and high revs, with acoustics that change depending on the selected drive mode. We also like the black chrome finish on the tailpipes.
Standard FeaturesAs the top version of the BMW 5 Series lineup, the M5 is well equipped. In addition to all the performance upgrades and 19-inch alloy wheels, you’ll get 20-way-power front seats, Merino leather upholstery, fine wood trim, a head-up display, power-operated trunk, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and steering wheel, and a universal garage remote.
Safety features include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and frontal-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The M5 Competition, of note, comes with slightly lower sport suspension, a larger rear anti-roll bar and BMW’s M Sport exhaust.
Factory OptionsThe Driving Assist Plus package ($1,700) includes active cruise control (with Stop & Go), active lane-keeping assist and a front cross-traffic alert. The Executive Package ($3,650) ups the luxury quotient with 4-zone climate control, soft-close doors, massaging front seats, a 360-degree camera system and power sunshades for the back glass and rear side windows.
Two of the pricier options available on the 2020 BMW M5 include a 1,400-watt Bowers & Wilkins sound system with 16 speakers ($3,400) and long-lasting carbon-ceramic brakes ($8,500) that shave 42 pounds of rotating mass. Night Vision ($2,300) also is available. It uses a thermal-imaging camera in the nose of the M5 that “sees” people, animals and other objects up to 300 feet ahead, based upon their heat signature. Night Vision functions only at night, and only in air temperatures cooler than 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
Interestingly, the M Driver’s Package ($2,500) doesn’t bring a bounty of hardware to the table, but it does raise the electronically limited top speed of the M5 from 155 mph to 189 mph. More important, it includes a ticket to the one-day High Performance Driving Class at the BMW Performance Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina, or Thermal, California, where you’ll get to safely probe the limits of various M vehicles on the track.
Engine & TransmissionThe aluminum-block twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 in the 2020 BMW M5 makes a nice even 600 horsepower. In the M5 Competition, the same basic V8 makes 617 horsepower, thanks to tuning tweaks and a less restrictive M Sport exhaust. All-wheel drive keeps the M5 composed in hard acceleration, a thrilling experience accompanied by the crisp shifts of BMW’s excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. Although the M5 has a rear-wheel-drive setting, choose it with caution as this German sports sedan can smoke its rear tires at will.

Thanks to its 600-horsepower twin-turbo V8, the 2020 BMW M5 is an exceptionally fast sedan. Aided by a paddle-shifted 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive, this 6th-generation Bavarian super sedan puts the power down with remarkable composure as it streaks to 60 mph in a scant 3.2 seconds and reaches an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. The M5 Competition model builds on the performance of the standard M5 with aggressively tuned suspension, firmer engine mounts and a 617-horsepower V8.
Both M5s can be switched into a special rear-drive mode that allows burnouts and other tail-out shenanigans.
New for 2020 is the Edition 35 model. Based on the M5 Competition and limited to 35 models in the U.S., the Edition 35 M5 celebrates the 35th anniversary of the M5 with Frozen Dark Grey II paint, unique interior trim, the Executive Package, the M Driver’s Package and black brake calipers. 2020 BMW M5 PricingThe 2020 BMW M5 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of"

What's New?The 2012 Buick Enclave SUV drops the CX and CXL trim designations, leaving a single model with a number of option packages. New standard features include Hill-Hold Assist and an electronic brake override system designed to prevent unintended acceleration.
As more and more people move away from truck-based SUVs into smaller, more manageable crossovers, the 2012 Buick Enclave begins to make a lot of sense. Once known only for its near-luxury cars with an aging customer base, Buick has transformed itself into a manufacturer of modern luxury vehicles with a uniquely American take. In the 2012 Enclave SUV, Buick has created a vehicle specifically targeted at affluent younger buyers with growing families, people who ordinarily might purchase an Acura MDX, Audi Q7 or a Volvo XC90. The 2012 Enclave offers excellent value in terms of interior space, luxury amenities, styling and highway fuel economy. The 8-passenger Buick Enclave SUV also undercuts more expensive premium-luxury brands by thousands of dollars while still offering the status such premium-brand buyers demand.
Used 2012 Buick Enclave PricingAmong the 2012 Buick Enclave SUV’s competitors are the Lexus RX 350, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 and Acura MDX. With a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $37,500, the front-drive base Enclave is a real bargain. However, a fully loaded Premium Group model with AWD can approach $55,000. While the less-expensive Enclave doesn’t offer a V8 engine like the XC90 or a turbodiesel like the Q7, it does offer seating for eight, more than any of its competitors. To compare the actual transaction prices that consumers are paying, be sure to check the Enclave’s Fair Purchase Price on kbb.com. The price advantage offered by the Buick Enclave is somewhat offset by residual values that are expected to fall well below many of its competitors.
Driving the Used 2012 Buick EnclaveThe 2012 Buick Enclave can easily carry up to eight adults in relaxed comfort. The driving dynamics for the Enclave are not sports-car-like, but there is plenty of useful feedback via the steering wheel, and the cable chassis and suspension turn in an impressively stable performance. The Enclave’s V6 engine provides adequate acceleration, but it could do with a few more horsepower. On the flip side, the Enclave’s fuel-economy ratings are near the top of its class. At cruising speeds Buick’s attention to noise reduction pays off with very little wind, road or engine noise intruding into the cabin. The 2012 Buick Enclave is available in front-wheel drive (FWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) versions.
Interior ComfortThe 2012 Buick Enclave displays a lovely curving instrument panel equipped with highly stylized instrument faces and switchgear. Accented with camphor burled-wood inlays, the Enclave’s interior makes for a warm, inviting cabin, as does the intricate sew pattern in the available leather seating and the elegant analog clock. A copious amount of sound-deadening material creates a passenger space that is whisper-quiet at highway speeds, nearly devoid of wind or tire noise. Available with either 7- or 8-passenger seating, the 2012 Enclave SUV features slide-and-fold second-row seats that can be operated with one hand, clearing a wide path to the third-row seat. Perhaps one of the Enclave’s greatest strengths is the spacious cargo area behind the third-row seat, an attribute rarely found on the Enclave’s competition.
Exterior StylingDespite the design being a few years old now, the 2012 Buick Enclave still looks good. Maybe it’s because the SUV you see today mirrors to the last detail the Enclave concept that first debuted to rave reviews. Or, maybe it’s just good design. In any case, the 8-passenger Enclave is a head-turner, with such stunning styling features as an oversized waterfall grille, traditional Buick ""portholes"" above the front fenders and finely detailed headlight casing with swiveling projector beams. Further luxury enhancements include 18- and 19-inch chrome alloy wheels, chrome-trimmed roof rails and chrome exhaust tips.
Favorite FeaturesSecond-Row SeatsGetting to the rear-most seats in many vehicles can be a hassle. Not so in the 2012 Buick Enclave SUV, where the cleverly designed second-row seats, with flip-up cushions and the capability to slide far forward, provide a wide flat space to enter the third-row seating area. 
QuietTuning Buick’s QuietTuning method of in-vehicle noise reduction may seem like marketing hype, but it has to be experienced to be appreciated. At higher speeds the interior remains delightfully calm and free of the sounds that fatigue occupants on long drives.
Standard FeaturesThe 2012 Buick Enclave SUV comes in one trim with four possible packages. The base package includes 18-inch wheels, a power liftgate, power front seats and tri-zone automatic climate control. The Convenience Group adds Ultrasonic Rear Park Assist, rearview camera and remote start, while the Leather Group brings leather seating, heated front seats and a 4-way power passenger seat with power lumbar and recline. The Premium Group brings heated and cooling front seats. Standard safety features on the 2012 Buick Enclave include antilock brakes (ABS), stability and traction control, front airbags, front-seat-mounted airbags and 3-row side-curtain airbags that stay inflated longer in the event of a vehicle rollover.
Factory OptionsMany of the available features for the 2012 Enclave are packages within its various groups. The most comprehensive group is the Premium Group, which includes power-folding side mirrors, adaptive headlights, Bose audio, heated/cooled front seats and a power tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel. Other options include all-wheel drive (AWD), a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, a rear-facing camera, 8-passenger seating, Bose audio, a DVD navigation system and a power sunroof.
Engine & TransmissionPowering the 2012 Buick Enclave crossover SUV is a sturdy 3.6-liter V6. It delivers energetic performance and excellent fuel economy with the help of modern technologies like variable valve timing, direct injection and an electronic throttle. The V6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A wide spread of gear ratios helps get the most out of the engine while maximizing efficiency. We did, however, notice some delayed reactions from the transmission and the occasional rough shift. An optional all-wheel-drive system is also available that requires no driver intervention and automatically distributes torque between the front and rear wheels.

What's New?The 2012 Kia Forte sedan and hatchback see a 1-mpg improvement in city fuel economy and 2-mpg increase in their highway figures, boosting overall mileage to 26 city/36 highway when equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission.
While many critics complain that some Japanese car companies have been resting on their laurels a bit too long, the Korean manufacturer Kia has been working overtime to improve its product line. Reveal after reveal shows Kia now has the upper hand over Honda and Toyota, at least in the areas of innovation, styling and fuel economy. One such example is the 2012 Kia Forte compact car, a Civic-sized competitor with loads of cool features demanded by today’s young drivers, a versatile model range including a 5-door hatchback and sporty coupe, and a price point designed to give the competition fits. Designed to lure customers from such stalwarts as the Honda Civic, Ford Focus and Chevy Cruze, the 2012 Kia Forte has its share of pros and cons when placed beside each of these cars. Still not as fun to drive as a Mazda3 or VW Golf, nor as upscale in feel as the Focus or Cruze, the 2012 Kia Forte compact sedan and coupe (Kia spells it ""Koup"") nevertheless offer a lot of value for the money, not to mention the standard 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.
Used 2012 Kia Forte PricingThe 2012 Kia Forte sedan starts at a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) around $16,000 and tops out at about $25,000 fully loaded. The 5-door model ranges from just under $19,000 to $24,500, while the Koup starts at around $18,000 and goes to about $24,000. We expect our Fair Purchase Price to reflect real-world selling prices in line with those sticker prices. In a feature-based comparison, the 2012 Kia Forte sedan offers more for the money than many cars in the segment, including the Honda Civic and Mazda3. Substandard resale values have traditionally erased Kia’s up-front price advantages, but the Forte’s resale outlook is significantly better than that of the Kia Spectra it replaced, making Kia’s newest compact car its most compelling ever.
Driving the Used 2012 Kia ForteOn the open road, the 2012 Kia Forte is the master of its domain – so long as the road to that domain remains straight and level. Toss in a few curves, however, and the base car with its smaller engine and wheel/tire combo isn’t as much fun to drive as the more powerful EX and SX trims. Even in its most aggressive SX suit, the Forte won’t deliver the kind of seat-of-your-pants cornering found in the Ford Focus or Mazda3, and its manual transmission is nowhere near as refined. What’s missing is that harmonious connection between the steering, the transmission and pedal feel, something Kia is getting better at, but still has a way to go. To gain the impressive fuel-economy figures posted by both the LX and SX trims, Kia engineers have to give up a bit of low-end torque, something we would gladly switch around if given the chance. Don’t get us wrong, the Forte is not horribly slow nor devoid of feedback to the driver, it’s just that the sporty exterior had us hoping for a bit more performance. There is much to like here, and most drivers will appreciate the 2012 Kia Forte’s quiet cabin that permits very little wind, engine or road noise to make its way in. About the only real complaint we can find with the Forte’s cabin is the high rear deck that can make backing out of parking spaces a bit dicey. We suggest the optional navigation system with its rearview camera as a remedy.
Interior ComfortCustomers have been complaining for some time now about the boring interiors of compact cars, and Kia has obviously been listening. The 2012 Kia Forte sedan is given a visually appealing dash and seat setup, with lots of colorful instruments, a big LCD screen for the audio and plenty of soft-touch materials throughout the cabin. There is a lot going on inside the Kia Forte’s cabin, with multiple folds in the dash and numerous controls on the attractive 3-spoke steering wheel making the Forte feel more like a little Audi than an entry-level compact car. We applaud the standard Bluetooth connectivity and iPod integration, but feel as though a bit more attention could be paid to the seats, which lack support for the lower back and thighs. But, there is more than just interior decorating going on here, there’s also a volume story to tell. Despite its small size, the 2012 Kia Forte sedan (and to a lesser degree, the coupe model) provides a surprisingly large cabin, with more interior volume than a Nissan Maxima. The big back seat offers lots of legroom, but headroom is cut short due to the low-slung roofline. On sedan models, the trunk area is also quite large and on the 5-door hatch, the rear seats can be folded flat to create a wagon-like cargo hold.
Exterior StylingIn the herd of the compact sedan/coupe/hatchback, the 2012 Kia Forte’s styling falls somewhere mid-pack. Not as modern or aggressively styled as the Ford Focus or Mazda3, the Forte easily outshines the dated Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra, and even the new Honda Civic. Although the Forte Koup steals the show, the sedan and hatchback both share the signature Kia grille and headlight design as well as tout handsome wheel choices. Base model cars don’t look the part, rejecting the unpainted bumpers, mirror caps and door handles of lesser cars and replacing them with properly painted parts for a more harmonious exterior statement. High-end Forte trims include such nice touches as sport side mirrors with integrated turn signals, and an available body kit and rear spoiler.
Favorite FeaturesComprehensive Audio SystemEvery 2012 Kia Forte boasts a flexible AM/FM/CD/MP3/satellite audio system with USB and auxiliary ports. When matched with the upgraded speakers, it’s among the best sound systems in the segment.
BluetoothAn option reserved for most high-end models, Kia makes Bluetooth connectivity standard on every 2012 Kia Forte. Are you listening, Honda?
Standard FeaturesKia is proud to boast that even the most basic 2012 Kia Forte sedan includes Bluetooth phone connectivity, iPod integration, an AM/FM/CD/MP3/SiriusXM 4-speaker stereo, color-keyed manual side mirrors, 60/40-split rear seat with folding armrest, a tilt steering wheel, and an impressive array of safety equipment including six airbags, and electronic traction and stability control. Unfortunately, if you want such simple pleasures as power windows, remote keyless entry or cruise control, you’ll have to pony up a bit more cash and move up to the EX or SX trims. Here you’ll find a 6-speaker AM/FM/MP3/SiriusXM audio head unit, heated power side mirrors, and a tilt-telescopic steering wheel. Unique to the SX’s standard equipment list are 17-inch alloy wheels, a sport suspension, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and sport-fabric seats. The Koup (yes, that’s how Kia spells ""coupe"") models feature standard 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels. The LX trim comes standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, as do both the EX and EX Koup. All other Forte models and trims feature a 6-speed Sportronic automatic with manual-shift mode.
Factory OptionsOptions for the 2012 Kia Forte are limited to the EX and SX trims and include a number of packages as well as some stand-alone features. The 2012 Kia Forte EX sedan offers a Premium Package that adds alloy wheels and a power sunroof, as well as a Technology Package (sedan/hatchback/coupe) that includes navigation with Sirius real-time traffic updates, a rearview camera, automatic climate control, smart-key entry with push-button start, foglights and automatic headlights. The Forte SX offers the same package without the foglights and auto-on headlights, since both of these are already standard on the SX. Other options for the SX trim include leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.
Engine & TransmissionThe front-wheel-drive Kia Forte offers a 156-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that can be matched with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed Sportmatic automatic transmission. On top-line, sport-tuned SX trims the standard engine is a 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter engine. The 2012 Forte’s new automatic transmission has a manual-shift mode and is standard on SX and EX sedan and hatchback models, and available on the coupe. The mid-trim EX is also offered with a Fuel Economy Package that includes the 6-speed automatic plus Motor Drive Power Steering, a load-managing ""smart"" alternator, low-rolling-resistance tires and unique aero enhancements to boost its EPA numbers to 27/37 mpg and deliver class-leading city/highway combined fuel economy of 30 mpg.

Driving the  2021 Chevrolet Colorado Crew CabDriving the 2020 Chevrolet Colorado feels decidedly unlike what you’d expect from a truck.
Lacking the bouncy, road-vibrating feel you’d assume comes with a truck, the ride remains comfortable. There’s nothing harsh about the suspension on the highway. We really praise the steering in the Colorado. It’s got good weight, not too light.
The 2.8-liter Duramax diesel is a particularly good choice both for those hauling a trailer and for buyers looking for great mileage. The ZR2, meanwhile, offers a well-engineered alternative to the Toyota Tacoma, if you’re into off-roading.
Interior ComfortThe 2021 Chevrolet Colorado offers the same well-laid-out interior familiar from previous model years. Chevy doesn’t use a ton of premium interior fit-and-finish materials compared to some of the others in the segment, even on the upgraded trim levels. However, buyers do get a 7-inch touchscreen standard on the WT.
The 2021 LT sees an upgraded Infotainment 3 system and an 8-inch touchscreen display. The cabin has the rugged feel of a truck that can stand up to serious work. The seats are supportive, and there’s decent passenger room in the second row if you need it.
Exterior StylingThe 2021 Colorado exterior sees the most changes over the 2020 model, primarily to the front end. WT, LT, and Z71 models get updated lower facias, center bars, and skidplates.
The ZR2 gets a new front fascia that looks more aggressive than before. It retains its traditional body-on-frame bones and a classically rugged exterior design. With this redesign, the ZR2 especially catches up in the “mean-looking” department with the Toyota Tacoma. The exterior remains strong and tough-looking, but not overwrought. The ZR2 looks ready to go rock-crawling over the weekend and then take you to your office on Monday. The off-road edition features a raised suspension, a wider track, revised bumpers, and a functional skidplate.
Favorite FeaturesDURAMAX DIESEL
The 2021 Chevrolet Colorado remains the only midsize truck available with a diesel engine, and the 2.8-liter Duramax is a prize. Smooth and powerful, it offers a first-rate driving experience along with superior fuel economy. A smart diesel exhaust brake enhances control while reducing brake wear. This engine also provides best-in-class towing capacity of 7,700 pounds.
COLORADO ZR2
The 2021 Chevrolet Colorado continues to spoil truck buyers with the ZR2 off-road trim. For 2021, it’s fiercer looking and according to Chevrolet, offers improved visibility with its new grille’s design. It’s got serious off-road equipment, including Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and additional skidplates under valuable components.
Standard FeaturesEvery budget feels accounted for when it comes to the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado. The base Work Truck gets powered by a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with a 5,500-pound towing capacity on the rear-drive model. Even the base model offers some welcome features, such as the CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate, and cargo-box lighting, plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
The more mainstream LT trim adds an 8-inch touchscreen, as well as rear-park assist. The ZR2 off-roader adds tow hooks, an off-road suspension package, and skidplates.
Factory OptionsThere are two optional powertrain packages on the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado: a 3.6-liter V-6 and the boulder-dragging 2.8-liter inline-4 Duramax diesel. Chevy also offers a wide range of body styles. Those include a crew cab, as well as standard- and extended-length beds.
You can add features like a spray-in bedliner, fog lights, and cargo-bed storage rails, as well as 4-wheel drive (4WD) and a low-speed transfer case. The Z71 adds some off-road features, and the ZR2 takes you to rock-crawling extremes. To really lux out your truck, opt for 20-inch wheels, wireless charging, Wi-Fi hotspot, navigation, and Bluetooth audio streaming for up to two devices.
Engine & TransmissionThe Chevy Colorado offers a choice of three different engines, which for the midsize-truck category is rare. Those choices span a strong 2.5-liter four, a 308-horsepower 3.6-liter V6, and a formidable 2.8-liter turbodiesel-4. That last option not only offers the truck’s best towing numbers, but also delivers its best fuel economy, at up to 30 mpg in rear-wheel-drive (2WD) configuration.
Depending on the model, the 2020 Chevy Colorado comes in either 2WD or 4WD, and the Z71 and ZR2 models beef up off-road capabilities. A low-range gearbox also shows up on the options list.

The midsize-truck market teems with worthy contenders, but the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado checks off more boxes than most when it comes to truck form and function. Not only the best-looking in our opinion, the Colorado offers up the most options when it comes to powertrain choices. We’re so impressed with the Colorado’s capabilities, that Kelley Blue Book named it the midsize Pickup Truck Best Buy of 2020.
The diesel engine provides best-in-class towing capacity for the Chevy Bowtie. Buyers can also configure their truck in more ways than any other in the category, including the Ford Ranger, Jeep Gladiator, and Toyota Tacoma. Both the long and short beds can be had with crew-cab and extended-cab options.
For off-road antics, both the Z71 and ZR2 trims provide robust capability, and on the highway, the ride quality feels surprisingly un-trucky. The Colorado’s well-rounded resume makes it a tough opponent in a competitive segment.

In the Snowbelt Jeep’s three 4WD systems provide needed security through all four seasons, while the Grand Cherokee’s 2WD system and its rear-wheel-drive (RWD) architecture provide a balance of handling and traction not (typically) available in front-wheel-drive crossovers.","ConsTo create a platform with both on- and off-road capability, there are inevitably some compromises of interior room and accommodation. And while the Grand Cherokee’s wheelbase stretch for 2011 created significantly more room for rear-seat passengers, this remains a 2-row SUV, more tightly drawn than many car-based competitors in the same price category. In short, if ""room"" is more important than ""roam,"" there may be better choices available to you.",28,"Driving the Used 2012 Jeep Grand CherokeeAt its price point the new-for-2011 Grand Cherokee was one of the most capable on- and off-roaders available. The key is adaptation of an all-independent suspension for enhanced on-road composure and comfort, while not compromising its prowess when the pavement becomes unpaved. And for those with a real penchant for the ""road less traveled,"" Jeep’s available Quadra-Lift air suspension (4×4 only) impresses with its ability to clear large objects off-road, while hunkering down beneath the turbulent air at higher on-road speeds. Of course, while giving the chassis and suspension its appropriate due, we shouldn’t forget powertrains. The new V6 (2011) is a huge improvement over the previous 3.8-liter lump, the HEMI has recently gained improved efficiency with its fuel-saving, multi-displacement technology, and the SRT8’s 6.4 liter can give Porsche’s Cayenne a credible run for its money. Finally, the Grand Cherokee’s power-assisted steering feels better connected to the wheels, and the wheels – via careful attention to spring and shock rates – feel better connected to the road.
Interior ComfortIn its redesign of the Grand Cherokee for 2011, the Chrysler design team executed what can only be called a seismic shift in both design and material selection. In its previous generation (2006 through 2010) the Grand Cherokee was notable for hard plastics and, to a lesser extent, hard seating. Further, the rear seat was short on legroom and difficult to access. With a longer wheelbase the rear seat is made much more accessible, and once inside you’ll enjoy expanded use of soft materials, real wood trim (in upscale variants) and a much more concerted effort to make the driver and passenger experience everything you’d want in a luxury SUV. This is without – of course – the penalty of a luxury price. Today’s Grand Cherokee can now credibly play on a global stage, regardless of whether that stage is asphalt or rock.
Exterior StylingThere’s a unity to the new Grand Cherokee sheet metal that we haven’t seen since its initial launch two decades ago. To be sure, the familiar cues – 7-slot grille, hexagonal wheel arches and minimal front and rear overhangs – remain, but the whole now comprises various elements much better integrated than before. And visual upgrades in all trim levels, from base Laredo to Overland Summit, result in a 2012 Grand Cherokee family looking decidedly more upscale than previous generations. We especially like the wheel-and-tire fitments, in combination with shortened overhangs; even the Laredo’s standard 17-inch alloys fill the wheel wells in a capable, off-road-worthy fashion. 
Favorite FeaturesQuadra-Lift Air SuspensionAvailable on 4WD models only, the Quadra-Lift option allows Jeep enthusiasts to join the rarefied ""air"" of Land Rover and Range Rover customers with adjustable ride height fully compatible with virtually any road or off-road condition. What is described as ""normal ride height"" provides just over eight inches of clearance for improved fuel economy via enhanced aerodynamics. If you’re venturing off-road, you can adjust the clearance upward by 1.3 or 2.6 inches, while, if parked you can lower the vehicle 1.5 inches. The lower figure, of course, eases passenger loading and unloading. 
Overland Summit New Saddle leatherIn between tax hikes, the design team at Jeep has thrown a bone to the nation’s off-roading affluent with the best reason yet to opt for ""natural"" hide. The leather for the Overland Summit seemingly covers everything in the interior of this grandest Grand Cherokee except the windshield. While wishing they wouldn’t spell the model designation out on the seat itself, those popping for the top trim will be rewarded with each and every drive.
Standard FeaturesDespite a modest base price of around $28K (2WD), the 2012 Grand Cherokee comes with dual-zone A/C, rear liftgate ""flipper"" glass, remote key fobs, Jeep’s Media Center 130 AM/FM/CD radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel and 17-inch alloy wheels. Those placing a premium on active safety will enjoy standard ESC (electronic stability control), electronic roll mitigation and ABS. And interested consumers should note that in combination with a slight decrease in base window sticker (for 2012) comes a realignment of standard equipment and optional extras.
Factory OptionsFor those wanting to keep the MSRP low and the appearance of their new Grand Cherokee up(scale), the Laredo X should check most boxes, as it provides a number of enhancements – cosmetic and functional – not available on the base Laredo. And for those wanting to enhance the Jeep experience even further, a number of chassis improvements will do just that, beginning with Quadra-Drive II (includes 2-speed transfer case and Hill Descent Control), Quadra-Lift Air Suspension (adjustable ride height for both off-road adventure and on-road composure) and Selec-Terrain. Selec-Terrain is Jeep’s electronic take on all-season capability, allowing for five traction control settings: Automatic, Sport, Snow, Sand/Mud and Rock.
Engine & TransmissionWith the reintroduction of the Grand Cherokee SRT8, the Jeep customer can enjoy a veritable ""holy trinity"" of exciting powertrains. The standard 3.6 liter approaches V8-like horsepower and torque levels, while admitting that even when connected to the 2WD platform it has a great deal of mass to motivate. The 5.7-liter HEMI benefits from multi-displacement technology; based on need, the HEMI will operate on all eight cylinders or with reduced demand, only four. And with the increased displacement, horsepower and torque of the HEMI, owners can enjoy an enhanced towing capability (7,400 pounds versus 5,000 pounds in the V6). The SRT8’s 6.4 liters and 470 horsepower bring new life, and a nationwide network of dealers, to the hyper-performance SUV segment.

Read Full Review","What's New?Given the very big changes made in 2011, this is a year of tweaking a ""still new"" redesign. V6 models receive an electrohydraulic power steering system, while the V8’s automatic transmission now provides six speeds when shifted in manual mode. And the HEMI-equipped SRT8 is revived, with 6.4 liters and 470 horsepower of urge.
As Chrysler’s 2011 Rookie of the Year, Jeep’s 2012 Grand Cherokee enters its sophomore season with minor enhancements (improved fuel economy, revised automatic transmission for V8 models) added to what in 2011 was an all-new architecture. And this all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee did for the segment what many manufacturers have – with their redesigns – refused to do: retain real off-road capability while improving on-road dynamics, interior comfort and overall refinement. Helped in no small way by an all-new V6 as standard equipment, 2012 sees the bar raised an equal amount on the upper end of the Grand Cherokee ladder with an all-new SRT8, the brand’s performance halo. This is the bigger/badder variant of what is already a very responsive platform.

Driving the Used 2012 Chevrolet CruzeThe 2012 Chevy Cruze sedan offers two engine choices: a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder and a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. While the 1.8-liter engine is bigger, it is only available on the base LS Cruze and is nowhere near as fun to drive as the smaller turbocharged engine. Despite the smaller displacement, the 1.4-liter Ecotec engine is quiet and smooth, and actually produces the same horsepower as the 1.8-liter but with stronger low-end torque. If the turbo has one drawback, it’s the momentary lag experienced upon acceleration, a result of the few seconds it takes the turbocharger to wind up and do its power-boost thing. We were equally impressed with the Cruze sedan’s driving dynamics which are best described as sporty and fun, but not overly harsh. The adept suspension does a good job smoothing out small pavement irregularities, and during aggressive driving, it keeps the car fairly level and free of body roll. Added to save weight and fuel, the electric-assist power steering delivers good feedback and generally feels direct and well balanced.
Interior ComfortChevrolet spent a lot of time and effort the get the 2012 Cruze’s interior right, and it has paid off handsomely. The quality of the materials combined with their design and execution are far and away above anything else in this price range. Seat comfort, both front and rear, is another area where the Cruze sedan shines. Legroom up front is excellent while the rear seats offer a comfortable place for two adults – as long as the front seats are not fully extended. Attention to safety is evident by the Cruze’s 10 airbags, including front and rear seat-mounted side airbags and front knee airbags. Ample use of sound deadening material makes the Cruze sedan’s cabin one of the quietest in the segment.
Exterior StylingChevrolet gave the 2012 Cruze sedan an aggressive hood and front fender treatment connected to a split front grille that has become the company’s new ""face."" The Cruze’s wide stance and big wheel and tire combo impart a solid, stable look that makes the car seem larger than its compact status. Base models ride on 16-inch rims, with the more expensive models owning 17- and 18-inchers. For those who might prefer a more stylized ride, Chevrolet offers a number of exterior and interior appearance packages that add machine-finished wheels, a rear spoiler, body-colored mirrors and door handles, and fog lamps.
Favorite Features1.4-liter Ecotec Turbo EngineThe 2012 Chevrolet Cruze sedan’s 4-cylinder turbocharged engine not only delivers ample torque for a fun drive, it’s also quiet and fuel efficient.
RS TrimThe 2012 Chevy Cruze RS features bold rocker panels, fascia, lamp treatments and a spoiler on the outside, while inside chrome accents, ice-blue backlighting and an up-level instrument cluster complete the sporty look.
Standard FeaturesThe base Chevrolet Cruze LS comes equipped with a 1.8-liter Ecotec 4-cylinder engine, a 6-speed manual transmission, 10 airbags, air conditioning, keyless entry, and power windows and door locks. Opting for the 1LT model brings a 6-speed automatic transmission paired to a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, cruise control, Bluetooth, a USB port, power mirrors and steering wheel audio controls. The 2LT Cruze adds leather seating surfaces, a 6-way power driver’s seat and heated front seats. The top-of-the-line LTZ trim further enhances the Cruze sedan with rear park assist, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and dual-zone climate control.
Factory OptionsOptions on the 2012 Chevrolet Cruze vary by trim and include a Connectivity Package with Bluetooth, a USB Port for portable music devices and steering-wheel-mounted stereo controls. A sporty RS Package is also available, offering front fog lamps, rocker panel moldings and a rear spoiler. Stand-alone options include a power moonroof, rear parking sensors, GPS navigation and a Pioneer premium audio system.
Engine & TransmissionTwo engines are offered on the 2012 Chevrolet Cruze: A naturally-aspirated 1.8-liter 4-cylinder that produces 138 horsepower and 125 lb.-ft. of torque (standard on base LS models) and a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 138 horsepower and 148 lb.-ft. of torque. This year, addition of the 6-speed manual to the turbo models makes them ultimately more fun to drive, but we know the vast majority of Cruzes will go out the door with the very capable Hydra-Matic 6-speed automatic transmission. Using a combination of lighter materials, better aerodynamics and low-rolling-resistance tires allows the Cruze ECO to achieve hybrid-like fuel economy that exceeds 40 mpg.

One of the most competitive and lucrative segments in the auto industry is that of the compact car. Until recently, foreign competitors dominated the market, with Ford, Chevy and Dodge offering weak or sub-par offerings. But domestic manufactures have begun turning the tables on their overseas rivals and regaining the trust and confidence of American buyers. One example of this turnaround is the 2012 Chevrolet Cruze, a sleek and efficient compact that offers impressive features, handsome styling and fuel economy figures even the staunchest tree-hugger would concede are pretty darn good.

The available air-spring suspension delivers a ride as smooth and enjoyable as in some luxury sedans, and a healthy slathering of sound-deadening material throughout the Sequoia’s cabin keeps exterior wind and road noise to a minimum. Don’t get us wrong, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV is still a large and heavy vehicle, but its independent rear suspension and precise power steering make the 6,000-pound hulk quite easy to command. Aids such as the available proximity-warning system and rearview video camera help diminish the difficulty encountered when attempting to park or maneuver such a large vehicle. And, we should point out that while the 2012 Toyota Sequoia full-size SUV is able to successfully tackle gravel roads, wet and slippery boat ramps and steep snow-covered driveways, it is not a serious off-roader. 
Interior ComfortWhere some SUVs have a third-row seat that is best suited only for children, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia full-size SUV offers adult-sized seating in all three rows. The 2012 Toyota Sequoia’s second-row bench seat features three independently movable sections that travel fore and aft, as well as fold flat. For those who don’t require a bench seat, Captain’s-chair-style seats are available, as is a power-folding third-row seat. Access to the third-row seat is made simpler by wide and long rear doors and the sliding second-row seats. Stylistically, the Toyota Sequoia’s interior may you leave bit underwhelmed. Its plastic parts feel a bit hard, and there isn’t much in the way of warm color or rich wood trim. On the other hand, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV’s instrument panel is simple and uncluttered, with easy-to-see-and-operate controls and a dual glovebox for maximum storage.
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV is not only the longest SUV Toyota makes, it’s the widest and the tallest, too. Because the Sequoia’s axles are pushed as far from each other as engineers could manage, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV looks much longer than it really is. The expanded wheelbase is the primary reason for the Sequoia’s roomy interior, not to mention its admirable stability at highway speeds. The Sequoia’s short front and rear overhangs give the big SUV plenty of leeway when approaching steep angles, like those encountered when off-road adventuring or serving duty on a sharply raked boat ramp.
Favorite FeaturesPlentiful Rear Passenger RoomThe 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV provides expansive passenger room in the two rear rows, thanks to its redesigned independent rear suspension, long wheelbase and wide track. Fore-and-aft sliding second-row seats allow maximization of rear legroom, and rear doors open wide for easy access.
Variable Steering RatioTo ease maneuvering in tight situations, such as parking or off-roading, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia’s steering ratio increases just before the steering wheel is turned to its limit, which helps to significantly reduce the turning circle.
Standard FeaturesThe 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV’s standard safety features include anti-lock brakes and electronic traction and stability control. Larger disc brakes all around and the brake-assist system help to minimize emergency stopping distances. The 2012 Toyota Sequoia has eight airbags, including full-length side-curtain head protection and front knee protection. The SR5 comes with standard 18-inch wheels. A powerful, 3-zone climate control helps keep all passengers comfortable. Sliding, 40/20/40-split second-row seats maximize rear-passenger legroom, and rear bench seats fold forward to create a large, flat cargo area. The steering column has both tilt and fore-and-aft adjustments.
Factory OptionsAll three trim levels of the 2012 Toyota Sequoia full-size SUV are available with either rear- or 4-wheel drive (4WD). The optional air-spring rear suspension not only automatically adjusts to changing cargo, passenger and trailer-tongue weight, but also contributes to a smoother ride when the vehicle is unloaded. The Limited trim offers only three stand-alone options: navigation, 7-passenger seating (second-row captain’s chairs) and a rear-seat entertainment system that includes a 9-inch LCD display and a 115-volt AC outlet. The sonar-based proximity warning system reduces strain when parking and backing out, and the satellite navigation system also includes a rearview video camera. The Platinum trim comes fully loaded.
Engine & TransmissionStandard on the 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV is a 4.6-liter V8 good for 310 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque. The available 5.7-liter V8 produces 401 lb-ft of torque, which helps the Sequoia tow trailers up to 7,400 pounds. Both V8s are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, which employs a very low first gear for strong acceleration and two overdrive gears for better fuel economy. Unlike older truck-based 4-wheel-drive systems, the Sequoia’s can be employed on dry or wet paved roads, and can be operated in rear-wheel drive or low-range 4-wheel drive.

If you just can’t live without the people hauling and pulling power afforded by a big, V8-powered SUV, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV deserves a spot on your wish list. In fact, there are only a few such SUVs on the market, the most obvious being the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition and Nissan Armada. If towing ability is a top priority, the big Chevy/GMC twins win hands down, but if you think can live with a 381-horsepower Lexus-derived V8 and 7,400-pound tow rating, then purchasing a 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV makes perfect sense. The Sequoia’s roomy interior and 3-row seating provide all the room a family can possibly need, plus the flat-folding seats can be lowered to create a level cargo floor. And, unlike its primary competitors, the 2012 Toyota Sequoia SUV offers a choice of two V8 engines permitting a lower-cost alternative for those who don’t need power as much as a reasonable bottom line.

While the 2012 Ford Mustang is fun for two, its rear seat is best suited to children or very limber adults.",23000,"Driving the Used 2012 Ford MustangRefusing to give up its solid rear axle design, Ford has created for the 2012 Mustang an inexpensive rear suspension that performs quite well and is as comfortable in cruise as it is quick in the corners. The driver selectable steering enhances feel, response and predictability. Add in the AdvanceTrac stability control system and powerful anti-lock disc brakes, and the 2012 Ford Mustang maintains its composure quite well in the turns, although the back end can be made to step out when too much throttle is applied – which immediately activates the stability control. The GT has a driver selectable AdvanceTrac system that includes a less restrictive Sport mode. In V6 form, the 2012 Mustang delivers up 305 horsepower and packs a punch, yet still tops the 30-mpg mark in highway driving. The heart and soul of the Mustang, however, is the 5.0-liter V8, with 412 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque and matched with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic.
Interior ComfortThe 2012 Ford Mustang’s interior is a great place to spend time. Traditional design elements from the first Mustang include a soft-touch one-piece dash pad, bright chrome accents and brushed aluminum trim. Highlights include a 160-mph speedometer, Ford’s MyColor configurable dash that allows the driver to choose from 125 color combinations, and an 8-inch color touch-screen for the optional navigation system. Thanks to an extensive use of sound deadening material, the 2012 Mustang’s interior is exceedingly quiet even with the roaring V8 engine. We like the Mustang’s front seats very much, finding them both supportive yet snug enough to hold one in place during aggressive driving.
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Ford Mustang shows originality and retro. Historical elements that made the first car such a hit include the galloping pony in the grille and the staggered sequential LED rear turn indicators. But the 2012 Mustang’s power-bulged hood, big wheels and steeply-raked windshield never appeared on the original model. The integrated headlamp/turn-indicator unit pays homage to the 1970 Mustang, while the big 5.0-liter badges on the GT’s front fenders play up on the 1980s Mustang. A wide and deep grille insert serves as the backdrop for a more stylized galloping pony emblem as well as prominent fog lamps on GT models. 
Favorite Features3.7-liter V6Unless you absolutely revel in the idea of having a V8, the new 3.7-liter V6 is more than enough engine, producing horsepower and torque figures that surpass the output of many previous-generation Mustang GTs!
Comprehensive Interior Upgrades Better quality and enhanced features make it a much nicer world inside every 2012 Mustang. Highlighting the mix are a one-piece soft-touch dash and more finger-friendly controls that are further complemented by variable interior ambient lighting and, on Premium models, selectable MyColor illumination.
Standard FeaturesAll 2012 Ford Mustangs are impressively packaged. Even the base V6 comes with air conditioning, power windows/locks/mirrors, keyless remote entry, AM/FM/CD stereo with AUX input, Selectable Electronic Power Steering Assist (EPAS), cruise control, Electronic Stability Control (ESC; includes anti-lock brakes), front and front-side airbags, and Ford’s SOS Post-Crash Alert system. The Premium versions add leather upholstery, trim enhancements, an upgraded instrument cluster with MyColor variable lighting, Shaker 500 audio system with SYNC and SIRIUS Satellite Radio, power driver’s seat, and a split-folding rear seat on coupes. The GT has a 412-horsepower, 5.0-liter V8 engine, automatic headlamps, rear spoiler, fog lamps, a black-chrome pony grille badge, and cloth instead of synthetic material on the Convertible’s power top. 
Factory OptionsKey extras for the base V6 2012 Mustang are a 6-speed automatic transmission, the Reverse Sensing System and Security Package, and a Convertible soft boot. The V6 Premium offers the base-level upgrades plus the V6 Performance Package (strut tower brace, larger anti-roll bars, 19-inch black painted wheels, recalibrated electronic stability control, performance brake pads and a 3.31:1 rear axle ratio). The GT Premium offers the California Special package (chrome billet grille, side scoops and 19-inch wheels). The GT trim offers the Brembo Brake Package, recalibrated stability program and 19-inch wheels with P255/40R19 tires. HID bi-xenon headlamps, a glass roof, back-up camera and several packages – including the Electronic (Navigation with SIRIUS, HD Radio and dual-zone auto climate control) and Comfort (leather-trimmed heated front seats and a six-way power passenger seat) – are available on Premium versions.
Engine & TransmissionThe base 2012 Ford Mustang is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7-liter V6 engine featuring dual overhead cams (DOHC) and Twin-Independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT). The result is 305 horsepower with fuel economy comparable to some four-cylinder cars. Ford’s 6-speed automatic features a ""Hill Mode"" function that extends gear operation on uphill climbs and provides additional engine braking upon descent; Ford does not offer a manually-selectable shift program with this transmission. Stepping up to the 5.0-liter V8 (also equipped with Ti-VCT technology) brings 412 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque; the Boss 302 has 444 horsepower and 380 lb-ft Our time in the Mustang GT produced zero-to-60-mph runs under five seconds.

New features available on the 2012 Ford Mustang include dual illuminated visor vanity mirrors, a remote garage door opener, the Reverse Sensing System and HID headlamps.
Ford’s iconic pony car, the 2012 Mustang, keeps going strong. Although some may argue the 2012 Mustang’s styling isn’t as eye-popping as the Camaro, its performance easily matches its long-time Chevy rival and others, including the Dodge Challenger and Hyundai Genesis. With the base car’s V6 engine producing 305 horsepower – more than some V8s of just a few years back – the Mustang is not only fast, it’s affordable. The GT model is a V8-powered dynamo with a snarling exhaust note, available 6-speed manual transmission and ripping performance. More than just a flashback, the newest Mustang also attracts younger buyers who want the experience of a torque-heavy V8. Available in Coupe or Convertible, V6, V8, high-performance V8 (Boss 302) and screamingly fast V8 (Shelby GT500), the 2012 Ford Mustang isn’t all things to all people, but it comes close.

Next to vehicles like the Kia Sportage and Volkswagen Tiguan, the Escape Hybrid struggles to stand out.",31000,"Driving the Used 2012 Ford EscapeFrom the driver’s point of view, sitting behind the wheel of a 2012 Escape Hybrid is very much like driving a standard Escape, that is, until you encounter stop-and-go traffic. In slow-speed situations the Escape Hybrid’s electric motor does almost all the work, meaning the vehicle is emitting zero pollutants as well as very little noise. The ghostly manner in which the Escape Hybrid glides about is a bit unnerving at first, giving the feeling the engine has stalled. But, once you adapt to the Escape Hybrid shutting its engine off at stops and then restarting it once underway, the vehicle begins to feel just like any other car. Of course, once the battery pack runs low or you begin to move at speeds above 44 mph, the gasoline engine comes online full time. Amazingly, even with the gasoline engine engaged, the Escape’s fuel economy remains above the 30 mpg mark.
Interior ComfortAlthough the interior of the 2012 Ford Escape Hybrid breaks no new ground stylistically, its overall execution is worth noting. Quality plastics have a nice look and feel, and the instruments are backlit in an easy-to-view Ice Blue illumination. Generous use of insulation throughout the cabin returns a surprisingly quiet ride, and clever features, such as the soy-based foam used to construct the seats, validate the Escape Hybrid’s status as a cutting-edge green machine. Ford’s clever placement of the battery pack under the floor means the Hybrid gives up nothing in the way of interior space, leaving the Escape’s roomy rear seat and large cargo area intact. On models equipped with the available navigation unit, the hybrid drive system can be monitored showing when the vehicle is running on pure electric power as well as when the battery pack is being recharged.
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Ford Escape Hybrid doesn’t look like the typical hybrid. There is no video game-style instrumentation or funky exterior shapes, just the same squared-off front end and boxy passenger compartment that define so many of Ford’s trucks and SUVs. A bold egg-crate-style chrome grille sets off the front end, while thick black plastic runners protect the Escape Hybrid’s sides and lower grille. The Escape Hybrid looks almost identical to the gasoline-powered Escape, with only a few ""Hybrid"" badges and unique 16-inch aluminum wheels to set it apart. The Limited trim adds bright machined aluminum wheels, lower chrome grille extension, chrome liftgate handle, chrome roof-rail inserts and driver’s door keyless entry keypad.
Favorite FeaturesNavigation SystemWe’re always glad for the ability to quickly and easily find the nearest caffeine station.
Active Park AssistA feature usually found only on super-luxury cars, the Escape Hybrid’s Active Park Assist uses sonar and the electric power steering unit to automatically guide the Escape into an open parallel parking spot. Voice prompts tell the driver when to shift gears and apply power.
Standard FeaturesEquipped similarly to the XLT gasoline-only model, the 2012 Escape Hybrid includes dual-zone climate control, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD sound system with auxiliary audio input jack, Ford SYNC communication and entertainment system, SIRIUS Satellite Radio, power windows/locks/mirrors, remote keyless entry, cruise control and 16-inch aluminum wheels. Standard safety equipment includes six airbags and anti-lock brakes (ABS), as well as AdvanceTrac traction control with Roll Stability Control. The Limited trim adds 16-inch bright machined aluminum wheels, chrome exterior and interior accents, a 6-disc in-dash CD changer, ambient lighting, leather seating, a power moonroof, the Reverse Sensing System, heated front seats, heated side mirrors and a driver’s door keyless entry keypad.
Factory OptionsSome of the 2012 Ford Escape Hybrid’s more desirable options include DVD navigation with 10GB hard drive music storage, rearview camera, MyKey, Active Park Assist, 4-wheel drive, integrated side step bars, remote start, rear-seat DVD entertainment system and roof-rack crossbars.
Engine & TransmissionAs a so-called ""full hybrid"" the Ford Escape Hybrid is capable of running on battery power alone, at speeds up to about 25 mph. According to Ford, the system delivers 0-to-60-mph acceleration equivalent to that of a 240-horsepower V6. Power is transmitted to the front- or optional four-wheel-drive (4WD) system via a ""gearless"" continuously-variable transmission. A new electric power steering system requires less effort from the driver to keep the vehicle headed straight on slanted roads or in steady side winds.

Hybrid cars, for the most part, emphasize fuel efficiency over capability. In the real world, however, Americans need their cars to do all manner of chores, which is why so many have switched to some form of CUV or SUV. Believing you shouldn’t have to sacrifice one benefit for another, Ford has created the 2012 Escape Hybrid, a rugged, roomy CUV with a hybrid drivetrain that is as easy on the planet as it is on your monthly gasoline budget. Of course, there are other hybrid CUVs out there but almost all are high-priced luxury models, with the closest in price being the Toyota Highlander Hybrid. And, while it is obvious that the Escape Hybrid’s highway fuel economy is not all that much better than the gasoline-powered Escape, the hybrid’s 34 mpg city rating is nothing to scoff at. Besides, a hybrid isn’t just about saving fuel; it’s about promoting new technologies and leaving a smaller carbon footprint.

ConsWhile the Outlander returns adequate fuel economy figures, the Hyundai Tucson, Chevrolet Equinox and the all-new Mazda CX-5 deliver greater fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the Outlander’s taut suspension may be unsettling for drivers looking for a more relaxed, forgiving ride.",23000,"Driving the Used 2012 Mitsubishi OutlanderOn the road, the Mitsubishi Outlander’s excellent steering and brake feel, sport-tuned suspension and supportive front seats deliver a balance of comfort and confidence that will accommodate a range of driving styles. And though many of its competitors like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape can tackle road imperfections with greater poise, we found the Outlander’s lively handling characteristics to be worth the insignificant drop in ride quality. While the standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is right-sized for basic daily driving tasks, most will find the available 230-horsepower V6 is more accommodating to heavy loads and spirited driving. On the fuel economy front, 2012 Outlander GT models offer a unique piece of fuel-saving technology called Idle Neutral Logic that automatically shifts the transmission into neutral when the vehicle arrives at a complete stop.
Interior ComfortInside the Mitsubishi Outlander is a clean layout with distinguishable controls and plentiful storage space. With the rear seats folded, the Outlander can accommodate nearly 73 cubic feet of cargo – comparable to the class-leading Toyota RAV4. The Outlander’s versatile interior offers a variety of configurations for occupants and their gear, including a 60/40 split/fold-flat rear seat with a sliding function for enhanced passenger comfort and a small, yet handy, stowable third-row seat for SE and GT trims. The Outlander’s principal shortcoming would be the ES and SE model’s abundance of hard plastics and flat surfaces that emit a budget feel when compared to competitors like the Hyundai Tucson, Honda CR-V and the new Ford Escape.
Exterior StylingThe 2012 Outlander commands a much larger presence than most vehicles in this category, led by its ""jet fighter""-inspired trapezoidal grille and bulging fender arches. LED taillights and available xenon headlights (standard on GT trims) help communicate a level of refinement while GT models enhance the Outlander’s athletic demeanor with a pair of chrome exhaust tips and a black-out front bumper insert. The wheel lineup ranges from the ES grade’s 16-inch steel wheels to the 18-inch 7-spoke alloys found on SE and GT models.
Favorite FeaturesFuse Voice RecognitionSimilar to Ford’s voice-activated Sync system, Mitsubishi’s Fuse allows voice control of Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones for hands-free phone capability as well as streaming audio. The system also provides advanced voice recognition commands for iPods, including Genre, Artist, Album or Playlist.
Flap-Fold LiftgateAn SUV with an abundance of cargo space and fold-flat seating is great for large cumbersome objects, but a protruding rear bumper can make loading such cargo an aggravating experience. Every 2012 Outlander features a unique tailgate-style rear bumper that folds level with the cargo floor, making it easier to slide bulky objects in and out.
Standard FeaturesThe 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander is offered in three trims: ES, SE and GT. Standard across the board is rear privacy glass, LED taillights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a 60/40 split/fold-flat second-row seat and auto-off headlights. SE models add magnesium paddle shifters, 18-inch alloy wheels, a Fast Key entry and starting system – the key fob never needs to leave your pocket or bag – and a fold-flat third-row seat. The range-topping GT models add a 230-horsepower V6 engine, xenon headlights that are up to three times brighter than conventional halogen bulbs, and automatic climate control. Safety features include six airbags, active front head restraints and a reinforced body structure for enhanced collision protection.
Factory OptionsAll Outlander trims offer an available 40GB hard drive-based navigation system with real-time traffic, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones, and Mitsubishi’s Fuse voice recognition system. SE and GT models offer all-wheel drive, a rear backup camera, a power tilt/slide moonroof, and a 710-watt Rockford-Fosgate audio system with a 10-inch subwoofer. The GT’s exclusive Touring Package includes leather-trimmed seating, heated front seats, and a power-adjustable driver’s seat.
Engine & TransmissionMitsubishi provides a choice of a 168-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with variable valve timing, or a more powerful 230-horsepower V6. Despite the Outlander GT’s fuel-saving Neutral Idle Control feature, ES and SE models and their 4-cylinder powerplants deliver an observable increase in fuel economy over the V6. The 4-cylinder engine drives through a continuously variable transmission (CVT) while the V6 is fitted to a manually selectable 6-speed automatic accompanied by steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.

As one of the larger vehicles in its segment, the 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander strikes a satisfying balance between compact and mid-size SUVs. The Outlander differentiates itself from the competition with an array of optional tech features along with aggressive styling, generous cargo space and available seating for seven.

Confident cornering aided by a nicely weighted steering wheel gave us the permission to push the Optima hard, and the electronic traction and stability controls always intervened to save us when we pushed a bit too hard. The naturally aspirated 2.4-liter engine develops an impressive 200 horsepower. This gasoline direct-injection engine is smooth, powerful and able to cruise 35 highway miles on a single gallon of gasoline (24 miles in city driving). Whether it was passing slow-moving traffic or climbing steep grades, the 2012 Kia Optima’s 4-cylinder engine never failed to impress us. Of course, there is a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine for those who crave more power. Equally as smooth and quiet as the 2.4-liter engine, the 2.0T pumps out 274 horsepower and is mated to a 6-speed Sportmatic manually shifting automatic transmission. Fuel-economy fans will likely flock to the 2012 Kia Optima Hybrid sedan that earns an estimated 35 mpg city and 40 mpg highway.
Interior ComfortWith a clear nod to Saab dash design, the Kia engineers have created an instrument panel that is quite frankly a refreshing change from the ubiquitous hooded gauge cluster and center-stacked audio- and ventilation-control layout. On upper-end EX and SX trims, customers can opt for such extravagant features as a dual-panel moonroof, heated and cooling front seats, heated rear seats and a voice-activated navigation and infotainment system similar to Ford’s SYNC. While we love the look of the 2012 Kia Optima sedan’s interior, some of the plastic on the dash and steering wheel still lack the quality look and feel found in Honda, Mazda and even some GM and Ford products. The front seats are pretty comfortable for tall folks, but the Optima’s sharply raked rear roofline may cause some headroom issues for the rear-seat passengers.
Exterior StylingLooking a bit like something from the sci-fi movie Tron, the 2012 Kia Optima is a bold and original piece of work from the ground up. From its cross-hatch front grille and long sweptback headlight housing, to the weather-vane-style wheels on the SX trim, the Optima looks like it’s going fast even when it’s parked. There is a duality about the 2012 Kia Optima sedan, speaking to both luxury and performance all while masking its true nature to serve duty as a humble family sedan. Even base trims offer such nice features as heated side mirrors, chrome door handle inserts and 16-inch wheels.

The 2012 Kia Optima Hybrid features lightweight wheels in your choice of standard 16-inch or sporty 17-inch casting, as well as the EcoMinder LCD panel with graphics and lighting that change to show when the car is achieving maximum fuel economy.
Engine & TransmissionThe 2012 Kia Optima sedan doesn’t offer the option of a V6, and why should it. The standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder is nearly as powerful as some V6 engines and gets far better fuel economy. The Optima’s 2.4-liter engine boasts more power and better fuel economy than other 4-cylinder cars in the category, too. Those wanting more power can opt for a turbocharged 2.0 liter (EX Turbo and SX trims only). Both engines are offered with a 6-speed automatic, while the base trim (LX) offers a 6-speed manual. The Optima Hybrid uses the 2.4-liter engine mated to a 40-horsepower electric motor for a combined output of 206 horsepower.

Those who need to tow heavy loads or enjoy going far off-road will be better served by a V8-powered body-on-frame SUV such as the Chevy Tahoe or Ford Expedition.",29000,"Driving the Used 2012 Honda PilotDespite its size, the 2012 Honda Pilot SUV rides and drives very much like a large car. The firm suspension limits body roll, squat, and dive, yet is not so firm as to punish its passengers with every passing pothole or road distortion. We found the Pilot’s steering a bit heavily weighted, but it is very precise and offers good feedback in the turns. On the highway the Pilot SUV tracks straight, and even strong wind gusts can’t deter it from its intended course. The interior seems quieter than many large SUVs we’ve tested, but that’s not a scientific finding, only a sense we get from test driving so many of the Honda Pilot’s competitors. We love the 3.5-liter V6 for its gutsy response when we demand to go fast, and for its smooth, silent operation. We also like the fuel economy, which is near the best in this class. Although we didn’t have a chance to test the Pilot’s AWD system in the snow, we did venture up some dirt fire roads and found the VTM-4 AWD setup to be fairly capable of keeping the Pilot SUV moving forward through dirt, loose gravel and mud. A lock mode on the Pilot’s transmission mimics a low-range transfer case, keeping power permanently flowing to all four wheels at speeds under 18 mph.
Interior ComfortIn keeping with Honda’s simple but functional design philosophy, the 2012 Pilot SUV’s interior is a study in efficiency. The dash and instruments are easy to operate and logically placed. There are no fancy light shows here, no radical designs that look neat but don’t work well in the real world, just the basics. Of course, the Honda Pilot’s interior is by no means stark, and in EX-L trim it is downright plush. Legroom is more than adequate in all three rows, an unusual and welcome attribute in this class. Rear cargo space with the third-row seat in place, however, is not so abundant. Luckily, there is a large cargo bin below the floor for storing items, as well as ample roof space for a carrier rack. Fold the seats flat, and the 2012 Honda Pilot SUV can be used like a small pickup truck, or a sturdy steel tent with cozy accommodation for two.
Exterior StylingWith its new face, the 2012 Honda Pilot SUV somewhat softens its boxy and bland image, making it a bit more palatable to the fashion-conscious SUV driver. Still present are the Pilot’s long wheelbase and short front and rear overhangs, a design that not only makes the 2012 Pilot SUV look more solid and stable, but that allows for easy maneuvering in tight spots. Honda’s ACE (Advanced Compatibility Engineering) body structure ensures maximum strength from the unit body, permitting the front end to absorb more energy in the event of an impact and keeping the passenger compartment (and its contents) from harm. Stylistically, the new 17- and 18-inch wheels really bring out the best in the Pilot SUV’s design, while clever features such as the flip-up glass window on the tailgate and the standard integrated tow-hitch serve a more functional purpose.
Favorite FeaturesRearview Mirror Camera Display Available on the EX-L trim, this 2.5-inch LCD display – conveniently located in the rearview mirror – shows you what’s behind the vehicle while in reverse. 
Second Row SeatingThe 2012 Honda Pilot SUV’s second row offers excellent room for taller passengers and also provides LATCH systems for three child seats.

The EX, EX-L and Touring Pilots add an 8-way power driver’s seat, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, daytime running lights, Bluetooth and heated side mirrors. Exclusive to the EX-L is a rearview camera with a display screen imbedded in the rearview mirror.
Factory OptionsMost of the additional features for the 2012 Honda Pilot SUV are tied to trim level and are not available as stand-alone extras.

Engine & TransmissionThe 2012 Honda Pilot’s engine comes equipped with Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) technology, allowing for an uptick in horsepower and torque, as well as improved fuel economy. This VCM technology, similar to the system used in the current Honda Accord, allows the vehicle to seamlessly run on three, four, or six cylinders, depending on driving conditions and requirements.

Read Full Review","What's New?The 2012 Honda Pilot SUV receives a major front-end makeover, with more rounded edges, a softer grille and more chrome trim. EX and EX-L trims gain updated audio systems that include a 2GB CD library, Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity, and streaming audio, while the EX-L gains an 8-inch color Multi-Information Display. All trims see a 1 mpg increase in fuel economy.
The 2012 Honda Pilot SUV nails the right combination of size, power, ability and value. Not as gargantuan as the Chevy Tahoe or Suburban, the Pilot can still accommodate eight people, has plenty of room for cargo and gets reasonably good gas mileage for its size. On the downside, the Pilot offers only a V6 engine, can’t tackle Jeep-style off-road situations, and can only tow up to 4,500 pounds (2,000 pounds for the 2-wheel-drive model). To spur sales, the 2012 Pilot SUV receives new styling that somewhat negates previous complaints about the vehicle’s lackluster looks. Of course, with fierce competition from such heavyweights as the Mazda CX-9, GMC Acadia, Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner, the Pilot isn’t a shoo-in for best-in-class, even with its lofty Honda pedigree. Lacking some more modern features, such as the Explorer’s adjustable AWD terrain settings and SYNC communication technology, the Pilot may not cut it with avid off-road junkies and techno types. But, for those who simply seek dependable, efficient and comfortable transportation for themselves and their family, the 2012 Honda Pilot SUV is an easy choice.
